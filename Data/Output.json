This was most certainly seen as a stepping-stone in bringing the crypto and traditional financial markets together – offering a regulated pathway for investment in digital assets.","title":"Crypto IRAs Take Center Stage as Investors Seek Retirement Wealth in the Bull Run","content":["In Q1 2024, the SEC in its landmark judgment approved the listing and trading of a number of spot bitcoin ETFs – including those by BlackRock, Vanguard and Franklin Templeton. This was most certainly seen as a stepping-stone in bringing the crypto and traditional financial markets together – offering a regulated pathway for investment in digital assets.","But still not many investors from both Web3 and traditional investment backgrounds seem to fully understand the key differences between investing in bitcoin versus investing in bitcoin ETFs.","When you purchase bitcoin you gain full ownership and control over your assets (lest we forget with unlimited trading hours and potentially lower fees). But there are some downsides to be aware of. First, you need technical blockchain wallet know-how and an understanding of cryptoeconomics. Secondly, and more importantly, you can’t include your bitcoin investment in traditional retirement plans like 401(k)s.","Investing in bitcoin ETFs can also be advantageous for a few reasons: Ease of access, simplified investment, regulatory and security benefits, market integration, liquidity, diversification and potential tax benefits. The main downside is that you don’t really personally possess actual bitcoin. Add to this high management fees, operational costs, market hours limitation and potential tracking errors.","But what if there was a third option? One that combines the positives of both – direct bitcoin ownership and bitcoin ETFs – while also addressing their respective negatives? If you live in the United States, chances are that you have already heard of an IRA (short for “Individual Retirement Account”), a long-term, tax-advantaged savings account designed for individuals with earned income to save for retirement.","In recent years, IRAs have gone on to cover a broad spectrum – including cryptocurrencies, known as Crypto IRAs – a self-directed Individual Retirement Account (SDIRA) which allows investors to include digital currencies like bitcoin, ethereum and others in their retirement portfolios. And as more investors are flocking to Crypto IRAs in the middle of this ongoing bull run, it\u0027s quite evident that the future of retirement planning is becoming increasingly intertwined with the world of digital assets.","Investing in a Crypto IRA can offer several benefits and advantages: Tax-advantaged growth (either tax-deferred or tax-free), digital asset security and diversification. By incorporating cryptocurrencies into retirement savings, investors are bullish on adding this decentralized asset class to their portfolios – potentially maximizing the compounding effect of investments while minimizing immediate tax liabilities.","Let\u0027s consider a simple example to illustrate the tax benefits. Say you buy $25,000 worth of bitcoin and it increases to $65,000. That\u0027s a $40,000 gain. While this sounds great, the issue is that these profits are now subject to capital gains tax. In comparison, if you buy $25,000 worth of bitcoin in a Roth IRA (with tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and its value increases to $65,000 you\u0027ve still made a $40,000 gain.","And the best part is that when you sell in the future, you\u0027re not subject to capital gains tax and you can keep all of your profits.","But for crypto IRAs to pave the way for the future of retirement investing, we need a trustworthy, reliable and user-friendly approach. We need a solution that not only simplifies the process of buying and selling crypto through tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but also keeps costs low, stays transparent and makes investing in crypto assets with IRAs a walk in the park.","One such platform is iTrustCapital, led by CEO Kevin Maloney, a former compliance officer at the $2.5 trillion asset management firm PIMCO, and best known for working closely with regulatory agencies like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).","The platform has seen a surge in activity recently, with both an influx of new accounts being funded and a large number of holding accounts coming back to life, no doubt after reigniting their interest in the crypto space. Clients who were inactive during the bear market are now returning in droves – not just to check their accounts but to start transacting again.","Clients enjoy the flexibility of being able to buy and sell digital assets 24/7 – unlike ETFs which are only available for trading during market hours. This round-the-clock access allows investors to make decisions based on real-time market movements and their own investment strategies.","iTrustCapital offers a wide range of digital assets for investors to choose from – including popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum and a variety of altcoins. Such an approach allows investors to diversify their portfolios within the crypto space – potentially mitigating risk and capitalizing on emerging opportunities.","Another significant advantage is the ability to buy and sell within the account without creating a taxable event. Clients can buy and sell different digital assets and only incur a small fee, similar to other exchanges. This feature is particularly valuable for investors looking to rebalance their portfolios or take advantage of market fluctuations without worrying about immediate tax implications.","iTrustCapital also offers the option to move assets from other crypto IRAs into its platform. This flexibility allows investors who may be dissatisfied with the limited offerings or high fees from their current provider, to consolidate their crypto holdings under one roof. Thus, investors can enjoy an extensive range of digital assets and a competitive fee structure with iTrustCapital.","iTrustCapital has leveraged the regulated infrastructure of experienced third party compliance and custodial services in Web3. The company has done so by evaluating potential partners based on its deep domain knowledge, clean charters, excellent technology platforms and outstanding experience teams committed to doing the right thing. Ultimately, the company uses a regulated, state-chartered trust company to hold the self-directed IRAs and custody client assets.","The goal is to prioritize customer trust and safety around the purchase and safeguarding of their digital assets. In order to ensure reliability and peace of mind, iTrustCapital never takes custody of its clients\u0027 assets, nor does it leverage those assets for profit.","Moreover, iTrustCapital holds clients\u0027 assets \"off-balance sheet,\" meaning that client assets are never actually recorded on the company\u0027s financial statements. By not including those assets, the company\u0027s business activities, its financial ratios and its overall leverage strategy remain unaffected by the amount of assets held for their clients. This approach demonstrates iTrustCapital\u0027s commitment to being fully transparent with its customer base and to continuously follow ethical practices.","Including iTrustCapital in your IRA strategy means knowing that your assets are safe and secure with a company that puts the highest value on customer trust.","Looking ahead, it\u0027s plausible that Crypto IRAs will become an increasingly common component of retirement portfolios. More investors are recognizing the potential benefits of including digital assets in their retirement portfolios – whether for diversification, long-term growth or as a hedge against traditional market volatility.","As younger generations who are more comfortable with digital assets begin to plan for their financial futures, platforms like iTrustCapital, through its wide range of digital assets and the security of a regulated custodian, will be well-positioned to capitalize on this growing demand for Crypto IRAs.","If you are looking for more information on how to start your crypto IRA with iTrustCapital, visit the website: https://www.itrustcapital.com/. iTrustCapital does not provide legal, investment or tax advice.

FTT futures had a relatively lesser $27 million in liquidations – implying the steep drop was mostly driven by sales of spot tokens.","Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position because of a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).","FTX came under scrutiny following a CoinDesk report last week that found the balance sheet of Alameda Research, a crypto trading unit owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, who also owns FTX, was full of FTX’s native FTT tokens. This meant that Alameda rested on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto.","The report sparked rumors of FTX becoming possibly insolvent, which in turn led to industry players selling FTX-linked coins to protect their own downside. Rival Binance, which held over $500 million of FTT on its books, started to offload its holdings – which culminated in a 24-hour-long drama that ended with Binance signing an intent to acquire FTX, which is now considered by many to be insolvent.","Such market dynamics spooked crypto markets as traders reacted to possible contagion risks.

To date, it has polarized blockchain experts while winning scores of newcomers to the technology.","The brain-child of Daniel Larimer, founder of BitShares, and Ned Scott, a former financial analyst, Steemit aims to provide a place for individuals to create content, promote the content they believe is good and comment on stories — all while earning money.","But Steemit is more than just a website for earning spare change.","It’s an actual blockchain built on a piece of technology developed by Larimer called Graphene, which allows for the deployment of application-specific blockchains.","Scott, in interview with CoinDesk, explained that the team only had the idea for Steemit back in January and, because of the Graphene framework, they were able to quickly roll the project out.","The rest, like most things in the blockchain space, is a bit difficult to explain.","For the first few months, there wasn’t much talk about Steemit.","While there were early miners and people contributing content, the real big bang didn’t come until 4th July. When the dam opened, $1.3m worth of stored-up blockchain-based currency called \"steem\" was released to those that had been participating on the platform.","Scott explained that, while all of the blog posts, comments and upvotes that had occurred on the site pre-July 4th were all on the blockchain, the rewards users had been promised for their contributions had not been distributed. The underlying idea was that the team wanted to continue testing the platform, finding bugs and fixing them prior to a rush of new people signing up.","He cautioned that, no matter how diligent the development team is, there are going to be bugs and that they wanted to ensure that Steemit was safe and secure for everyone.","Nevertheless, 4th July was a day that they had all been looking forward to.","Scott said:","And with that pop, users who had been watching their balances rise were instantly rewarded.","Part of the confusion with Steemit lies in the different ways that the currency is presented to users.","At the root is the currency Steem, which is the typical transferrable, fungible, freely moveable token akin to bitcoin, ethereum or any other cryptocurrency. But that same Steem can be put into two different types of smart contracts depending on the particular utility an individual wants.","The first is called Steem Power, which provides utility and leverage. Steem Power is the backbone of an account\u0027s voting-potential. In other words, the more Steem Power an individual has, the stronger their vote is on Steemit.","Scott explained that the team wanted to provide a mechanism by which individuals could take a long-term interest in the project, while allowing others to continue with their speculation. In the white paper, Steem Power is compared to long-term capital commitments, similar to what a venture capitalist might do.","While users can invest their money instantly, there is an expectation that it will take time to see a return on that investment.","In the case of Steem Power, should a user want to convert back to the base currency of Steem, it will need to occur in 104 weekly conversions.","The second smart contract is called Steem Dollars. This is a debt-like instrument that promises to distribute $1 worth of Steem to the token holder at some point in the future.","Scott explained:","This seven-day conversion process is meant to minimize the ability to create arbitrage attacks by market timers. If the Steem Dollars were convertible to Steem immediately, a user could take advantage of a difference in price, convert their Steem Dollars into regular Steem and earn more than the $1 worth the smart contract intended for it.","Because it is a stable debt instrument, users who hold Steem Dollars miss out on any Steem price increases. If Steem is worth $1 and this conversion took place, the individual would receive 1 Steem for every Steem Dollar they owned. If Steem rose to $2, the individual would receive 0.5 Steem for every Steem Dollar they owned.","To compensate for the locked value, Steem Dollars accrue interest. At time of story, users that hold Steem Dollars will earn 10% a year in interest, paid out in Steem Dollars.","There are two methods of earning Steem on Steemit.","The first is by writing a blog post. As that blog post accrues votes, the amount of Steem that will be distributed to the writer increase.","However, every vote on the site is not worth a flat amount of money. Instead, the amount earned is based on both the number of votes an individual receives and the amount of Steem Power a voter has.","For example, if one user had 1,000 Steem Power and another had 10,000 Steem Power, it\u0027s clear that the latter has a more powerful account than the former. The effect of each of those two people voting on a piece of content is not equal; specifically, the user with 10,000 Steem Power\u0027s vote is worth more.","This has resulted in the development of a sort of whale chasing culture, whereby writers hope to convince the large Steem Power holders to give them upvotes. A vote by Scott or Larimer has been seen to increase the value of a post by hundreds of dollars, resulting in a pile-on effect where others chase the post.","To incentivize this sort of voting, there is also the curation reward paid out in the form of Steem Power. If a post does well, you earn more Steem Power than if a post doesn’t do well, thus incentivizing you to only vote for content that you believe is high quality.","Further, not every vote from the same account is equal in value. Voting on multiple pieces of content reduces the strength of each of your votes depending on how much time passes between each vote. Scott explained voting power by comparing it to certain video games.","He said:","There are two reward pool distributions.","The first is approximately 12 hours after the post has been submitted. The reward, denominated in US dollars, is released to the writer divided evenly between Steem Power and Steem Dollars. Voters receive the reward entirely in Steem Power. The second reward pool distribution occurs one month later.","A blockchain without security is not one anyone would have faith in.","Steemit gains its security from a delegated proof-of-stake algorithm, first developed for Larimer\u0027s BitShares project, which is a variation of proof-of-stake. A true proof-of-stake algorithm, such as peercoin, relies on those who hold the currency to verify transactions.","The more currency held by a wider variety of people, the more secure the network is.","In a delegated proof-of-stake system, the community votes for individuals, called witnesses, to be responsible for verifying transactions.","The easiest way to think about it is proof-of-stake is true democracy similar to ancient Athens. Delegated proof-of-stake is more of a democratic republic, such as the US. By that logic, witnesses are like Congressmen, elected by the community to be responsible for securing the network.","However, the analogy ends there, because witnesses can be kicked out of their job for not doing it, something the US Congress has been immune to for some time.","Scott said:","In total, there are 21 witnesses responsible for creating and signing blocks of transactions each time a block is made. The first 19 are voted for, as described above. Then there is a 20th witness, which is a random witness who might not have been in the top 19. The 21st witness is a miner doing typical proof-of-work.","In the Steemit white paper, the authors write:","Since catapulting in value to over $400m, Steem has cooled to an approximate market-cap of $157m, but this still makes it one of the six largest cryptocurrencies on the space.","While there are certainly naysayers, the reality is that Steemit continues to see more people signing up and participating.","However, it’s not simply Steemit the social media site, but also the blockchain that has experienced tremendous growth. Scott said that entrepreneurs and developers have already created 50 different tools, such as Catch a Whale (which tracks where whales have recently voted) and SteemMarket (which lets users buy, sell and rent goods with Steem).","Ned said:","Whether they stick around past the excitement, though, remains to be seen.","If the stories of people paying off bills, buying family members washing machines and going on vacations is any indication, Steemit might have found a niche for content creators looking for ways to generate income.","Disclosure: The author posted several articles on Steemit in conjunction with writing the report, for which he earned $2,400 in Steem.","Social media hero image via Shutterstock"],"create_date":"2016-08-13T14:43:39Z","tag":"Technology, Altcoins, Social Media, Steemit, Features, other-public-protocols, Technology News","author":"Jacob Donnelly"},{"url":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/27/german-government-relieves-capital-gains-tax-on-bitcoin-positions/","web_url":"https://www.coindesk.com/","type":"article","description":"Bitcoin transactions have been made exempt from capital gains tax after one year in Germany","title":"German government relieves capital gains tax on bitcoin positions","content":["Bitcoin transactions in Germany have been made exempt from capital gains tax after one year.

Many will be glad to see the German federal government clarifying how bitcoins should be treated as an asset.","Die Welt also explained (translated):","","","Legally, the purchase and sale of bitcoin is a private sale transaction under Section 23 paragraph 1 sentence 2 of the Income Tax Act, which (according to section 2, paragraph 1, sentence 1, No. 7 Income Tax Act) is classed as income tax. The legal requirement is to collect on these transactions only if the period \"between buying and selling is no longer than one year.\" Bitcoins are enjoying increasing popularity in the Internet community, but also as a playground for speculators. They allow for the payment of goods and services on the Internet without the need for a traditional bank account or a credit card.

However, if German people see bitcoin as a realistic way in which to store their money, that could in turn promote its adoption.","As long as someone can prove they have held a certain balance for at least a year, subsequent purchases and withdrawals of the digital currency will be tax-free, as long as they don\u0027t exceed the balance of a year ago.","It is also worth noting that the German capital gains tax does not apply to mining bitcoins. It only applies to stocks, bonds, etc, that have been purchased with the intention of market speculation.

Rent-seeking tokens, where you can remove the token and the network will be better off, and non-rent seeking tokens, where you remove the token and it doesn\u0027t work,\" he said, adding:","In interview, Pantera further opened up about how it would seek to inject its capital in the market, comments that shed light on how its movements could impact the day-to-day holdings of retail investors who may also be seeking exposure to crypto assets.","In this way, Morehead said that the market shouldn\u0027t expect Pantera to be frequently entering and exiting deals, though he said the fund would take steps to preserve its profitability and maximize opportunity if warranted.","\"We\u0027re going to make relative value judgements. If the token has reached a fair value and there\u0027s a new token that\u0027s inexpensive, we would trade,\" he said. \"But, we\u0027re investing in tokens, we\u0027re not making markets.\"","Krug also explained a bit about how it will seek to make technical evaluations on the prospects of various projects, evaluating the technical foundations of the designs of proposed protocols, as well as the strength of the team.","It\u0027s worth noting that investing in ICOs is still an inexact science, as, owing to the difficulty of changing blockchain infrastructure protocols, its unknown whether pivoting will be as easy for entrepreneurs building on top of the tech.","That\u0027s where Pantera is hoping Krug\u0027s experience will pay dividends.","Augur raised $5.3m in an ICO for its ethereum-based prediction market platform in 2015 through the sale of tokens that power its reputation system. Today, its network is valued at $305m, with tokens trading for $27 at press time, according to data from Coinmarketcap.","Also discussed was the rapid escalation in value observed in the total cryptocurrency market, which surpassed $100bn earlier this year, up from $18bn on 1st January, and the effect of what some have called a \"bubble\" forming in the market.","Still, Krug sought to take a more long-term view, asserting that despite short-term fluctuations, he\u0027s confident that the ICO process will emerge as a compelling way to fund protocol development, one that will continue to interest investors and entrepreneurs.","\"In the long term, we\u0027re at the very beginning,\" he remarked.","Likewise, Morehead said that, as with its bitcoin fund, the ICO fund is likely to see ups and downs. Overall, he focused on the fact that the funds would expand Pantera\u0027s investment capabilities while helping to fund and fuel growth in the market.","Krug concluded:","Coin collection via Shutterstock"],"create_date":"2017-06-28T16:59:51Z","tag":"startups, News, Markets, ICOs, Pantera Capital, other-public-protocols, business news, Markets News","author":"Pete Rizzo"},{"url":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/06/21/armed-with-an-ethereum-ico-can-kik-succeed-where-facebook-failed/","web_url":"https://www.coindesk.com/","type":"article","description":"Social media platform Kik opens up about its plans to launch a cryptocurrency, saying the move could fulfill long-held business goals.","title":"Armed with an Ethereum ICO, Can Kik Succeed Where Facebook Failed? - CoinDesk","content":["Social media network Kik is on the verge of launching its own ethereum ICO, making it the first mainstream social network to feature cryptocurrency as a core component of its services.","With more than $100m in venture capital invested so far in the company, and what they claim is 15 million monthly active users, the social network that made a name for itself by incentivizing interactions with a points system seems ripe for cryptocurrency adoption.","But this is not the first time someone has come up with the idea, and in spite of what appears to be an impressive number of users, this is still a significant decline from just a couple years ago when it had a reported a total of 200 million registered users.","Among the failed past attempts at similar efforts are no less than Facebook itself, which in 2013 unceremoniously shuttered its own Facebook Credits program after less than two years in existence.","Mindful of the obstacles to changing user behavior, Kik CEO and co-founder Ted Livingston initiated a 2.5-year experiment, called Kik Points, to learn if his social media followers would transact where so many others proved unwilling.","Following the publication of the trial results last month, Livingston explained to CoinDesk why the lessons learned from that data will finally set the stage for the successful integration of social media with cryptocurrency.","The CEO said:","Founded in 2009, Canada-based Kik raised $120m venture capital from investors including Union Square Ventures, RRE Ventures and others, with then-partner Adam Ludwin of Chain at one time joining as an advisor.","As early as 2011, Livingston said Kik was interested in the potential to use a cryptocurrency to \"monetize the consumer community\" without having to force advertisements onto their page or sell virtual goods, both of which they have done in the past.","To test the theory, the startup launched Kik Points in 2014 to measure the demand for a product that lets users charge each other for basic services and to learn more about how those users conduct such transactions.","The published results of the test, which concluded in 2016, shows that Kik users completed 253 million offers for points for doing tasks such as viewing ads, and spent those points on 74 million purchases. On average, 300,000 transactions were conducted per day, with a peak of 2.6m transactions.","\"There were two things it was meant to test,\" said Livingston. \"One is, could digital currency be used to incentivize opt-in advertising? Two is, could we use a digital currency to build an economy? We were trying to test those two things at the same time. What we found it\u0027s yes to both.\"","The main differences between Kik Points and Kin are that the tokens are capped, helping to minimize the potential impact of inflation. Additionally, the use of ethereum\u0027s ERC-20 standard means the tokens can be removed from the Kik ecosystem and spent, or traded elsewhere, and eventually cashed out for fiat currency.","In spite of user behavior that seems to support the willingness to use a cryptocurrency-like system, history is in many ways still stacked against Kik.","In September 2013, when Facebook shuttered its Credits program, the social network already had monthly active users including 874 million people, according to a report by The Next Web. That’s about 1,650% more than Kik currently has.","Also, in a 2012 blog post, the director of Facebook\u0027s project management cited the simplified \"purchase experience\" of using fiat currencies and the increased use of native virtual currencies in Facebook games as contributing factors to the decision to shutter Credits.","While Facebook\u0027s difficulties integrating a native currency into a social network are certainly the highest profile, it is not alone.","After raising over $1m back in 2015 to create a bitcoin-based incentivization token for sending social media messages, GetGems has seemingly disappeared, with its most recent Skype group chat dating back to July 2016.","However, a lot has changed since those earlier attempts to merge social media and a native currency.","Kik’s native currency, Kin, is being built in accordance with the relatively new ERC-20 standard that has helped lead to more than $300m being raised in cryptocurrency via ICOs this year alone.","Also since those early days, companies like Zcash and Ripple have innovated by setting aside a percentage of the total tokens for their own uses – a practice Kik intends to follow.","In this case, Livingston said Kik will hold for its own purposes 30% of the total tokens that will ever circulate.","Perhaps nothing demonstrates the new context more that the fact that, the month Facebook shuttered its Credits service, bitcoin\u0027s market cap was about $1.6bn and ethereum didn\u0027t exist. Now bitcoin is valued about $44bn and ethereum at $33bn.","While Livingston didn’t reveal the current finances of Kik, he emphasized that he hopes the currency will further align the interests of his users and the company, who he says both want to see the products they create generate revenue.","Livingston concluded:","Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which has an ownership stake in Chain.","Editor\u0027s Note: This article originally stated Kik has 50m monthly active users.

But behind the scenes, plenty of game-changing work is being done as well, such as developers working diligently to make Bitcoin a better payment system.","Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, which boosts Bitcoin payment’s speed and allows many, many more users the opportunity to send Bitcoin payments, is giving Bitcoin at least an inkling of a shot at mass adoption. And in 2021, as in every other year since the white paper was released in 2015, Lightning Network developers have been tinkering to make the technology more usable for more people.","Read the CoinDesk Research report: A Deep Dive Into Lightning as a Bitcoin Scaling Solution","With the help of this background grind, the network is swelling in use. The Lightning Network reeled in a record amount of bitcoin being used on the network. Twitter is even testing the technology to allow its users to send bitcoin tips to each other.","All that said, there’s still a lot of work to do to make the payment network easier to use, more secure and more private.","This is not an exhaustive list, since so much work is being poured into the technology, but here are a few key Lightning protocol developments that made headway this year.","This year, Lightning got a huge boost from the November activation of Taproot, the biggest change to Bitcoin in four years. Taproot’s addition of Schnorr signatures makes it possible to add new privacy improvements to Lightning.","Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack","But there’s still a lot of work ahead to make these privacy improvements a reality.","“While Taproot brings many privacy improvements to the table, there are a lot of other, unrelated updates to Lightning that are higher priority and orthogonal to it, and implementers are already struggling to find time to review and implement everything. Please be patient, Taproot is coming, but it will take time!” Lightning Network developer Bastien Teinturier writes.","That said, there are a few key ways Taproot can affect Lightning at various levels.","Bitcoin is abnormally transparent. All transactions are stored on a ledger, which anyone can easily browse through. Today, it’s generally easy to distinguish Lightning transactions from normal transactions, because the address format is a little different.","Taproot makes it possible (for the most part) to make Lightning transactions look indistinguishable from normal transactions, making it much less clear that the user is using the Lightning Network for their transactions.","Taproot could also pave the way for “Point Lock Time Contracts” (PTLCs). In short, the Lightning Network connects nodes from around the world, allowing payments to find a “path” across this network, hopping across several connected nodes. The beauty of PTLCs is they make it much harder for someone trying to trace a payment’s origin to link these various hops, shielding the path where a payment came from.","Even though there’s still a lot to do, it was a big step in 2021 to push Taproot through, making these changes possible.","One huge problem with the Lightning Network is inbound liquidity.","Read more: Lightning Network’s New Liquidity Marketplace Attracts a ‘Surprising’ Mix of Individuals, Enterprises","In order to receive money on Lightning, users need to either spend money first or find some other way of obtaining “inbound liquidity.” This is super confusing to newer users who just want to accept payments easily.","Developers have been cooking up different ways to make it easier to find and snag the required liquidity. In 2021, a number of tools emerged for dealing with this issue.","At the end of 2020, Lightning Labs introduced Pool, a marketplace for buying and selling this essential liquidity, giving developers a better interface for tracking it down. In 2021, Lightning Labs also unveiled “sidecar channels,” an easy way to also use the marketplace to help others get inbound liquidity easily – for a fee.","Additionally, Bitcoin tech startup Blockstream opened the first dual-funded channel on mainnet in May.","Without going into too much detail, the Lightning Network is composed of pathways called “channels” that are kind of like a bank account allowing users to send Lightning transactions. A Lightning channel is composed of two parties. Usually when such a channel is opened, only one side has funds. Dual-funded channels allow for both sides to add funds to the channel, opening up a way for both channel parties to be able to send and receive payments over the network immediately.","This year, Blockstream also introduced liquidity ads, which offer some of the same benefits as Lightning Labs’ Pool, but without a central middleman managing the infrastructure. Instead, liquidity ads bake in a way to advertise liquidity into the Lightning protocol. Nodes that are buying or selling liquidity can post advertisements that get relayed to the other nodes in the network in a decentralized marketplace.","Another proposal in the works for the Lightning Network is paying fees when “closing” a channel. A user has to set an initial closing fee when they open the channel. But Bitcoin fees can fluctuate wildly. So, the fee a user decides to pay today could be too big or small for a transaction that closes, say, a year from now.","“Anchor outputs” is a feature concocted to make it possible to bump up such a fee. The Lightning Network’s three leading code implementations LND, C-lightning and Eclair all implemented anchor outputs in some form in 2021.","But even anchor inputs don’t solve the whole problem of closing fees. When a Lightning Network’s closing transaction fee gets bumped up, there’s a possible security issue. By way of a fee-bumping technique known as “Child Pays For Parent” (CPFP), a so-called “child” transaction pays too little for a fee, and so a “parent” transaction spends the same coins as the child it’s referring to, bumping up the fee. There’s a possible issue where, even if users try to bump up the fee, nodes might ignore the transaction if the parent transaction’s fee is still too small. In that scenario, the fee is not successfully bumped up, meaning the transaction doesn’t go through as fast as the user needs it to.","Package relay, a project steered by Bitcoin Core contributor Gloria Zhao, offers a way to get around this problem by packaging the parent and child transactions together, ensuring that these fee-bumping transactions are not ignored. The feature made a lot of progress this year, though it is not yet fully merged into the code base.","The way Lightning payments are usually accepted is with an invoice – usually in the form of a QR code, the square-shaped barcode that can be scanned with a phone. It outlines the payment destination and amount of BTC to send. However, this invoice can be used only once. Thus, every time you want to receive a new Lightning transaction, you need to generate a new invoice. .","This is a different transaction flow than the one users experience on Bitcoin’s main chain, where they can post a static Bitcoin address to collect donations, for example. (Note: Address reuse is generally discouraged for privacy-related reasons.)","For the last couple of years, the ad hoc standard LNURL has offered a way around this issue so that a user could accept multiple payments using the same Lightning invoice.","But this year another proposal gained steam . It’s known as “offers,” championed by Blockstream Lightning developer Rusty Russell and standardized in BOLT 12. Developers disagree whether offers or LNURL is a better solution. One reason Russell is pushing for offers is that it potentially offers better privacy.","The proposal has gathered a lot of support. In addition to allowing multiple payments to the same address or QR code, offers will introduce a way to send recurring payments over the Lightning Network, such as a monthly payment to Netflix.","“[Offers] has seen a lot of progress and is a great improvement for the payment UX (user experience). I’m hoping that it will start being deployed in early 2022,” Teinturier told CoinDesk.","C-lightning offers experimental support of offers. The project still needs to be standardized across the different Lightning implementations.","Another issue is the reliability of Lightning payments. Payments don’t always go through properly, especially if they’re larger payments. Lightning researchers Rene Pickhardt and Stefan Richter published a paper describing a nifty new routing method that could improve reliability of Lightning payments.","In short, a Lightning payment needs to bounce across multiple nodes in order to reach its destination, such as a merchant who accepts Lightning payments for a cup of coffee. Because these hops have some privacy built in, the balance distribution of the channels is hidden. Therefore, it can be tricky to find a path that has enough capacity in it to support the payment all the way – especially for larger payments. The average Lightning channel capacity is currently around $2,033, meaning if you want to send payments above that amount, it will be more difficult to find a consistent path across the network.","Today, the algorithm in Lightning focuses on finding the cheapest route for the user in terms of fees. But while this is good from the perspective of finding cheap channels, it’s more likely to pick a path that fails. Pickhardt and Richter take another approach: They look at the probability a payment will succeed based on the size of the channels in the path, while also considering the cheapest options in terms of fees.","C-lightning has implemented an experimental first version of the new routing mechanism, which has successfully routed payments more reliably, as the authors of the paper hypothesized.","With all these changes in the mix, Lightning is growing easier to use, as well as more reliable and private. In 2022, Lightning developers are looking to build upon these changes in the hopes that they trickle down to help everyday Lightning payment users."],"create_date":"2021-12-28T14:16:16.059Z","tag":"Bitcoin, Lightning Network, Payment Channels, Technology","author":"Alyssa Hertig"},{"url":"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/20/who-is-building-ethereums-public-goods/","web_url":"https://www.coindesk.com/","type":"article","description":"The aim of Web3 isn’t exploitation, but \"regeneration\" of nonstate and noncorporate infrastructure.","title":"Who Is Building Ethereum\u0027s Public Goods?","content":["I dislike conferences. I’m awkward, almost comically introverted and pathologically incapable of striking up a conversation with strangers (sober). It’s an ordeal. My recent decision to attend ETHBarcelona overrode these factors because my intuition told me this was a statement conference about what I recently termed “hyperregen.”","I had to attend. I needed to confirm whether I was imagining this trend or whether it was really there, something you could recognize in the faces of the attendees, raw and uncensored. Not just part of the memetics of Crypto Twitter.","Paul Dylan-Ennis is a lecturer/assistant professor in the College of Business, University College Dublin.","Hyperregen is my term for an emerging and overarching metanarrative of contemporary Ethereum culture. It names the trend, evident in the past year or two, where Ethereum-based projects and influencers more and more present themselves as advancing a regeneration of culture, art and economics.","In many ways, hyperregen is a response to the market nihilism of “DeFi degens,” but also a response to a broader existential crisis that can afflict people operating in crypto, asking is it really just about the money?","If the answer to “what is Ethereum?” is profit, then we have engaged in an elaborate reproduction of late-stage neoliberal capitalism but with fewer safeguards for retail investors. You might say, crypto degens have been speedrunning the history of finance – finding they’re Lehman Brothers circa 2008.","See also: The One Word That Defines Ethereum\u0027s Goals | Paul Dylan-Ennis","ETHBarcelona challenged this and felt like a claim that the real purpose of Ethereum is to act as a laboratory for a broader political project and site of economic experimentation. Although pro-markets, the aim of Web3 isn’t exploitation, but regeneration.","That may explain why so many people who were there were “solarpunks.” What started as a literary genre has been adopted by the hyperregen culture and transformed into an implicative aesthetic. Solarpunks dream of a future that has seamlessly integrated highly advanced technology with lush greenery, a Heaven on Earth.","Presenters discussed Ethereum as a type of shared commons. It’s a space where people can coordinate activities to build large, open systems. You could describe this vision as a type of experimental solarpunk “minarchism,” or a variation of libertarianism that wants most things run by communities and outside control of the state.","In Ethereum hyperregen culture, minarchism comes in the form of an alternative, decentralized mechanism of public goods funding, so that we don’t have to be reliant on governments or corporations.","Griff Green, founder of decentralized charity platform Giveth, argued the state justifies its negatives (surveillance, overtaxation, etc.) with its positives (roads, parks, etc.). Crypto’s hyperregen tactic is to wither away the state’s stranglehold on the positives until all that is left is the negative, undercutting any justification for the existence of the state at all.","This is a deeply agorist position in the style of Samuel Konkin III, who advocated for the parallel creation of left libertarian enclaves that compete with the state, eroding its contiguous territory until the state evaporates.","Like Konkin, hyperregen is acutely aware that a post-state world cannot be achieved with a right libertarian mindset because the free-rider problem ensures necessary public goods go unprovided or neglected. In Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s words:","“Given that a purist ‘private property rights only’ libertarianism inevitably runs into large problems like its inability to fund public goods, any successful pro-freedom program in the 21st century has to be a hybrid containing at least one Big Compromise Idea that solves at least 80% of the problems, so that independent individual initiative can take care of the rest.”","My impression at ETHBarcelona is that the Big Compromise Idea is the climate crisis. The solution, as I took it, is that skeptics of collective solutions, like those required for climate change, could be swayed by the effectiveness of decentralized solarpunk coordination.","This is what Konkin suggested as an agorist tactic: You don’t wait for permission, but permissionlessly build the alternative in parallel and through your constructions reveal the attraction of the post-state alternative.","Easily the most advanced thinking on solarpunk coordination comes from Scott Moore, the founder of Web3 funding vehicle Gitcoin. Moore argues not necessarily against traditional states or corporations but the idea that they represent the only coordination mechanisms for shared social problems.","See also: Ethereum\u0027s Political Philosophy Explained | Paul Dylan-Ennis","Instead, we should recognize our already-existing coordination tooling (quadratic funding, retroactive public goods funding, multisigs, etc.) and incentivization mechanisms (currencies, tokens, soulbound tokens, airdrops, etc.) are examples of successful economic, social and political organization at local scale that can be scaled up.","In both Green and Moore, the meta-argument is agorist: to not just generate positive externalities beyond Ethereum but begin organizing beyond Ethereum itself.","Finally, the “lunarpunk” tendency, represented (all-too) briefly at ETHBarcelona by Amir Taaki, argues that whatever direction we are heading, anonymity must be embedded into our practices.","Right after Taaki’s talk, a panel of EU regulators closed out the event, but I couldn’t help but feel the order here was wrong, giving second billing to a more radical vision.","All in all, it appears the hyperregens are on the ascendent in Ethereum culture."],"create_date":"2022-07-20T15:02:17.217Z","tag":"Opinion, Ethereum, Philosophy, Economics","author":"Paul J.

Unlike the often vague “utility” of ICO tokens that were sold in the billions back in 2017, Braintrust is focused on solving the liquidity problem encountered when establishing two-sided marketplaces.","","","Braintrust’s solution reflects the pooled flexibility and decentralized governance of protocols like Compound Finance, on which some of its software is based.","","","Read more: This Startup Is Forking Compound to Make Hiring More Efficient","","","Stepping back, Braintrust CEO Adam Jackson is a veteran at building two-sided marketplaces, including an e-commerce platform acquired by Intuit, an automotive marketplace acquired by Advanced Autoparts and another called Doctor on Demand. The common denominator is how expensive it can be to build liquidity into these networks in order to make them fly, and the effect this can have further down the line.","","","“The typical playbook from eBay all the way up to the gig economy players we see now, is you raise hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars, and use that money to subsidize one or both sides of the marketplace,” said Jackson. “You’re essentially paying people to show up.”","","","And the way this typically plays out is the investors, who are the owners of the marketplace, sooner or later start taxing the network, turning up the fees. This then starts to erode the network effects of the business, said Jackson, creating divergent incentives between the operators of the service and the people who make a living there.","","","The depressing nadir of this is encapsulated in the iniquities of Uber; the sort of stuff that has effectively lowered the minimum wage in the U.S., said Jackson.","","","“While five guys in San Francisco became deca-billionaires, a third of all Uber drivers live below the poverty line, some of them even live in the cars they drive,” he said. “So I wanted to figure out how we could create a marketplace that is owned and controlled by its users, instead of investors who just want to tax it.”","","","Jackson describes Braintrust as a “labor protocol” in the same way that Ethereum is a smart -contract protocol. As such, it’s more like a non-profit, a kind of public good, he said, upon which other businesses and use cases will flourish, rather like the composability, or the Lego-like functionality of building with DeFi.","","","“Our business model with Braintrust involves lowering the fees to almost zero. We charge talent zero; we charge clients 10%, that’s just meant to kind of pay our bills and sustain us,” Jackson said. “By lowering fees to zero, you enable a whole new class of big transactions that could never touch a place like Upwork, because the fees are too high.”","","","Likewise, the project’s tokenomics are confined to governance and voting decisions (there will be a free issuance of tokens to Braintrust users in the middle of next year). The tokens are simply a way to get millions of users across the world on the same page because you can’t have someone in Ukraine or in India custody a share of a Delaware C-corp, said Jackson.","","","“A blockchain-secure token is a perfect value-capture incentive and governance instrument to replace a share of stock,” Jackson said. “And when I say replace, I don’t mean a financial token, there’s no dividend.”","","","Once the Braintrust community of freelancers is up and running, they will be able to use their tokens to vote on proposals such as fee levels, categories of work to be added, standards for allowing workers to join and so on.","","","Braintrust’s token voting system is a fork of the governance framework created by DeFi money market Compound Finance, actually using some of the same code. (Compound CEO Robert Leshner is a close ally and advisor to the project.)","","","Jackson pointed out that he started Braintrust well before DeFi was a thing, but said the comparison is apt.","","","“What DeFi figured out was how to use a token as an incentive mechanism to bootstrap liquidity in a two-sided marketplace – DeFi’s lend and borrow,” he said. “We’re doing the same thing, using a token to bootstrap liquidity in a two-sided marketplace. Ours is labor and clients.”","","","Following a two-year incubation and armed with a $6 million seed round, Braintrust’s private beta was just getting off the ground when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.","","","“We thought we were toast,” said Jackson.","","","But after “a terrible few months,” clients started calling back, with more and more large firms accepting that working remotely was becoming the norm. “So that has become a big tailwind,” Jackson said. “Our Q3 was two times our pre-COVID financial plan for marketplace transactions and that has brought us to this fundraising round we are announcing.”","","","In terms of numbers, Jackson said Braintrust currently has several thousand testnet token holders and a waitlist of 40,000 for when the service goes public next year.

Olson is the head of the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS that represents taxpayers.","Olson singled out a lack of IRS guidance around bitcoin and other virtual currencies as a particular issue of concern in this year\u0027s report, listing it in the \"most serious problems\" section.","The National Taxpayer Advocate had already asked for tax guidance in 2008. The IRS had begun assessing tax compliance risks from virtual economies in 2007, and published information on its website on the tax implications of virtual economy transactions in 2009. This advice didn\u0027t specifically cover digital currencies, however.","A gap in specific guidance from the IRS on bitcoin and other digital currency has left individuals and businesses scouring the Internet for often inaccurate information, Olson warned, adding that many would be surprised to hear that capital gains could be imposed on bitcoins.","Olson identified several issues needing firm guidance from the IRS. Existing tax forms require US citizens and residents to report foreign accounts holding more than $10,000, for example. It is unclear whether this includes bitcoin.","Coinbase, which provides payment processing services for vendors, failed to respond immediately to questions about its compliance with that form, entitled Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR), but rival payment processor BitPay confirmed that it did list compliance with the form in its merchant terms and conditions.","Olsen also highlighted state tax law as a potential future challenge. Several state-level bills would force out-of-state vendors to collect sales tax on sales to in-state residents. \"These bills only provide full sales tax collection when the seller knows the purchaser\u0027s address,\" the report said. That is naturally a problem for bitcoin-enabled vendors, who may not have that information. \"For all these reasons, bitcoins could become more popular as a result of this legislation,\" said Olson.","Senator Tom Carper, who has been outspoken about bitcoin’s potential as recently as this week, praised Olson’s comments on bitcoin and tax guidance.","“I believe that the vast majority of these consumers want to play by the rules and do the right thing when it comes to complying with federal tax law as it pertains to digital currencies, but they can\u0027t do that until the Internal Revenue Service does its job and issues the rules of the road that all must abide by,” he said.","“I am hopeful that the new Internal Revenue Service Commissioner, John Koskinen, takes these recommendations to heart and acts expeditiously to provide thoughtful guidance to taxpayers regarding the use of digital currencies.”","This isn\u0027t the first time that the IRS has been accused of dragging its feet on digital currency taxation guidance. Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report recommending informal guidance to at least give the public some information about how to report bitcoin income. At the time, the GAO’s director of tax issues James White told CoinDesk that the IRS was \"running to keep up\".","The IRS has so far given no specific date for further guidance on the taxation of digital currencies, but has indicated that it is working on the topic.","Tax image via Shutterstock"],"create_date":"2014-01-10T00:56:29Z","tag":"Tax, IRS, Regulation, News","author":"Danny Bradbury"},{"url":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/09/worlds-first-insured-bitcoin-storage-service-launches-in-the-uk/","web_url":"https://www.coindesk.com/","type":"article","description":"The world\u0027s first insured bitcoin storage service has launched in the UK, with Lloyd\u0027s of London as its underwriter.","title":"World\u0027s First Insured Bitcoin Storage Service Launches in the UK","content":["The world\u0027s first insured bitcoin storage service has launched in the UK, with insurance underwritten by Lloyd\u0027s of London.","Named Elliptic Vault, the service uses advanced “deep cold storage” techniques to secure its customers’ bitcoins. Deep cold storage involves the use of both strong encryption and secure physical locations.","Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, which is based in London, said:","Within the past week, the price of bitcoin peaked at over $1,020. Given that the price was only £125 just three months ago, many people have amassed something of a bitcoin fortune.","Unfortunately, there have been a number of instances recently of people losing their bitcoins, either due to human error, or the interference of criminals.","In November, for example, James Howells from Wales realised he had sent $6.5m worth of bitcoins to landfill after throwing out a computer hardrive that contained the wallet files and private keys required to access his coins.","[post-quote]","Other bitcoiners have seen their digital currency hoards disappear due to hackers breaking into the wallet services they use. In early November, Inputs.io suffered two hacks, which saw 4,100 BTC emptied from user wallets. Following such developments, many people are anxious to find somewhere secure to store their bitcoins.","\"We know a lot of people are concerned about the security of their bitcoin holdings,\" said Robinson. \"We are providing a service that will give people peace of mind that their bitcoins are safe and secure,\" he added.","Currently, the service is aimed at those with a relatively large collection of bitcoins, with the minimum level of cover set at £5,000. However, Robinson said his company is aiming to reduce this as the product evolves.","Robinson said that, as a bitcoin company, Elliptic found it difficult to find an insurance underwriter to work with.","\"Insurance is a conservative industry, where relationships matter. It took a lot of time, but we are now working with an underwriter that understands and is comfortable with bitcoin,\" he explained.","Lloyd\u0027s of London is a UK-based corporate body that was founded in 1688.

Users pay an annual rate of 2%, which is paid in bitcoin, in monthly instalments at the end of each month.","The insurance offered covers loss of bitcoins, whether caused by any negligence by Elliptic or due to theft by a third party.","If users have to make a claim, their bitcoins would be valued at the time of the claim, using the BTC/USD exchange rate on Bitstamp, and the GBP/USD exchange rate. Elliptic said it uses the BTC/USD exchange rate (rather than BTC/GBP), as the US bitcoin exchange market is the most liquid.","Robinson worked for some time on UK-based virtual currency exchange BitPrice, but was unable to bring the company to launch due to difficulties on finding a UK banking partner willing to go anywhere near a bitcoin exchange.","He has now changed the business model and rebranded the company as Elliptic. Elliptic Vault is the company\u0027s first product, but it hopes to expand to offer a number of virtual currency-related services.","A statement on the Elliptic site reads:","","","Together with the digital currency community we continue to actively work with regulators and government, to ensure a sustainable future for digital currencies, both in the UK and globally.\"","Robinson said he wants to create a \"suite\" of services that make digital currencies easier to use, more secure and more powerful.","This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of Elliptic Vault, please do your own research before considering investing any funds in this service."],"create_date":"2014-01-09T15:27:51Z","tag":"Security, Bitprice, startups, Elliptic, Insurance, Wallets, Bitcoin, News, Companies","author":"Emily Spaven"},{"url":"https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/20/coindesks-major-award-is-a-huge-moment-for-us-and-crypto-media-generally/","web_url":"https://www.coindesk.com/","type":"article","description":"Of all the tasks I have in this job, this one has to be the best.","title":"CoinDesk\u0027s Major Award Is a Huge Moment for Us and Crypto Media Generally","content":["The news that Ian Allison and Tracy Wang are joint recipients of a Polk Award, one of the most prestigious in journalism, for three November scoops that led to the unraveling of FTX’s empire is a source of immense pride for all of us at CoinDesk.","This is a milestone, not only for CoinDesk, but for crypto media generally. It underscores the role that sound, professional journalism can play in bringing transparency to the too-often-opaque and, sadly, scam-ridden crypto industry.","As Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker and Executive Editor Marc Hochstein put it in their write-up of the three award-winning stories (Ian’s initial scoop on Alameda’s balance sheet, his followup on Binance being likely to withdraw its bailout and Tracy’s bombshell on CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s “cabal of roommates” that ran FTX): “There is little precedent in journalism history for a story that made such an impact and did it so quickly.”","It’s painful to see so many FTX victims in the fallout from what Ian and Tracy uncovered. But the reality is it would have eventually been exposed. That it wasn’t earlier is, in fact, the problem. It’s why a professional, independent media is vital for an industry with trust issues.","But it takes a technical grounding to cover this complex topic properly. Just as bankers exploited miscomprehension of collateralized debt obligations pre-2008, crypto scammers hide behind techno-fog. That can be challenging for reporters unfamiliar with the tech. It’s why some mainstream coverage of Bankman-Fried left a lot to be desired.","Here, CoinDesk is unique. Sure, there are quality crypto reporters in mainstream media as well as in the crypto press, but no outlet has nearly as deep a bench as we do. We combine the best of mainstream and crypto journalism.","We are led by Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds in editorial, who had a storied 23-year career at Bloomberg, and by Joanne Po, executive producer and head of multimedia, who led TV and digital multimedia teams at CNBC, The Wall Street Journal and Fox Digital. We have other senior editors with decades of newsroom experience. Just as importantly, we employ many scoop-hungry, crypto-native reporters – some of them straight out of school, others older – with deep, personal understanding of the technology and its opportunities and challenges.","This two-way approach is more important than ever. Contrary to its critics, crypto isn’t going anywhere. But, clearly, it needs to be improved, both on the technical side and in the regulatory framework. If it is to live up to its transformative potential, it’s vital that crypto’s problems be exposed, so that solutions can be iteratively developed and so that promising projects are given the attention they deserve.","It has become popular in some crypto circles to argue that this should be left to solo “citizen journalists” on Twitter. But while there’s definitely a place for the crowdsourcing of information that happens on social media, Ian and Tracy’s work is Exhibit A in the case for why independent, structured press organizations like CoinDesk remain vital.","Until someone comes up with something better – perhaps, one day, a workable, trusted decentralized system for uncovering facts and holding bad actors accountable – there’s no substitute for the training or the embedded principles of professional journalism with which reporters develop trust with sources, report accurately and work with integrity.","Do we occasionally get things wrong? Sure. But there’s a commitment, day in and day out, to endeavor to get it right, promptly correct and disclose our mistakes and strive for objectivity and transparency. The best way to address the conspiracy theorists who blindly claim we serve some puppet master’s interests is to point to the proof in our pudding.","Today is therefore not only a day to celebrate Ian and Tracy and their editor, Nick Baker, but every single person at CoinDesk. They have all contributed to a workplace that allows and encourages our journalists to pursue these high standards – one result of which is this highly deserved accolade. It’s a day, also, to recognize why it’s so important that the wider crypto industry supports media institutions like CoinDesk that live by these principles."],"create_date":"2023-02-20T15:15:43.271Z","tag":"CoinDesk, Journalism, Opinion","author":"Michael J.

But how?","title":"Bitcoin Holders Face Uncertainty Over Tax Returns","content":["","This financial year is the first in which many bitcoin users will consider putting their cryptocurrency gains on their tax returns.","","","When a bitcoin was worth $5 or less, most people didn’t make enough money on them to worry about taxes. But 2013’s price run-up pushed plenty of bitcoiners into a category where unreported gains could attract attention – and possible sanctions – from the US Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.","","","Some will quietly pocket those earnings, tax free, hoping that bitcoin’s anonymity will keep the government bean counters from their doorstep. But others are grappling with how to report their gains to tax authorities who, in the United States and most countries, have provided little to no guidance on how to do that.","","","One Washington State programmer walked into his local H\u0026R Block for help reporting $77,000 in gains from mining and trading in bitcoins and litecoins. The accountant there turned him away.","","","“Midway through explaining how mining is really part of the issuance of the currency, he sort of just glossed over,” the programmer posted on reddit.","","","The main questions plaguing would-be cryptocurrency taxpayers are how to categorize bitcoin gains or losses, and what events are taxable.","","","Most experts expect that the IRS will treat bitcoins as either a foreign currency, or, more likely, a capital asset or investment. Some events are clearly taxable, like selling bitcoins for US dollars, whereas others might be taxable depending on one’s interpretation of existing regulations that were not written with cryptocurrency in mind.","","","Even tax professionals who want to report their own bitcoin gains are struggling to figure out how to do it properly. Cryptocurrency miners, who invest in high-end computers to process transactions on the block chain and are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins, face some of the most difficult questions.","","","“It’s not that easy to understand,” said Yana Kesler, a certified public accountant from Philadelphia, who bought a $7,200 mining rig with her husband last year, spent $2,200 for hosting services and generated about 50 bitcoins. She then needed to decide how to report the income and how to deduct the expenses. Was this activity a business? An investment? A hobby?","","","“Usually a business is something you participate in,” Kesler reasoned, while mining seems more like a “passive investment”.","","","Tyson Cross is a San Diego tax attorney who plans to help a handful of clients file tax returns involving bitcoins this year. Cross addresses how to report mining income and other bitcoin tax questions on his website, Bitcoin Tax Solutions. He said:","","","“Nothing’s ever existed like bitcoin mining. It’s a completely unique activity. You can try your best to fit it into existing laws, but anyone’s guess is as good as someone else’s.”","","","","Like all the quotes from tax experts in this story, Cross’s statements should not be considered tax advice, which is best sought directly from a qualified professional.","","","Other tough questions include how to figure out the basis, or original cost, of bitcoins that were purchased and later sold at a higher price. Users may not have kept records, especially if they bought their bitcoins early, and didn\u0027t expected them to amount to much.","","","One particularly vexing possibility is that bitcoin users might need to calculate tax owed every time they purchase something with bitcoins. The reason? If you\u0027re shopping with bitcoins that are worth more than they were when you got them, spending those bitcoins could be a taxable event.","","","For instance, if you bought 1 BTC for $100 earlier this year, then used it to buy a computer when the bitcoin price hit $1,000, you could owe tax on the $900 appreciation.","","","“That can come as a surprise to a typical consumer, who may not be accustomed to tracking his basis in currency, or computing gain, or loss in connection with a personal transaction,” wrote Mindi Lowy and Miriam Abraham of PricewaterhouseCoopers in a November report for the publication Tax Notes.","","","Calculating income tax every time you spend bitcoins might not sound like a big deal if you only spend them occasionally. But with more than 1,000 merchants now accepting bitcoins, some people will be making more and more small transactions over the course of a year, presenting an accounting nightmare when tax time comes.","","","When Cross posted an overview of bitcoin tax issues on reddit, this potential problem created a stir. “Some people were alarmed by that. […] It’s a serious problem for the future of bitcoin,” Cross said.","","","As if that were not complicated enough, the Washington State programmer who sought tax advice from H\u0026R Block had another quandary when figuring out taxes due on bitcoin purchases. He ordered some merchandise and paid with 2.6 BTC – worth about $2,500 at the time. He was planning to report the difference between the bitcoins’ value when he acquired them and their higher value when he spent them. But he hit a snag. The programmer told CoinDesk:","","","“I actually have not had the seller for all of the merchandise deliver – and subsequently [they ignored] my attempts at contact – so I\u0027m not sure if I should deduct that fraud from my gains or just leave it all in to be safe.”","","","","Another worry is whether Americans holding bitcoins in foreign-based exchanges might be subject to a law that requires the reporting of foreign bank accounts containing more than $10,000. “I\u0027d be shocked if many people realize that their foreign bitcoin accounts are arguably subject to the reporting requirements,” Cross said.","","","Some reddit members responded to Cross’s post by saying they wouldn’t bother reporting bitcoin gains to the IRS. “After reading all this, all I got was ‘paying taxes on bitcoins is too hard so just don\u0027t worry about it’,” one person wrote.","","","The US Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS), in a recent entreaty to the IRS to issue guidance on bitcoin taxes, had predicted this attitude: “The lack of clear answers to basic questions such as when and how taxpayers should report gains and losses on digital currency transactions probably encourages tax avoidance,” says the TAS 2013 Annual Report to Congress.","","","Since bitcoin wallets have no names attached and bitcoin exchanges do not appear to be reporting transactions to the IRS at this point, non-reporters may just get away with it. Then again, they might not, Cross warned – there are multiple ways in which the government could find out about taxable bitcoin transactions.","","","If a customer transfers a large amount of money from an international bitcoin exchange to a regular bank, for instance, the bank may file a Suspicious Activity Report, which could trigger a government investigation looking for money laundering or other illegal activity.","","","Or someone might “rat you out to the IRS”, Cross warned.","","","“[P]eople get jealous, and if they’ve heard that you’ve made lots of tax free money on bitcoins, they might get tempted to make sure justice is served. There’s also that nice reward the IRS will pay them based on how much money the IRS ultimately recovers from you,” he said.","","","The TAS report stated that “many law-abiding taxpayers want to comply and to distinguish themselves from tax evaders”. Conversations with potential clients led Cross and another tax expert, Carl M Force, to believe that there are plenty other law-abiding bitcoin users out there who want to do the right thing.","","","But not everyone.","","","“Your crooks and drug dealers are not going to comply at all,” said Force, who aside from being a certified public accountant is a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration. “If you’re going to go on Tor, the dark Internet, the people on there are not going to be asking advice on how to file their taxes,” he said.","","","Other bitcoin users may resist reporting their bitcoin gains for more philosophical reasons. One San Francisco entrepreneur told CoinDesk:","","","“I don\u0027t know whether I plan to report them or not. The laws around taxes of bitcoin appears to be unfair and unjust. It\u0027s all complex and seems unnecessary to me.”","","","","On the other hand, some bitcoin enthusiasts want to include bitcoins on their tax returns in order to raise the profile of the growing bitcoin economy with the authorities, and to establish that bitcoin is used by law-abiding citizens – not just drug dealers.","","","“I hope people do report this year. It will show to the government that there is more activity, and maybe they will give better guidance,” said Kesler, who decided to categorize her household’s mining earnings as investment income.","","","A more powerful incentive is fear. People who have realized millions of dollars in unreported gains, or who are prosecuted for holding large amounts of money in unreported overseas accounts, could face stiff penalties or even criminal prosecution.","","","“You’re potentially looking at some serious consequences,” Cross said. “The IRS would love to make a case out of somebody out there and send a message that bitcoin income is taxable.”","","","Whether Americans owe tax on bitcoin gains is not controversial among experts – all agree that bitcoin income is taxable at some point. But there are many ways to approach how to calculate and report those taxes. Cross said:","","","“We don’t have any guidance from the IRS, so every position you take is a gamble. If you’re risk averse, take the most conservative approach, pay more taxes than you possibly should just so you’re safe, and know you can get a refund in the future.”","","","","For those struggling with calculating cost basis and other bitcoin tax mathematics, websites have sprung up to help, such as BitcoinTaxes. Seattle software developer Colin Mackie created the tools on the site to streamline his own tax preparation when he realized that figuring out what he owed on just under $100,000 worth of bitcoin gains was going to be tricky.","","","“Last year, it probably wouldn’t have mattered. This year, there’s enough people noticing,” Mackie said. At that point, he knew he would have to report his bitcoin gains.","","","Businessman image by Shutterstock",""],"create_date":"2014-02-02T12:05:46Z","tag":"Tax, Fraud, IRS, Inland Revenue, Regulation, News","author":"Carrie Kirby"},{"url":"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/20/coindesk-wins-a-polk-award-a-top-journalism-prize-for-explosive-ftx-coverage/","web_url":"https://www.coindesk.com/","type":"article","description":"Three stories were honored, including Ian Allison’s scoop that led to Sam Bankman-Fried’s $32 billion crypto empire collapsing in days.","title":"Crypto News Site CoinDesk Wins Prestigious Polk Award for Sam Bankman-Fried Scoops","content":["CoinDesk journalists won a George Polk Award for the scoop that led to Sam Bankman-Fried’s $32 billion cryptocurrency empire collapsing in days and for two explosive follow-up stories.

It’s vital that it be covered with the kind of probing, well-informed, professional journalism embodied by these two reporters and their attentive, dedicated editors.”","The industry-shaking Nov. 2 story from Allison, a senior reporter, resulted from a source’s tip that Sam Bankman-Fried’s closely held trading firm, Alameda Research, was on shakier financial footing than was generally known.

The article debuted in a world where FTX was fast becoming a household name thanks to a marketing blitz featuring Larry David, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen.","Within days the price of FTT plummeted and Bankman-Fried agreed to a bailout from rival exchange Binance. Almost immediately, Binance got cold feet, as revealed by another Polk-winning scoop from Allison that instantly drove down prices in the entire crypto market. Hours later, Binance confirmed it was backing out of the deal.","Wang, a deputy managing editor, provided the third CoinDesk scoop honored by the Polk Awards: A story revealing that Bankman-Fried and nine co-workers lived together in a luxury Bahamas condominium and at times dated each other while running his companies – including the fact that Bankman-Fried and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison had once been a couple. The piece raised concerns about nepotism, secrecy and conflicts of interest, previewing the tone of a scathing report issued soon after on FTX’s extremely lax administrative procedures.","Nine days after Allison’s initial story, Bankman-Fried’s companies filed for bankruptcy protection. Not long after, Bankman-Fried was arrested and the U.S. Congress held hearings.","There is little precedent in journalism history for a story that made such an impact and did it so quickly. The fallout reverberated throughout the crypto industry and even hurt CoinDesk’s corporate sibling Genesis and parent company Digital Currency Group, underscoring CoinDesk’s editorial independence and dedication to telling important stories.","More than 2,000 news stories have credited CoinDesk for setting off the chain of events, including pieces from high-profile publications like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The Financial Times, The Verge, New York Magazine, CNN and NPR’s “Planet Money” podcast.","“As great an honor as the George Polk award is, I gotta say Ian and Tracy totally deserve it for some of the best journalism it’s been my pleasure to witness,” said Kevin Reynolds, CoinDesk’s editor-in-chief. “They and the work they did are totally awesome.

However, an official Reddit post published Monday warns that “the impact of this combined 1 percent increase was negligible” and further states:","The impact of these fee increases could have far-reaching effects on several applications already leveraging the popular stablecoin for in-house operations.","For example, Gitcoin bounties are frequently denominated and paid out in DAI coins, and entire payment channel platforms – such as the Connext Network that will soon see a mainnet launch on ethereum – leverage DAI as their primary transaction medium.","At present, there are currently over 2 million ether tokens locked in MakerDAO smart contracts, accounting for roughly 2 percent of the total ether supply.","Still, most DAI adoption at the moment is taking the form of a “collateralized debt position,” meaning the user locks three times the amount of ether in a smart contract that they want to withdraw in the dollar-pegged DAI. Then, DAI holders generally liquidate the DAI on external exchanges to pay fiat bills.","The growing popularity of such loans could be a contributing factor to the destabilization of the broader network. In short, it appears organic demand for DAI itself isn’t growing as quickly as demand for loans that have essentially become a fiat off-ramp.","Based on MakerDAO’s data, the gap between DAI holders who sold out their positions and those that return to purchase DAI later that same month (presumably to pay off loans), is widening in 2019.","To be fair, MakerDAO contributors and employees are working to increase demand for the stablecoin beyond the ethereum ecosystem.","Nadia Alvarez, MakerDAO’s business development associate for Latin America, told CoinDesk that crypto-financial service companies now use DAI for backend value transfers. For example, the bitcoin exchange BuenBit and the fiat currency exchange BuenGiro both use DAI for value transfers behind the scenes.","Meanwhile, according to MakerDAO’s own statistics, the majority of new DAI holders spend the stablecoin loot within the first hour of acquiring it, presumably to liquidate the asset.","Plus, the ether collateral in any DAI CDP is automatically liquidated if the ETH price drops below 150 percent, compared to the original 300 percent collateralized. Users are not guaranteed they will get all of their collateral back. Therein lies the contradiction of DAI CDPs.","So far, it’s unclear who is in charge of feeding the price-tracking data into the smart contract.","There are several players in this ecosystem, including the DAI-centric project MakerDAO and the nonprofit MKR Foundation, with a secondary MKR token that grants holders the ability to vote on DAI governance issues.","A MakerDAO spokesperson said the year-old CDP smart contract was written by “Maker developers,” including the project’s “head of Oracles,” Mariano Conti, and has also been used by companies such as Compound Finance and Gnosis.","Without specifying any person or company by name, “for security reasons,” the spokesperson explained that a “decentralized network of Maker employees, community members and people from other projects” queries roughly 14 sources, aggregates their price data and calculates the overall median price of ether.","The spokesperson added that people who hold MKR tokens are the only ones with the power to vote to add or remove data sources. This becomes a crucial focal point as DAI holders grapple with conflicting opinions on whether to increase the DAI treasury\u0027s debt ceiling.","Talk of “liquidating the [ether] collateral” if the broader market drops is a real prospect discussed during public governance meetings, although during the Feb. 28 call Christensen emphasized this consideration is only hypothetical at the moment and the team aims to prevent that type of worst-case scenario.","And, according to a study by the venture capital firm Placeholder, less than 10 percent of MKR token holders participated in the previous vote to raise stability fees to 2 percent.","In order for this stablecoin to survive, it will require a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders. For now, DAI governance is managed by investors who hold the foundation’s MKR tokens, of which 6 percent is owned by Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z fund.","According to Etherscan, the top three MKR accounts hold a combined 55 percent of the tokens, with the largest account alone controlling 27 percent.","After publication of this article, MakerDAO community lead David Utrobin supplied additional information about the top accounts. The wallet with 27 percent is a developer fund, which operates through a multi-signature wallet controlled by the Maker Foundation\u0027s board.","\"This fund is meant to be fully spent within the next few years, fully distributing this large chunk of MKR,\" Utrobin said via email.","A spokesperson for crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital confirmed it owns a “significant portion” of MKR tokens.","Likewise, 1confirmation co-founder Nick Tomanio confirmed his hedge fund is also a significant holder of MKR tokens, adding:","As for the rest of the top 10 holders, their names are not publicly listed. Spokespeople for both ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who owns the ConsenSys conglomerate that incubates MetaMask and GitCoin, and the Ethereum Foundation declined to comment on whether they own significant portions of MKR. Regardless of whether ConsenSys owns MKR, it is undoubtedly a key player pushing for broader retail adoption.","Austin Griffith, director of research at Gitcoin, developed the xDai burner wallet to help users join the system without generating private keys. According to Griffith, simplifying access to that first transaction and denominating value in dollars could make crypto more approachable for people who aren’t already familiar with tokens.","“We’re finally ready to make some of these tradeoffs,\" Griffith said, \"not having to think about .0001 ETH when you can just say you have one DAI and DAI is pegged to a dollar.”","The Maker Foundation, run by MKR token holders, funds the MakerDAO project, which is responsible for maintaining the price-monitoring system that\u0027s referred to as an Oracle.","According to MakerDAO COO Steven Becker, by 2020, DAI users will be able to take dollar-pegged loans leveraging diverse tokens, such as those formerly used by ethereum projects in token sales and invested in heavily by companies like Polychain Capital.","In the meantime, Stephen Palley, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill, told CoinDesk the lack of transparency around the DAI ecosystem and its Oracle could leave room for liability.","\"They are paradoxically creating something that is supposed to be transparent, but basing it on something that they apparently won\u0027t explain,” Palley said. “What assurance is there that liquidations are based on rational, objective, reasonable analysis? I suspect – though I don’t know – that there is an Oz behind the word Oracle. I’d be curious to know who sits behind that curtain.\"","The plan for the revamped Oracle system has DAI users like Richard Burton, CEO of crypto wallet company Balance, feeling bullish. Burton took out a CDP to pay salaries at his startup. Likewise, former SpankChain employee Chelsea Palmer, who was laid off when ether prices tanked, tweeted that she plans to put her remaining ether into DAI CDPs to pay her fiat bills.","Regarding the growing use of CDP loans, Burton told CoinDesk:","Christine Kim contributed reporting.","MakerDAO image via ETHDenver YouTube"],"create_date":"2019-03-05T19:20:38Z","tag":"startups, Ethereum, Stablecoins, MakerDAO, DAI","author":"Leigh Cuen"},{"url":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/04/what-is-so-smart-about-smart-contract-platforms/","web_url":"https://www.coindesk.com/","type":"article","description":"The innovative qualities of Ethereum have led to an explosion of new digital assets in the Smart Contract Platform sector. Here\u0027s a look at the sector, its significance as a digital asset sector and how CoinDesk Indices is setting standards that define this sector.","title":"What Is So Smart About Smart Contract Platforms?","content":["Ether (ETH) is the main token of the Ethereum blockchain and is now the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Just like the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), ether can be used to send payments directly to another person without the need for an intermediary.","The long-term vision for Ethereum is to power more than just financial transactions. Software developers can build applications on Ethereum, ranging from decentralized platforms for lending money to social media networks to develop and exchange content. ETH is unique in its ability to fill the role of a capital asset, consumable/transformable asset, and as a store of value.","The innovative qualities of Ethereum have led to an explosion of new digital assets in the Smart Contract Platform (SCP) sector. This blog post takes a brief look at the Smart Contract Platform sector, its significance as a digital asset sector and how CoinDesk Indices is setting standards that define this sector.","Smart contracts are computerized blockchain protocols that execute terms of a contract. Smart contracts represent computer codes ensuring that when both parties meet the terms of the contract they will execute automatically, allowing for trustless, peer-to-peer transactions. SCP assets are designed for the building of decentralized applications, layer 2 scaling systems, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and other custom protocols.","Every platform has a unique open-source user and miner incentive structure that utilizes the Byzantine Fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism. Every platform also utilizes a native token for the payment towards building on the platform, providing liquidity and allowing interoperability between the native token and the newly created tokens built on the platform.","In December 2021, CoinDesk Indices launched its Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) to set the standard for defining the industries of digital assets. Every one of the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization is assigned to an industry defined by DACS. Then, at least one industry is assigned to an industry group. Finally, at least one industry group is assigned to a sector.","The SCP sector is the second-largest sector in DACS, with 88 assets representing over 35% of the digital asset market worth approximately $750 billion in market capitalization as of March 31, 2022. In addition to the SCP sector, DACS offers five other sectors: Currency, Computing, Culture \u0026 Entertainment, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and Digitization. The six sectors in DACS represent 22 industry groups and 35 industries.","To be assigned to an industry in the SCP sector, the digital asset must be transparent, self-executing and trustless. Smart contract platforms tend to have their own blockchains and consensus mechanisms, but it is disputable how to classify tokens with smart contract capabilities, depending on whether they are used for specific applications or not intended to build dapps (decentralized applications). There are also debates on whether smart contracts need to be decentralized and whether a permissioned blockchain can be classified as smart contract platform.","There are two single-industry groups: Multi-Chain/Parachain and Single Chain.","The Multi-Chain/Parachain industry includes smart contract platform assets that enable multiple parallel blockchains and cross-chain interoperability. The platform can be structured with a relay chain that allows slots for external parallel chains, or parachains.","The Single Chain industry includes layer 1, or base, blockchain in which all transactions are recorded on the primary distributed ledger. The Single chain allows for layer 2, or companion, scaling systems that remain tied to the primary blockchain for transactional competency.","At present, CoinDesk Indices offers two indices based on the SCP sector. The flagship index is the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Index (SCPX) that constitutes a diversified basket of smart contract platform assets with ETH making up 73% of its portfolio from its market cap weighting. However, many investors who already hold ETH do not look for that much exposure to it.","Therefore, the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Ex ETH Index (SCPXX), which is just like SPCX but without ETH, offers flexibility to investors to get exposure to assets in the smart contract platform to complement their existing positions in ETH. Alternatively, SCPXX can be used simply to get exposure to the smaller assets inside the SCP sector. The two, taken together, can be analyzed for insights on performance between ETH and the rest of the sector.","The digital assets in the SCP sector indices are determined by eligibility criteria for investability and liquidity that have the following requirements:","· Ranked in the top 200 of the DACS universe","· Listed on eligible exchanges for at least 30 days","· Supported by eligible custodians","· Market cap is higher than the median of the top 20 eligible assets","· Median daily trading volume over the past 30 days is higher than the median of the top 20 eligible assets","The SCP sector tends to foster a rich environment for innovation that attracts a high level of development and resources. These platforms leverage network effects, decentralized consensus mechanisms and compatibility with various programming languages that enable creative and innovative developers to build protocols for a wide range of purposes such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.","The SCP sector serves as a foundation for the digital economy as the dapps built on these platforms attract numerous users, empowering individuals to take greater ownership over their finances and transactions and creating a burgeoning economy with a wide range of opportunities. They also facilitate a positive reinforcement cycle through the network effect.","The SCPX and SCPXX indices offer investors greater transparency into the sector, offering essential intelligence needed to allow them to express their views by making decisions and executing more efficiently.","To find out more about DACS and its indices, contact us at info@coindesk-indices.com.","Relevant indices","Smart Contract Platform Index (SCPX)","Smart Contract Platform ex-ETH Index (SCPXX)","Index-linked products","Smart Contract Platform ex-ETH Index (SCPXX) underlies the Grayscale® Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund","Disclaimer:","CoinDesk Indices, Inc.

Lubin announced that “ConsenSys 2.0” would seek efficiencies – and a broader reliance on outside partners and investors. “Spinning out” these ventures has gone from an aspiration to a mandate.","“We have been interacting much more with external investors, mostly VCs, over the last nine or 12 months,” Lubin told CoinDesk during an interview in early December. “We’re gonna be ramping that up significantly.”","But even if ether prices recover and ethereum-based tokens come back into vogue across the broader marketplace, former employees and prospective investors tell CoinDesk they worry the road ahead for these projects may be rocky.","Simply put, because of the unusual way ConsenSys structured its investments, it will be hard persuading outsiders to put money into them.","According to six sources familiar with the company’s strategy, ConsenSys often held at least half, if not more, of the equity for each of its \"spokes,\" and Lubin resisted early efforts to seek external investors.","ConsenSys declined to comment on how much equity the company owns in various projects across the conglomerate, but said that \"people who contribute significant value\" to spokes are able to \"develop significant equity\" or \"participate in profit sharing.\"","One former spoke advisor told CoinDesk that ConsenSys previously \"felt uncomfortable owning less than 50 percent of the spoke.\" He added Lubin’s insistence on control, in turn, discouraged other investors from funding these projects, even during the 2017 bull market.","\"A ton of funds and individuals were uncomfortable having Joe on the cap table at all, let alone [with a] controlling stake,\" the advisor said. \"We heard from the occasional group that they would’ve been interested had ConsenSys not been involved.\"","Indeed, one anonymous investor – who is currently in talks with several ConsenSys spokes about potential equity deals – told CoinDesk that these projects will face considerable challenges attracting external investment.","According to this investor, it’s not clear how much equity ConsenSys owns in many of the spokes that the company is trying to “spin out.” In some cases, the startup founders themselves may not know with certainty.","\"You\u0027re effectively investing in Joe Lubin’s company and it’s unclear what his relationship, and what ConsenSys’ relationship, is to that company,\" the investor said. \"You want to invest in a company where the owners and founders are building it, because they are the most motivated.\"","Even at the spokes where ConsenSys is not a major stakeholder, there is still a lack of clarity and uniformity surrounding ownership complicating negotiations as well, the prospective investor said.","The spokes will need to overcome these hurdles to raise capital quickly in order to stay afloat. The prospective investor said:","ConsenSys disagreed in a statement, offering the ConsenSys-incubated company Trustology as an example since it raised capital from Two Sigma Ventures in December. However, given the range of company structures involved with ConsenSys, an incubated company may not face the same challenges as ones that seek to \"spin out.\"","The company appears to be ramping up traditional accelerator programs run by its ConsenSys Ventures arm instead of seeking new projects to fund and then spin out as businesses.","To be clear, “spinning out” is different than layoffs, and Lubin’s team says all spokes have the option to spin out. Still, company representatives tell CoinDesk, \"there will be a number of core projects that will remain internally incubated.\"","Yet one current ConsenSys employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CoinDesk that no one at the company feels secure in their job these days.","He personally expects ConsenSys will be reduced to 200 fintech-focused technologists and consultants – roughly one-sixth of its current size.","An expected 13 percent reduction in staff was announced last month. But it’s difficult to say how many layoffs are yet to come, in the traditional sense, because even beyond “spinning out” many former employees said they worked with short-term or informal contracts.","In a statement emailed to CoinDesk, ConsenSys said that all spokes are being prepped to engage with external investors while ConsenSys itself looks to make \"active seed stage investments\" in new projects.","Meanwhile, Kevin Owocki, co-founder of the ConsenSys spoke GitCoin, told CoinDesk he hopes people will pay more attention to the work ConsenSys spokes are still doing, regardless of staff reductions.","“Clearly it’s a time of contraction right now, but I hope that we can focus on the positive points,” Owocki told CoinDesk. “I’m still very happy with ConsenSys as a backer and I think they’re doing good things for the ecosystem.”","Despite the “crypto winter” impacting the broader ethereum community, Owocki’s 11-person team is still focused on shipping a diverse range of products.","“We didn’t do a token sale. We’ve focused on product traction,” he said. Speaking to the broader ethereum ecosystem, including ConsenSys spokes, he added:","Among its products and services, GitCoin arranges various processes for using cryptocurrency to fund contributions to open source projects. So far, the startup is earning up to $9,000 a month from a tokenized grant product and an advertising system called CodeFund.","With regards to grants, GitCoin has helped distribute more than $738,221 worth of crypto bounties related to hundreds of open source projects. Users include the Ethereum Foundation and other ConsenSys spokes, like the in-browser crypto wallet MetaMask.","Owocki said that the overall platform handles close to $90,000 worth of crypto each month. One of GitCoin’s clients, the stablecoin startup MakerDAO, recently contributed almost 1,000 DAI tokens a month (worth $1,000) to a GitCoin grant for open source contributions to a commissioned project Owocki’s team is also working on, a specialized crypto wallet.","“We’re all working on Ethereum 2.0 as an ecosystem and people need sustainable ways to fund their work,” Owocki said of this grant system, adding he also has high hopes for a subscriptions model that monetizes some GitCoin services.","“I would love to be one of the first staffs that gets to profitability with a subscription model in Web3,” he said, referring to the goal of a decentralized internet.","Owocki admitted these early sources of revenue are not enough to cover his team’s salaries, but said he is not concerned because the team could seek additional venture capital in 2019 if needed. Furthermore, ConsenSys added a statement saying:","Despite the media narrative that some ConsenSys employees weren’t diligently seeking results, former employees said a lack of clarity about decision-making power beyond Lubin was a greater hindrance than any lack of motivation.","One former ConsenSys employee, who tallied income and asked to stay anonymous, told CoinDesk that revenues from some decimated and rearranged spokes “were positive and growing nicely.”","Reassignments started in September, former employees said, and some teams were assured they had plenty of runway just weeks before the layoffs abruptly began. Another former employee, who also asked to stay anonymous, told CoinDesk he was discouraged from critiquing technical solutions because spokes were desperate for clients.","\"You can\u0027t turn to the [spoke] CEO because they have no power,” the former employee said, referring to ConsenSys’ “extremely high” percentage of equity. \"Joe created the company in such a way that no one is able to make decisions without him. No one had the budget.”","While some projects operated with more independence than others, some participants expressed concerns that part of Lubin’s aim for ConsenSys was to boost the value of the ethereum network, which he invested in considerably and is widely believed to own a significant portion of ETH.","A 2018 report by the hedge fund Tetras Capital estimated the ConsenSys INFURA project with centralized servers cost Lubin more than $10 million a year to subsidize infrastructure for many of the ethereum applications that attracted new investors to the ecosystem, even though ethereum\u0027s distributed network wasn\u0027t ready to support high transaction volumes.","Indeed, ConsenSys reps say the company\u0027s early focus was on priming the pump for future advancements:","Yet that may have gone hand-in-hand with other motives. Speaking to how Lubin’s personal net worth and businesses both benefited from soaring ether prices, the former spoke advisor said:","Although it has been a long time since ConsenSys partners and employees were compensated in cryptocurrency, the question for many remains where ConsenSys spokes will go from here, one year into the bear market. Lubin\u0027s team said they are proud of the company\u0027s \"continued commitment to collaborating with others in the space on open, shared infrastructure.\"","Perhaps that\u0027s why the former employee who worked with income statistics told CoinDesk he remains optimistic, adding:","ConsenSys image via CoinDesk archives.

And they said essentially this: It’s a place full of conflicts of interest, nepotism and lack of oversight.","“The whole operation was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas,” a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity.","FTX and Alameda employees CoinDesk interviewed say they have been kept in the dark about the events of the past week, adding that only CEO Bankman-Fried’s inner circle may have had knowledge that the exchange, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, siphoned customer funds into corporate sibling Alameda.","“It’s been radio silence from Sam,” a second Bankman-Fried employee told CoinDesk on Wednesday. “When we saw the CZ [CEO Changpeng Zhao] tweet saying Binance was going to buy FTX, we honestly thought it was fake. But then Sam’s tweet just confirmed it.”","Bankman-Fried finally addressed employees later on Wednesday – a week after a CoinDesk article set the crisis in motion – writing, “I completely understand if you want to step away,” per an internal message to employees viewed by CoinDesk.","Among his nine housemates are FTX co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang, FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and Ellison of Alameda, Bankman-Fried’s trading business that’s at the center of the current chaos and on which the Wall Street Journal reported got $10 billion of FTX customer money. The remaining six are also FTX employees.","“Gary, Nishad and Sam control the code, the exchange\u0027s matching engine and funds,” the first person familiar with the matter said. “If they moved them around or input their own numbers, I\u0027m not sure who would notice.\"","A third person familiar with how the company operated said: “They’ll do anything for each other.”","Bankman-Fried and Ellison did not respond to a request for comment sent directly to them. Wang and Singh could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for FTX was also asked to pass on CoinDesk’s request for comment to Bankman-Fried, Ellison, Wang and Singh.","Bankman-Fried’s father, Stanford Law professor Joseph Bankman, also plays a role at the company. He appeared on an episode of the \"FTX Podcast\" in August, describing charity and regulation-related projects in which he was involved in for the company.","Wang, Singh and Ellison also comprise the board of Bankman-Fried’s FTX Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the company. Several housemates, including Bankman-Fried and Ellison, are active participants in effective altruism, a movement that “aims to find the best ways to help others,” possibly through philanthropy.","In the Bahamas, FTX and Alameda’s offices are also located steps apart in a coworking compound that also housed Solana developers and other crypto incubation projects.","“All of the stakeholders would have a hard look at FTX governance,” tweeted Bankman-Fried on Thursday. “I will not be around if I\u0027m not wanted.”","While some FTX employees have voiced approval for Bankman-Fried’s more frequent communication of late, others are not so consoled.","“Some employees kept their life savings on FTX,” the second anonymous employee told CoinDesk. “We trusted that everything was fine.”","Edited by Nick Baker."],"create_date":"2022-11-10T22:00:00Z","tag":"FTX, Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried, Exclusive , Bahamas","author":"Tracy Wang"},{"url":"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/06/24/this-startup-is-forking-compound-to-make-hiring-more-efficient/","web_url":"https://www.coindesk.com/","type":"article","description":"Braintrust launched out of stealth mode Wednesday, backed by a $6 million seed round featuring True Ventures, Homebrew Ventures, Uprising Ventures, Galaxy Digital, IDEO CoLab, Kindred Ventures and Vy Capital.","title":"This Startup Is Forking Compound to Make Hiring More Efficient - CoinDesk","content":["","A freelance marketplace for sourcing specialized talent is placing its bets on a token to get the dirty work done.","","","Braintrust launched out of stealth mode Wednesday, backed by a $6 million seed round featuring True Ventures, Homebrew Ventures, Uprising Ventures, Galaxy Digital, IDEO CoLab, Kindred Ventures and Vy Capital.","","","The tech startup aims to cut the middleman (think: ZipRecruiter, Indeed) from the employment decision, all using a blockchain – in this case, a fork of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Compound.","","","“In the current environment of massive economic uncertainty, it is our responsibility to share our expertise in managing a distributed workforce, and help businesses supplement their existing teams and continue to innovate in order to get our economy back on track,” Adam Jackson, co-founder and CEO of Braintrust, said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.","","","The round was also joined by a handful of notable angel investors: Adobe CPO Scott Belsky, Compound CEO Robert Leshner, former Instagram CTO (and now Novi VP of engineering) James Everingham and TaskRabbit CEO Stacy Brown Philpot.","","","Braintrust has already sourced hires for firms such as Porsche, Nestle, Blue Cross Blue Shield, TaskRabbit and even NASA.

Unlike a bank, it only borrows and mainly lends cryptocurrency, and it does not have government deposit insurance. The company claims to have gathered a total of more than $1 billion worth of crypto deposits as of June.","As an example of its high lending standards, Mashinsky said Celsius Network strictly demands collateral when making a loan.","“When you’re using any other platforms that are like Celsius, what you care about is, who is the borrower?” Mashinksy said. “Is the lender doing non-collateralized loans? Celsius does not do non-collateralized loans. … Celsius will not do that because that would be taking too much risk on your behalf.”","The statement was at odds with what Celsius’ own representative had told CoinDesk just a few days before.","In response to a question from CoinDesk, Anastasia Golovina, an external spokesperson for Celsius Network at the Ditto PR agency, confirmed the company also makes uncollateralized loans, on what she described as a limited basis.","“Celsius’ total uncollateralized loans are less than a fraction of 1 percent out of tens of thousands of loans issued since 2018,” Golovina told CoinDesk by email on July 13, referring to the number of loans but not the dollar volume. “All of these were normal size loans and were done to institutions with billions of dollars in equity.”","When subsequently asked about the dollar volume of the uncollateralized loans and about Mashinsky\u0027s denial of their existence on the AMA, Golovina did not provide a response.","Read more: Crypto Lending 101","Even if small, the uncollateralized lending is one of several salient items that Celsius has downplayed or not shared with depositors.","Celsius, which has raised close to $20 million in the past two months on the crowdfunding platform BnkTotheFuture (including $10 million from stablecoin issuer Tether), is a major player in a budding corner of the crypto industry.","In the past year, lending activity has mushroomed as some holders sought to earn a yield on their assets, others sought to raise cash without selling their coins and market makers borrowed to fill orders quickly.","The phenomenon could potentially improve liquidity and price discovery for crypto assets. (Disclosure: Another crypto lender, Genesis Capital, is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.)","But like all lending, the crypto kind carries risk – and Celsius may be taking more of it than depositors fully realize.","Whatever the amount of unsecured lending in which Celsius engages, the majority of Celsius’ loans appears to be collateralized. To borrow $1,000 with a 0.7% interest rate, for example, a trader needs to pledge around 0.43 BTC of collateral to Celsius as of this writing, and if the value of that collateral dips, the loan is subject to margin calls.","But Celsius has also at times invested deposits in perpetual swaps, futures-like contracts with no expiry date, people familiar with Celsius’ business said.","Reportedly pioneered by the BitMEX exchange, perpetual swaps settle to an index periodically, letting traders maintain their positions without rolling them over. This activity, one source said, increases Celsius’ vulnerability to brutal sell-offs like the one bitcoin endured in mid-March, which led to a spike in forced unwindings of such contracts at BitMex.","“The problem is that some of that is done on BitMEX, and you take March 12 again and BitMEX closes down through the margin-call floor – the extra 2% profit is now negative 10% profit,” this person said, describing a hypothetical scenario.","Read more: Genesis CEO Details ‘Black Thursday’ Chaos in Q1 Lending Report","Celsius denied investing in perpetual swaps.","“Our business is to lend out coins to institutions,” Mashinsky said in an email to CoinDesk. “Celsius lends mostly to large institutions and sometimes to exchanges, both provide us with collateral.”","A serial entrepreneur who helped pioneer voice-over-internet-protocol (VOIP) technology, Mashinsky founded Celsius in early 2018. Like many in the crypto space, he touts his service as a way to democratize finance. An August 2019 pitch deck obtained by CoinDesk says the company’s vision is to provide “fair interest income for 7 billion people.”","Also potentially concerning to depositors, people with knowledge of the matter said, is that Celsius lends out portions of the collateral borrowers hand over.","An over-the-counter desk trader likened this practice, known as rehypothecation, to the way subprime loans were repackaged and sold as mortgage-backed securities and then resold as collateralized debt obligations in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.","Because of rehypothecation, which the trader said several crypto lending platforms are engaging in, he is seeing many clients pull out of lending and move toward options contracts.","Another source familiar with Celsius’ business said the lender’s rehypothecation of loan collateral is also why crypto miners don’t take out loans from the firm – they don’t want to end up unable to access crypto they mined.","In response to questions about rehypothecation of collateral, Golovina said Celsius won’t “discuss our best business practice and the competitive advantage of our business model.”","Read more: $25 Million in 2 Weeks: BlockFi Booms as Bitcoin and Ether Investors Seek Interest","In its terms of use, Celsius reserves the right to re-hypothecate customers’ assets, but it’s ambiguous whether the passage refers solely to depositors’ funds or to borrowers’ pledged collateral as well. “In consideration for the rewards earned on your Account and the use of our Services,” the document says, “you grant Celsius the right … to pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend or otherwise transfer or use any amount of such Digital Assets … for any period of time.”","Before the aforementioned recent $19.2 million investment from Tether and BnkToTheFuture, Celsius raised its startup capital through an initial coin offering (ICO) in early 2018. The company swapped its CEL token for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the largest and second-largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively.","However, Celsius did not convert the crypto it received in the ICO to fiat until after the market tanked, which caused it to lose about half the value of the proceeds, people familiar with the sale said.","Public information supports this claim. In September 2019, Mashinsky told CoinDesk the ICO was valued at $50 million. But financial statements filed with the U.K. registrar Companies House in May 2020 show proceeds of only $25 million as of Feb. 28, 2019. (Celsius is based in Hoboken, N.J., and privately held, but has a subsidiary in London, and is thus required to file financials with the registrar.)","Celsius chalked up the difference to an accounting practice, but acknowledged it did not convert the crypto to fiat in the same month that it was raised.","“While Celsius reported an ICO worth $50 million, when the coins converted to fiat the value of the coins dropped as the market dropped in accordance,” Golovina said. “In addition, for tax reasons, we recognize revenues over several years as we use the funds to build the product.”","Read more: Here’s Why Interest Rates on Cryptocurrencies Could Be a Game-Changer","Celsius recognizes ICO proceeds as revenue only when it converts the funds to dollars, she said, again citing tax reasons.","It waited to convert the crypto to dollars because the firm identifies as a “HODLer,” she added, using crypto argot for a long-term investor.","CORRECTION (July 29, 20:20 UTC): An earlier version of this article overstated Celsius’ recent funding round. It was $19.2 million crowdfunded on BnkToTheFuture including, not in addition to, $10 million from Tether.

The private keys guarding the BTC are stored using Keep, the firm’s system for storing secrets in a usable fashion on the world computer. Few secrets are more useful and valuable than bitcoin private keys.","","","That said, a vocal cohort of bitcoin partisans has been very publicly skeptical of DeFi, but TBTC\u0027s creator doesn\u0027t think that represents the broader view. After all, more people hold bitcoin than ever before.","","","\"The silent majority of most bitcoin and ETH people aren\u0027t maximalists,\" Matt Luongo told CoinDesk in a phone call.","","","Luongo is the CEO and founder of Thesis, a blockchain development studio. The idea for Keep arose out of building bitcoin rewards app Fold, which needed ways to store data in public, privately. While not committing to a precise timeline, Luongo said both Keep and TBTC will go live at the same time – in a matter of \"weeks not months.\"","","","The new funding round was led by Paradigm Capital, with participation from Fenbushi Capital, Collaborative Fund and others. In December 2018, Keep had a prior round that included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital and Draper Associates.","","","\"Decentralized financial applications on Ethereum have seen clear demand,\" Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam said in a statement. \"Bitcoin is the world\u0027s largest cryptocurrency. Building a bridge that allows Bitcoin to interact with DeFi makes a lot of sense, and tBTC is a credible attempt to do exactly that.\"","","","Luongo is himself extremely long BTC, but he\u0027s not one of those bitcoin diehards who dismisses DeFi.","","","\"I think the whole Bitcoin-Ethereum cultural split has outlived its usefulness,\" he said.","","","Bitcoin is already on Ethereum, most notably with wBTC, an ERC-20 token created by BitGo.","","","Naturally, wBTC builds on its creator\u0027s strengths. BitGo serves as the custodian and lets anyone check its BTC balances against outstanding wBTC. But having a centralized, identifiable custodian could potentially introduce censorship risks in the eyes of some users.","","","Conversely, TBTC is an application built to allow trustless storage of the bitcoin backing tBTC tokens. To mint one tBTC, a user contacts the Keep network, which designates a wallet for storing the bitcoin. The keys for that wallet are held in a multi-sig structure across several nodes on the Keep network that have staked KEEP tokens.","","","This is just what Keep was built for, Luongo explained. \"It let\u0027s you operate with private material and choose people to hold it randomly,\" he said.","","","The chosen nodes collateralize the BTC with ETH at 150 percent of the value of the underlying BTC. Then the tBTC token gets minted to the bitcoin owner\u0027s wallet.","","","That token can be used in DeFi apps that accept it (more on that later). Anytime they want to unlock their bitcoin, the tBTC creator simply needs to return an equal amount of tBTC to the smart contract, which will burn the tBTC and return the bitcoin to a wallet the user controls.","","","Interestingly, Luongo said, ETH is likely to work better for collateral for BTC than a stablecoin, because the two cryptos tend to be fairly correlated. So if BTC price makes a big move, ETH will probably make a similar move, making it less likely for the ETH collateral to get liquidated.","","","There\u0027s very little reason to have bitcoin on Ethereum if there\u0027s nothing to do with it, though, so the product will only work well if DeFi applications adopt tBTC. In part, Luongo explained, that\u0027s why Thesis sought a fresh round of funding.","","","\"As TBTC is the first app on Keep we want to make sure it lands,\" Luongo said.","","","Stani Kulechov runs Aave (formerly ETHLend), the number four application on DeFi, according to DeFi Pulse. Aave has a half-million dollars worth of wBTC on the application, which is fairly small compared to other tokens its users stake.","","","\"I think DeFi is still alien to Bitcoin holders,\" Kulechov told CoinDesk in an email.","","","That said, he also believes that the yields found in DeFi are attracting more and more hodlers. His company has been watching tBTC along with other projects working to get BTC onto Ethereum, such as Ren and pTokens.","","","\"These new alternatives are actually bringing quite innovative solutions to reduce trust and custody,\" Kulechov wrote. \"That might be another factor that could accelerate BTC liquidity into Ethereum.\"",""],"create_date":"2020-04-02T17:00:12Z","tag":"Venture Capital, Token Sales, Paradigm, DeFi, Fold, Thesis","author":"Brady Dale"}]
