Personal assistants like Google Assistant and Siri rely on AI to process speech input. Recommendation engines that suggest songs, restaurants, or news stories are also powered by AI. Then there are headline-grabbing projects such as AlphaGo, which used an artificial neural network to defeat human players in one of the most complex strategy games ever created. There’s little doubt we’re entering a future powered by AI. Some organizations are even using it to scan for diseases and search for exoplanets. But the cost of running these applications is difficult to ignore. Many startups spend as much as 20-30% of their funding on hardware operational costs alone. DeepBrain Chain hopes to address the problem of rising processing costs by combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. Early estimates suggest enterprises can save as much as 70% by purchasing data and processing power through DeepBrain instead of building their own infrastructure. Recently, the DeepBrain Chain team announced their first successful runs of AI models on the testnet, signaling the project’s initial steps to public availability. Problems of Cost More than 5,000 AI startups have launched in the last 5 years. Venture Scanner reports funding for these projects has a compound annual growth rate of 83%, reaching over $14 billion in 2017. Q1 2018 had a record $2.5 billion in industry-wide funding, an increase of 11% over Q1 2017. AlphaGo is one of the most famous applications of deep learning and artificial intelligence. Its developer, DeepMind, was purchased by Google in 2014. Despite the venture’s well-publicized successes, DeepMind continues to post financial losses every year, running up a debt of over $162 million in 2016 alone. Operating costs and legal fees play a large role in DeepMind’s financial state, but running AlphaGo isn’t exactly cheap, either. The version of AlphaGo that played South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol ran on 1,920 standard processors and 280 modified GPUs, contributing to an operating cost of $3,000 for a single game. Getting any AI model to perform with appreciable accuracy requires thousands of hours of training. It’s easy to see how AI enterprises can rack up high hardware bills in an attempt to launch a single artificial intelligence product. Other companies working with machine learning and artificial intelligence face similar problems as DeepMind. Most of them can’t rely on the bottomless pockets of a parent company the size of Google to keep them funded. Cutting costs is crucial to continued operation, and the 30% that goes toward hardware is a great place to start. AI funding from 2011-2018 — Image via venturescanner.com Enter DeepBrain Chain Blockchain technology is the perfect solution to curb the rising costs of running AI applications. It’s a fast-growing, scalable, and profitable sector that has begun breaking into the mainstream, thanks to the popularity of cryptocurrencies. DeepBrain Chain will operate as a decentralized marketplace for data and processing power. It currently runs on the NEO blockchain but will split to its own sidechain once the mainnet releases. Enterprises can then purchase the amounts of processing power required to run their applications without having to invest in a dedicated infrastructure of their own. DeepBrain will meet the needs of these organizations by providing a flexible, high-performance, low latency network that preserves privacy through decentralization and encryption. Early estimates project a cost savings of at least 70% for most clients. Testnet Successes On June 3, 2018, DeepBrain Chain’s development team successfully ran three types of real-world AI training models on the private testnet. Results of these test weren’t announced, but the purpose wasn’t to test the AI, only the testnet’s ability to run the programs in a working environment. The first successful test was the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database, a sort of “Hello World” for machine learning. The DeepBrain team successfully ran MNIST on the testnet with a limited subset of 250 images. The full MNIST test contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits sampled from high school students and U.S. Census Bureau staff members. The AI must use image recognition on each scan to interpret the markings and correctly identify as many numbers as possible. The second AI test was a natural language processing model run using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs analyze images as groups of pixels at a time, allowing it to detect shapes and edges by comparing differences in matrix data. When tasked to language processing, CNNs are able to “see” words in a document and decipher simple meanings from context. Finally, the DeepBrain team successfully ran a Chinese text categorization model using a pre-trained version of doc2vector. This program is an extension of word2vec that constructs word embeddings from scanned documents of text. The model is commonly used to reconstruct linguistic context from document inputs, essentially allowing neural networks to understand written language. Roadmap and Milestones In January 2018, DeepBrain announced a partnership with a Disney licensee on a series of Mickey Mouse toys that listen and respond to speech input. The educational robot shipped more than 3 million units in 2017. DeepBrain will assist in upgrading its learning capabilities for its next product run. The most notable upcoming event is the launch of DeepBrain Chain’s testnet scheduled for the end of June. With the success of the initial tests, the team feels the product is ready to accept public applications. The mainnet release will follow months later with a scheduled October 2018 launch. The Skynet Project was opened in mid-June 2018 to help strengthen the network in preparation for going public. Users that meet the hardware requirements can apply to join Skynet and earn mainnet mining priority rights, extra consensus node points, and free use of DeepBrain resources while Skynet Project is operational. DeepBrain Chain has forged a partnership with SingularityNET, an open, decentralized AI stack solution that aims to democratize access to artificial intelligence. The alliance will allow the sharing of data and processing services between both platforms through a framework the teams are currently building. DeepBrain Chain’s roadmap carries the platform through the mainnet launch in October 2018 and includes testing and refinement throughout 2019. Future of DeepBrain Chain DeepBrain Chain is the world’s first blockchain-based AI computing platform, and it arrived just in time to capitalize on a booming industry. Tech giants Google and Baidu have spent between $20-30 billion on AI development. The industry itself could be worth over a trillion dollars by 2035. To put that in perspective, OPEC’s net oil export revenue hit its modern-day peak at $917 billion in 2012 and has fallen by nearly half since then. DeepBrain Chain currently focuses much of its efforts on enterprises in China, a country poised to become a world leader in artificial intelligence. DeepBrain CEO He Yong attributes this to how easy it is to collect and utilize data in China compared to other countries. There are some concerns about DeepBrain’s ability and willingness to expand into other territories, most notably Europe and the United States. As the partnership with SingularityNET suggests, DeepBrain Chain doesn’t intend to stay a China-focused project forever. So far, the future looks bright for DeepBrain Chain. It landed a spot in our features on exciting NEO projects and promising AI blockchain projects earlier this year. If the testnet and mainnet launches go smoothly, DeepBrain Chain could be the first project that companies turn to when sourcing AI partnerships.

Substratum Node Early Open Beta offers almost all the features the final version will, minus video viewing, and they urge users to try it out and offer feedback.","title":"Substratum Node Early Open Beta is Live!","content":" Cryptocurrencies & PlatformsNews Substratum Node Early Open Beta is Live! May 22, 2018 By Anna Snyder Substratum is an ERC-20 cryptocurrency which tends to fly under the radar. But when you take a close look, they’re a platform with an ambitious and exciting plan for a decentralized, P2P internet network. Essentially, Substratum aims to apply the sharing economy to the internet itself, in particular web hosting and access to content. Anyone can turn their computer into a web host running a Substratum node, and whenever that node serves content, the user will be paid a reward in the Substratum token (SUB). While the obvious incentive here is the passive income you can earn by participating in the decentralized network, there are more socially conscious benefits as well. Substratum works on all browsers, and it requires no special software, which means that it provides a workaround to censorship and countries that ban VPNs. Substratum also offers an individualized payment model; instead of paying a monthly bill, internet users pay for the amount of bandwidth they use. Similarly, users renting their computing power specify how much they want to give out, and at what time of day. In every way, Substratum is working to make the internet more customizable to our individual needs. How Substratum Works The Substratum ecosystem is made up of essentially three components – hosts, nodes, and end-users – who each perform a different function in maintaining the network. Hosts Anyone with a computer, both individuals and businesses, can act as a host. Hosts provide content for the decentralized web, adding new websites and apps. Hosts pay based on the number of clicks their website receives, rather than for uptime. This makes for a direct relationship between a website’s popularity and the cost to its host, allowing for a more egalitarian system of fees. Nodes So what happens when a user requests a site or a piece of content? With a decentralized network of nodes, Substratum allocates multiple nodes towards a single piece of data, and Artificial Intelligence determines the quickest way of delivering the information to the user. With data split between multiple nodes, and with unique encryption technology, Substratum ensures maximum security for data transactions. With each delivery a node makes, they earn a reward in Substrate (SUB), Substratum’s native token. Moreover, the Substratum node is designed to accommodate your personal computer usage, and will run on low power in the background so as not to interfere with your activity. When your computer is idle, the node will then automatically become more active, thus increasing the amount of passive income you earn. Host, Node, and End-User. Source: https://substratum.net/how-it-works/ End-Users Users who visit websites hosted on Substratum will be able to view and experience content exactly the same as with any other websites, and they’ll be able to access it through their standard browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc. All Substratum-hosted websites can be accessed from any device, mobile or PC. Users will also avail of all Substratum’s tools and services, including internet payment app CryptoPay (more on that later). Once Substratum is up and running, hosts, nodes, and end-users will continue to cooperate as moderators of the network. Content will be regulated by the Substratum community, through a voting system in which high-quality material is promoted and harmful or misleading material is downvoted and ultimately removed. The voting takes into account how much SUB users have, their amount of time holding it, and their previous voting activity to make sure that users most active in the Substratum community have more power in the governance of the ecosystem. Experience Substratum Node Early Open Beta Today If you’ve been a loyal follower of Substratum, or if you’ve just heard of them but are excited to try them out, you’ll be glad to know that they went open-source on April 23, 2018, and their Substratum Node Early Open Beta has just gone live. This provides an exciting chance for users to get in on the action and get familiar with all the functions the complete Substratum will offer. Users can experience Substratum’s vision for a decentralized internet, and provide feedback to help them get the bugs out. And for those not quite ready to commit to being a full-time node, once you install the beta version you’ll be able to toggle back and forth between Substratum and your normal UI. Here is what Substratum Node Early Open Beta will include: Basic User Interface This beta is still a rough model, as they wanted to roll out the UI for testing with the public as soon as possible, rather than spend however many more months fine-tuning it. As such, the services and functions available to test-run will be the most basic, with the final, sleeker version to come in the future. Included in Substratum’s beta model is their crypto payment tool, CryptoPay, which is similar to PayPal and other payment apps but allows for a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Website hosts can utilize the CryptoPay tool, which will convert payments in fiat and other cryptocurrencies into SUB seamlessly. Internet Access You’ll still be able to perform most of your regular internet functions using the Substratum network – however, streaming videos will not yet be available on the beta version, among a few other functions. For those, you’ll have to wait until the final version. Neighborhoods Neighborhoods from the Cores network will be released with version 0.4.0 of Substratum, which is the next stage after beta. This will include multiple exciting features, such as the capacity to route around firewalls and have the entire internet at your fingertips. Earning Mechanism While the current beta version of Substratum won’t include the ability to earn money based on hosting a node, if you hang around until version 0.5.0, then you’ll finally have access to all of Substratum’s defining features. These include earning cryptocurrency for hosting, viewing the entire internet, and more. Feedback All participants of the Substratum Node Early Open Beta version are urged to provide feedback on their user experience. Not only will this help Substratum work out the kinks and become the very best it can be, but this is your chance to contribute to the decentralization of the internet via blockchain. Substratum is steadily expanding its reach, and can be bought and traded on Binance, KuCoin, Coss.io, and HitBTC. The SubstratumNode 0.3.0 Early Open Beta is available for download.

What is this platform all about, and why is its existence a good thing?","title":"Decentraland: Virtual Reality Meets Blockchain Fun","content":" Cryptocurrencies & Platforms Decentraland: Virtual Reality Meets Blockchain Fun January 10, 2018 By Nadja Bester Have you ever had the thought that, if such things were possible, you’d like to remake the world? While eradicating poverty and health crises might be on top of many people’s lists, these are solutions we’re still crawling towards. Blockchain might be addressing issues like providing financial services or mobile data to the unbanked, or cleaning up the fishing industry, but it’s a far cry from terraforming our social structures into the ideal versions we’d like to see. On a more fun, practical level, however, blockchain technology is taking us back to our childhood days, when playing The Sims was all the rage. Decentraland, however, takes the concept of a virtual lalaland one step further by building us a decentralised, interactive 3D world, owned and designed by users, where VR (virtual reality) rules the roost. Decentra-what? Decentraland is a publicly owned, customizable virtual world that lives on the blockchain. This means that, with the amount of virtual real estate available within the Decentraland environment, buyers will be able to secure a piece of it, have their ownership live on a public ledger, and utilize their owned space however they see fit. Decentraland, first conceived of in 2015, has been developing in 4 distinct phases. We will take a look at each of these in turn. Decentraland’s Evolution The Stone Age June 2015 kicked off with the first version of Decentraland, in which users were awarded pixels on an infinite 2D grid. Each pixel contained metadata used to identify its owner, but utilization of such spaces was limited to the technology it was using and didn’t provision for newsworthy use-cases. The Bronze Age Fast-forward to March 2017: Decentraland moves over to 3D, where it is divided into land parcels. A Bitcoin blockchain now verifies ownership, and a world editor has been added, allowing for greater customization of one’s piece of virtual real estate. The Iron Age With the incorporation of the ERC-20 token, MANA, in August 2017 and a terraform auctioning event in Q4 2017, users are now able to claim LAND and interact with other users in the Decentraland ecosystem. This social experience is enriched by allowing developers to build apps on top of Decentraland, which they’re able to distribute to users and monetize in the process. Users are now able to incorporate scripting (i.e. interactive content) onto owned land, making such spaces come alive with custom apps that change the user experience. Custom items and multiplayer support has been added, along with avatars and peer-to-peer communications in the form of live chat. It also includes the introduction of an in-game cryptocurrency payment system. The Silicon Age According to the company website, the upcoming Silicon Age (date TBA) will bring with it “a full-fledged 3D world, with full VR support and customization of the laws of physics. Live in the blockchain.” What does this level of futuristic tech imply for the use of the platform? Image courtesy of Decentraland Use cases Technology is only ever as exciting or interesting as what it’s able to provide the average user with. So, apart from its highly unique blockchain concept, what makes Decentraland worth looking into? These are some of its potential use cases: Advertising (think virtual billboards dotting land parcels and virtual versions of New York City’s Times Square) Applications (a wide variety of applications, all designed to enrich and deepen the Decentraland experience) Content curation (neighborhoods that have shared interests in common will become niche hubs) Digital collectibles (yes, even CryptoKitties! Users will be able to publish, distribute, and collect any type of blockchain-issued digital asset, an area that’s ripe for innovation by creators) Education (an industry that is notoriously slow to adopt new technologies, but with a gigantic user base that could potentially benefit from being exposed to educational experiences within Decentraland) Social groups (communities like chat groups, online forums, and centralized multiplayer games could all plug their tribes into the Decentraland ecosystem, while offline communities could utilize the space to expand their activities online) Training and professional development (limited only by course designers’ and facilitators’ imaginations, Decentraland could provide a highly engaging backdrop) Virtual tourism (why leave the comfort of your seat when you can take a virtual reality tour to made-up worlds that celebrate the pinnacle of human creativity and ingenuity) The Role of an Ecosystem like Decentraland in Modern Society A few years ago, Second Life was all the rage. While enthusiasts loved the idea of shedding their identities to become virtual versions of whatever they wanted to be, skeptics were highly critical of a pastime which they saw as hedonistic and escapist. Is Decentraland merely an updated cousin of the erstwhile online world that, in its heyday, hosted a million registered users? Certainly, one cannot deny the fact that there are more pressing matters in the world than traversing made-up 3D spaces inside your computer. However, human life is varied and nuanced. We might use blockchain technology to make the supply chain transparent, but we can also have some fun with it. The online realm is gaining more and more influence in the real world – many people’s jobs and livelihoods take place entirely over computers, for example – so why not showcase the best of what our creative and social genes have to offer? And for this, Decentraland is on standby, ready to offer users interesting, immersive experiences in the virtual world, powered by the blockchain.

Can blockchain technology transform this space?","title":"Can Blockchain Save the Fishing Industry?","content":" Cryptocurrencies & Platforms Can Blockchain Save the Fishing Industry? November 21, 2017 By Nadja Bester Fishing is big business. But with an ever-increasing world population that is placing increasing strain on the world’s natural resources, overfishing is a mounting concern. Experts are saying we’re not nearly as proactive on this front as we should be. Regulators and watch groups have firm regulations and management tactics in place, but the sector continues to be plagued by fraudulent and exploitative practices. Can blockchain technology come to our rescue? What’s Wrong with the Fishing Industry Seafood is currently the world’s largest traded food commodity. Harkening back to our earliest ancestors, fishing is still fundamental to the livelihood of many coastal communities around the world. In fact, 50 percent of the world’s seafood catch originates from an estimated 90 million small-scale fishers. Commercially, big fisheries in every country are stocking up on fast disappearing seafood bounty to satisfy increased consumer demands in both local and export markets. The global population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, and there won’t be enough seafood in the world’s oceans to feed everyone. While this forms part of a much larger discussion about sustainable food production and consumption, the fisheries industry has its own regulation and management measurements in place to preemptively combat some of these issues. One such measure is to regulate the fishing of certain species according to their breeding cycles. This would ensure that the specific ecology of fish species is afforded an opportunity to increase its numbers without overfishing the stock or even driving it extinct. Control and surveillance form an important part of fisheries management, and an ecosystemic approach is cardinal to managing what many see as an inevitable losing battle. A breakdown of fishing rights, courtesy of the Fishery Solutions Center Issues that plague this measure are illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU). Seafood fraud, misrepresenting or mislabeling seafood, is another major industry ill. Even an important human rights issue like slavery is still a modern-day reality in this industry. How the Blockchain Can Help Blockchain alone has the unique technological advantage in that it provides incorruptible data that is based not on agendas but on network-wide verifiable facts. It does this in a decentralized environment that is not limited to the data-supporting capabilities of any one central organization. Turning its attention to the seafood industry, the tech shows a lot of promise in fighting the battle against IUU, seafood fraud, and undue exploitation of fishermen. Traceability is a major factor in ensuring compliance with national and international regulations. Traditionally, traceability has had a heavy reliance on self-reporting and claims that were not easy to track and trace. Blockchain is a major differentiator. Image courtesy of Oceana. To that end, two companies in the blockchain industry are making inroads by introducing blockchain to the global fight against an unsustainable seafood industry. Earth Twine Earth Twine is a collaborative technology company working to transform the world’s seafood supply, aiming to bring greater transparency to the industry through technology. The business was started over 10 years ago thanks to a passion for quality food sourcing. Having since evolved into a seafood industry-focused organization, blockchain technology is their latest contribution to supporting the industry. President Nancy O’Mallon has said that the 2011 introduction of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) is what prompted her to provide affordable and interoperable software for all stakeholders involved in the process. Earth Twine now incorporates blockchain technology into their processes by employing SPARKL technology to connect data to the blockchain and allow for tamper-free auditing. They have also partnered with Stratis to increase their dedication to supporting IUU compliance. Through the Earth Twine-Stratis Platform, the world’s first seafood industry blockchain for tracking and origin data, Earth Twine will provide the world’s seafood supply with a trustless audit trail. Image courtesy of Stratis According to CFO Jill Brownson: Most supply chain software solutions have strength in the finance side or the supply chain side – rarely both. Data in newer Supply Chain software is usually easy to access by “super users” and make them less dependent on IT. Supply Chain software is written to address the typical needs of business, not the specific needs of an industry. Being able to develop an industry-specific software solution with current technology and crypto-currency allows the design to be done that can be solid and easy, and more cost-effective for users to access the data that they need while recording the necessary regulatory information. Follow them on Twitter. Provenance Invest in Blockchain has previously featured Provenance, a blockchain supply chain traceability company. Provenance piloted a track-and-trace project in Indonesia. The pilot was focused on supply chain tracking of Yellowfin and Skipjack tuna, and designed to test scaling of end-to-end (E2E) traceability. In Indonesia, fishing is an important source of employment and national export, but purse seine (trawl net) fishing – especially Philippine tuna fishing vessels – poses a big threat to the livelihoods of countless traditional fishermen. Image courtesy of Provenance Phase I of the Provenance pilot enabled local fishermen to register a catch via SMS, which registers a new asset on the blockchain each time a message is sent. Thanks to unique (and permanent) IDs, each asset is transferred from fisherman to supplier, making the catch 100% trackable. Phase II linked the blockchain with existing systems, and Phase III explored the consumer experience. This pilot will eventually translate into worldwide consumption empowerment, whereby consumers will be assured that the seafood they consume has its sustainable origins that empowers the local community and supports human rights. Image courtesy of Provenance Provenance concluded the pilot saying: The blockchain won’t solve traceability alone and indeed much of our pilot was spent looking at how information could even be digitised, let alone shared or secured. However, it does provide an ideal base layer upon which architectures for robust traceability systems can be built and participated in without ownership by the biggest or richest actor. It could also open up a powerful driver within this system – access to a premium payment for a fish that is of known origin and proven to be compliant with standards. Follow them on Twitter. A message that we reiterate over and over is that blockchain, being in its infancy, is neither a quick-fix nor a panacea, but it’s opening up hitherto-impossible technological solutions to pressing problems. The efforts of these companies working in the seafood industry are but two of countless next steps to employ blockchain and other future technologies to empower industry transformations.

Learn 4 ways that smart smarts will change the world.","title":"4 Reasons Smart Contracts Will Change the World","content":" Blockchain Basics 4 Reasons Smart Contracts Will Change the World October 26, 2017 By Mike Hulleman Emerging financial technologies go well beyond the international banking system. Some of them start with disrupting the world of finance and then stretch their fingers into other markets and industries. Here are a few examples of one such technology; the blockchain “smart contract” –poised to take over a job near you. Blockchain smart contracts are a sudden death for many different jobs and tasks typically reserved for humans of the white collar variety. From within every niche market, smart contracts have the potential to disrupt or further automate jobs to the point where they may just put people out of a job; lawyers, asset managers, accountants, supply chain controllers, record keepers, dispatchers, lab assistants, warehouse managers, election officers, insurance brokers, Agile scrum masters, travel agents — even historians — could have their jobs forced below their current pay grade or automated entirely. Yes, many of these jobs are already automated. However, they often still rely on the accountability of a signature and a last name. Smart contracts have finally cracked one thing humans have relied on to justify their salaries: accountability. What is a Smart Contract? Wikipedia has a pretty straightforward definition of what a smart contract is; “A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract”. Simply put; a smart contract can facilitate the numerous touch points in a contract process, verify, and then enforce them. And since every process can be mapped, this means that any process a human can do, a smart contract can do just as well, if not faster, and much more efficiently. In essence, they’re apps that run on a blockchain. Understanding Smart Contracts By the year 2017, just about everything in the physical world has had a digital representation created to turn it into a data point. The most rudimentary example of this is a library book; for every library book printed and stocked onto a shelf, there’s a data point that represents that book. Each book even has a complete digital copy that can be read without reading the physical book. A library book’s data point can be shuffled around a digital world — it can be checked in, checked out, associated to the profile of a borrower, or the library itself. The status of said data point can mean late charges to a borrower’s profile (account), or it can mean it is free for another borrower. It’s digital status defines its place in the physical world, and vice versa. Perhaps somewhere along the way the book has been damaged, its condition noted as an attribute on its data point, and it will then be sent off for rebinding automatically. Today, with human oversight and a range of proprietary softwares linked together, grocery stores automatically order new stock, insurance policies are written, paid for, and activated, assets are tracked and sent back to their leasing companies when their lease has ended. You’re probably thinking, yes, these things have been automated for quite some time. Today’s processes run inside inefficient closed software that is horrendously integrated to allow them to talk to each other and verification of many processes are placed in a queue awaiting human eyes. It’s a bit of a mess. Related: What is Blockchain Technology? Benefits of a Smart Contract Smart contracts live on a shared database where all parties have a copy –unlike today’s systems where every company keeps and stores their own records. If anything in the physical world can represent a data point with attributes and rules, then it can be organized into a smart contract. With this in mind, here are some key benefits of a smart contract: 1. Instant Verification With smart contracts, transactions occur the moment contract terms are fulfilled. At the time of writing, it can still potentially take months for an asset to be moved from one point to another after a contract is signed. Like sitting on a runway waiting for the go-ahead for a takeoff. There is no long-winded verification process to cover asses or appease an insurance company with a smart contract. Approvals are verified in real-time, based on present conditions without a human bottleneck or a signature — without a name. Where complex “agreements” need a second or third set of eyes, smart contracts move forward with the utmost speed and efficiency. 2. Authority Why trust a smart contract? Smart contracts are stored on a blockchain that is duplicated into a series of copies stored across a network of separate machines. In other words, it’s immutable. If one copy is hacked or incorrectly altered by a human, the majority eliminates the anomaly. The processing power required to fudge a blockchain ledger entry doesn’t exist today. And as new technologies arise, the complexity required to administer changes to the blockchain can, too. In other words, trust is built into the system. Unlike anything seen before. 3. Transparency When all smart contracts are transacted without any ambiguity on a transparent system that keeps a digital ledger that cannot be compromised because it’s backed up across a massive network hundreds or thousands of times, all data can be reviewed, and reviewed, and reviewed. In other words, a building can’t get hit by a mysterious gas leak and disappear with all the records it contained. There’s an audit trail that cannot be corrupted with existing technologies. In the least, this simplifies dispute resolution to a T. 4. Enhanced Privacy Structure Existing blockchain technologies are fully transparent. In fact, if you come across a blockchain address you can scan it or enter it into a corresponding database and view transactions. You might not know who owns it, though. The Ethereum address account QR code below can be scanned to reveal the balance of its account. But who owns that account? In a sea of somewhat anonymous addresses, general privacy exists today. However, new smart contract technologies leverage privacy permissions to ensure that they are only seen by those which possess the proper roles or levels of access. As smart contracts continue to find their way into the homes of reputable business, the security and privacy of smart contracts will become more standardized and trustworthy. In Summary In a nutshell, smart contracts tighten the laces of existing processes and allow for more autonomy. Sharing a database with all related parties and allowing them all to keep an up-to-date copy ensure trust and transparency while adding speed and efficiency to any process they facilitate. Can you think of any other reasons smart contracts will change the world?

They've launched a ad trial program and announced a key partnership with Qwant.","title":"Brave News: After 10 Million Downloads, Brave Launches Ad Trial Program and Secures an Important Partner","content":" Cryptocurrencies & PlatformsNews Brave News: After 10 Million Downloads, Brave Launches Ad Trial Program and Secures an Important Partner September 22, 2018 By Yaz Sheikh Download the Brave Browser. After hitting 4 million active users, Brave has announced a new advertising trial and secured an important partnership. The Brave browser is a privacy-focused web browser that is focused on keeping user data private and secure. It comes with built-in privacy support features that allow for ad blocking, script disabling, and cookie & tracker blocking. Moreso, it aims to rethink the way that the online advertising industry delivers advertisements by creating an advertising platform based off of users attention. An Impressive Achievement: Over 10 Million Downloads in Google Play Store The team behind the Brave browser continue to achieve commendable milestones as they recently breached over 10 million downloads in the Google Play Store and reached over 4 million active users. This is an impressive achievement, as increasing the pool of users allows the Brave team to have an increased ability to on-board new advertisers within their platform. The list of achievements continues after the announcement of Brave receiving approval from Apple to use BAT in iOS apps and the announcement regarding the ability to tip users on Reddit and Twitter through the Brave browser. The rapidly expanding web browser has now announced an official advertising trial program to gather more data for research and development. Brave Begins Public Advertising Program Trial Brave has announced a public advertising program trial that will collect user’s data on browsing activity. The advertising trial is specifically for Mac users who download a special ‘test’ build of the Brave browser from the announcement page. A 28-Day Experiment The advertising trial is designed so the advertising system built by Brave will experience testing under some real-world browsing behavior. The program will run for 28 days. The Brave team has emphasized that the regular browser does not and will never collect any user information or data. This is strictly for this specific build downloaded by testers. The specific build of the Brave browser for the advertising trial will monitor users’ information such as: URLs visited, when the Brave browser was used, wi-fi information, user IP address, and information on advertisements shown, clicked, or dismissed. The information and data collected from the trial will be deleted after 1 year, and will only be handled by researchers assigned to use the data. An Important Test for the Platform The advertising trial is a crucial step in bringing the real advertising program live. The official advertising program is created to reward users that view adverts. Users that opt-in to view advertisements can receive up to a 70% share of the advertising revenues from the advertisement. Bringing such a broad vision—rethinking the entire online advertising industry—will require many stages of testing. With the public advertising trial underway, we can only assume that the Brave team are on track to bringing this revolutionary vision to life. If you would like to help out the Brave team, go ahead and take part in the advertising trial by downloading the test build here. The advertising trials started on September 13, 2018, so there is still plenty time to get involved. Partnership With Qwant To add further to the Brave headlines, the team has recently announced an important partnership with a privacy-focused search engine known as Qwant. Brave Drops Google for Qwant In a world where privacy is a hotly contested topic, a partnership between Qwant and Brave makes sense. Brave has elected to drop Google as their default search engine and decided to use Qwant in its place for users in Germany and France. Qwant has been commonly described as a search engine that respects its users privacy. The search engine does not collect or share users’ personal information. It has its own unique web-indexing technology that protects privacy by refusing to install cookies or trackers to help in their advertising goals. Privacy by Default The combination of these two privacy-focused technologies helps bring the topic of user privacy to a level playing field, granting users a choice to remain protected online by default. This helps breed a more sustainable internet that is not driven on big data and commercial advertising. As Brendan Eich, CEO and creator of Brave, stated: By combining Brave and Qwant, users can enjoy the web in a way that does not violate their privacy. By using products such as Brave, users are no longer susceptible to being the product when they surf the web. They will also benefit from the experience of faster loading times relative to other popular browsers, saving money from not loading ads, a more private experience, and the ability to give back to their favorite content producers through the integrated Basic Attention Token (BAT) wallet. Conclusion Despite the general outlook of the market, the Brave team continue to make progression in their marketing and development. With such a fantastic product and team, BAT investors still have much to continue to look forward to. Related: Blockchain Projects That Are Leading the Web 3.0 Evolution Download the Brave Browser.

We break down the nuances in this article.","title":"What Exactly Is Blockchain, Anyway?","content":" Blockchain Basics What Exactly Is Blockchain, Anyway? October 18, 2017 By Matt Bourke What if I told you: Blockchain doesn’t exist. Or that blockchain has two totally different meanings. Or that blockchain is a name given to three totally different things. Hear me out. A blockchain is a very inefficient database most famously implemented as one of several parts required for the Bitcoin jigsaw puzzle to work. Bitcoin technology is the technology behind “blockchain”, rather than blockchain technology being the technology behind Bitcoin. “Blockchain technology” is completely separate from “a blockchain” or “the blockchain”. Confused? From a technical standpoint, there are nuances in these different terms. In this article, you’ll learn what each term really means and gain a deeper understanding of how blockchain works. Let’s Start With “Blockchain Technology” Blockchain technology simply means a decentralised trustless network that works by having a native asset, a decentralised ledger and some algorithms based around a game theory model that allows everyone on the network to reach consensus. What Is “A Blockchain”? Imagine you have an excel spreadsheet. Each row on the spreadsheet has a few columns and one of these columns holds a “transaction”. Now, if each row has a column that contains a unique fingerprint (a hash) of all the data in that row plus the hash of all the data in the previous row, then these rows would be chained together forming what we call a “hash chain”. An example of multiple items hash chained together. All data has a unique hash value; it’s like a unique fingerprint, modifying any item will break the chain. A user could run a software that checks these hashes. It would hash chain each row together and see if all the hashes are valid. If any hash is invalid, the user will know that someone has forged a row at a later date or time (after the chain was originally created). A hash chain can be very useful but isn’t anything exciting. So how does a hash chain relate to “a blockchain”? Let’s imagine that instead of rows in a spreadsheet, you have multiple spreadsheets and each spreadsheet is full of multiple transactions. We’ll call this combined group of transactions a “block of transactions”. If you create a single hash of all the data in one spreadsheet, then a hash of all the data in another spreadsheet, and then a hash of each spreadsheet’s hashes, you would have a spreadsheet chain. Remember, these spreadsheets contain a block of transactions so this is effectively a simple blockchain. So What Is Then Meant By “Blockchain”? Well, originally, “blockchain” was a way for big incumbent corporations to sound like they’re being disruptive without having to use a disruptive sounding name like “cryptocurrency” or “decentralized ledger”. Saying “we’re doing blockchain” made investors take note. Today, “blockchain” has become so widespread that it basically means “an open access computer network built around a decentralised ledger”. We’re starting to see “blockchain” that isn’t even using “a blockchain” but instead other storage technology. For example, there’s DAG or Directed Acyclic Graph (a whole new topic of discussion for a later time). When many incumbents say “blockchain”, they actually mean “a shared database, shared with only those we trust”. This is nothing new; distributed databases have been around for at least a decade before Bitcoin. Where Is The Magic In “Blockchain”? The magic is not in the data storage technology, but how untrusted users of the network can all reach consensus. Here’s an example. With “blockchain”, everyone agrees that Alice paid Bob, and Bob only. With her transaction, there is proof that she hasn’t double spent (e.g. sent $5 to Bob and sent the exact same $5 to John at the exact same time). The double spending problem is the main breakthrough that Bitcoin made. This transaction information is stored in “a blockchain” tied to the network. Any user of the network can download a copy of this blockchain if they choose to do so, and run software that validates transactions as they come in across the network. This software will reject any double spending attempts. If the transaction is valid, the software will update ownership of the coins (or other asset) in the blockchain. When a user makes a transaction with “blockchain”, what their software is actually doing is the following: The software (the user’s wallet) creates a script. This script is written in a computer language that all the computers on the network can process and validate. The script is signed with a private key, and users of the network can prove ownership of a blockchain asset by proving they own the private key. Once ownership is proved using a digital signature, the network can then move forward with processing the script. The simplest scripts will simply say “give $5 from Alice to Bob”. The computers on the network will then validate that Alice has an entry in the blockchain; if it’s valid, the whole network will agree to update Alice’s account to have $5 less and Bob’s account to have $5 more. Interesting fact: A common misconception is “Bitcoin doesn’t do contracts”. It does! A script is a contract. When you hear the term “smart contract”, it’s a marketing term for a transaction script. The big problem with “blockchain” is solving the double spending problem — what I’ve explained above doesn’t solve this. What if two computers on different sides of the world both receive a different script from Alice at the same time? One script says “give Bob $5” and another script says “give Susan $5” — how does the network work out consensus? You see, the magic of “blockchain” isn’t “a blockchain”; it’s Proof of Work. Proof of Work is a computer algorithm that blockchain networks use to ensure the network remains decentralised, and to prevent a computer on the network from building its own version of history. Here’s a very simple way to think of Proof of Work. Imagine the network runs a lottery system, and every few minutes the network will randomly choose a winning computer on the network. The network says “This computer here is the winner!” Then the network says to the winning computer, “Give every other computer your latest block of valid transactions along with your winning lottery ticket. If you can prove you have the winning lottery ticket, all of the other computers will then check that the block you’ve given contains only valid transactions. If so, we’ll update our blockchain to have your newly created block ,and in return we’ll give you a reward.” This is cryptocurrency mining simplified. By only allowing one user to provide a block of transactions, we can ensure that Alice’s double spend attempt only goes into one block as a single entry. If different computers are building a different block of transactions and Alice currently has several double spend transactions floating around the network, Alice can only ultimately make a single spend. This is due to the entire network updating their copy of the blockchain all at once to contain the latest new block, and ignoring anything that doesn’t align with this block. Everyone now has the latest copy of the blockchain, and any new block created has to be hash chained on top of the current blockchain. What is “The Blockchain”? Generally, this term is often assigned to the first blockchain – the Bitcoin blockchain. However, today with marketing speak, this can often mean anything.

Here, we highlight our 5 favorite freedom-loving blockchain projects.","title":"5 Blockchain Projects That Are Increasing Our Freedom","content":" AnalysisCryptocurrencies & Platforms 5 Blockchain Projects That Are Increasing Our Freedom April 17, 2018 By Zoe Biehl As you likely already know, blockchain isn’t just all about investing in cryptocurrencies to make money. In fact, blockchain technology is a whole lot more—it’s completely transforming all kinds of industries and improving lives globally. Blockchain technology is even increasing our freedoms, from freedom of speech to our right to privacy. There are all sorts of inventive projects out there taking advantage of this new decentralized technology in order to make our world a more just and free place. Here, we highlight our 5 favorite freedom-loving projects. SelfKey Source: https://selfkey.org/ It’s become glaringly clear that our digital identities are not in our own hands—they’re being controlled and abused by giant corporations that making massive amounts of money at our expense. Since our private information is stored in huge centralized databases, security breaches are all too common. Surely you remember the Equifax hack last summer that resulted in the identities of 143 million people being stolen. That’s over 45% of the population of the United States! Recognizing the importance of solving this problem, the team behind SelfKey decided to create a solution to decentralize the management of our private information using blockchain. The problem with companies controlling millions of identities in one database is that all this sensitive information can be hacked at once by a single cybercriminal. These hackers have a huge incentive to break into a single large database, as they can make piles of money by selling the info on the black market. But if you decentralize the database among all users so that each person controls their own private information, cybercriminals can no longer obtain everyone’s data at once. They can only try to hack into a single person’s account, and the reward is very small. This is exactly what SelfKey has done. They are putting the power back into the hands of individuals, allowing each person to control their digital information, thus increasing their right to privacy. In the words of the team: It is a fundamental human right that an individual, not an outside company, decides what information to share, when to share it, and with whom to share it. Since SelfKey never stores your data, they can’t ever lose it to hackers or sell it to third parties. SelfKey will never profit by taking advantage of your private information, because they don’t actually have control over any of your information—only you do. The team believes the SelfKey Network is much more than just a place to securely store and share your encrypted data. As the SelfKey team put it: SelfKey matches the current and future needs of evolving modern societies and the global Internet, ensuring human rights and fundamental freedoms of identity are met. This isn’t just a lofty vision, either. SelfKey is actively testing the alpha version of their Identity Wallet right now, and the wallet is on track to be released to the public very soon. This is wonderful news for those who feel they have lost control over their personal information and want to take matters back into their own hands. Horizon State If a country is a true democracy, then every citizen should have the right to vote, and the government should ensure that elections are not rigged or tampered with. Seems like a no-brainer, but unfortunately, this is still a huge issue in today’s world. The world still relies on using paper ballots for our most important elections, which allows voter fraud to easily occur. Horizon State is a firm working to bring blockchain to the voting populace. The team has essentially created a secure digital ballot box that cannot be hacked, which means that results cannot be altered and voter identities are protected. The platform enables voting processes to be decentralized, autonomous, and far more convenient, since voters can participate right from their computer or phone. Investopedia wrote: Horizon’s secure digital ballot box represents a cost-effective and smart solution to the problems inherent in today’s voting procedures. Blockchain is paving the way for our voting privileges to be completely secure, ensuring our voices are heard. Substratum Did you know that a majority of the governments in the world are currently censoring the internet in some way? Freedom House—an NGO that conducts research and advocacy on democracy, political freedom, and human rights—has been releasing reports each year on the state of internet freedom in countries worldwide. In their most recent 2017 report, research concluded that only a dismal 23% of the world’s internet users have free, unrestricted, and uncensored internet access. Source: https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FOTN_2017_Full_Report.pdf Reporters Without Borders, an NGO that advocates freedom of the press, has published a list of countries that are “Enemies of the Internet,” which they explain are classified as so because “all of these countries mark themselves out not just for their capacity to censor news and information online but also for their almost systematic repression of Internet users.” Countries on this list include China, Russia, India, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia—and perhaps shockingly—the United States and the United Kingdom, among others. So what can blockchain do about this global problem of internet repression? What’s where Substratum comes in. Substratum is an open-source network that is allowing anyone in the world to allocate spare computing resources to decentralize the internet. Users can host websites or applications by running a node on the Substratum blockchain. These nodes forward content from hosts to web users around the world, and hosts running nodes get paid in cryptocurrency for helping support a decentralized internet. And even more importantly, people who live in places with censored internet can bypass their government’s restrictions and access whatever content they wish—without the need for VPNs or Tor. In the words of Substratum’s co-founder Justin Tabb: One day, Americans might wake up and realize they don’t like big brother watching over their shoulder and having corporations track everything they do. And when that happens, Substratum will be there. If you believe everyone deserves the freedom to access uncensored, unrestricted information and content on the web, consider learning more about Substratum and running a node on your own computer. The more people that participate, the more decentralized and free our internet can become. Sapien It’s no secret that the social media world has some serious problems. Fake Twitter bots are spreading propaganda and lies like wildfire. Our personal data is being collected and used by companies that turn around and sell it to the highest bidder, as we’ve most recently seen with Facebook allowing Cambridge Analytica to harvest the data of over 50 million users. Every day, we are allowing social media platforms to invade our privacy and profit from selling our data. A social media revolution is long overdue… but what can be done? The whole world isn’t just going to stop using social media. We need a new platform that truly serves its users instead of exploiting them. Sapien could be just the solution we need. Sapien is a democratized, tokenized, reputation-based social news platform that rewards millions of digital content creators without any centralized intermediaries. Even better, Sapien shares advertisement revenue with its users. In the words of the Sapien team: It is painfully clear that modern social news sites are both obsolete and dangerous. Sapien rewrites the social network experience to champion the user and the truth while leveraging the powerful capabilities of the blockchain. It will definitely be a difficult task to switch from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc., to a decentralized social media platform. Sapien’s platform is still in beta mode. Mass adoption of a decentralized social media platform seems unlikely any time soon, but it’s entirely possible that people will increasingly become more and more fed up with big corporations taking advantage of their information, and this will precipitate a move to something better. That something could possibly be Sapien, if the team can release a working decentralized social media platform for the masses. Fingers crossed that they do. DNN (Decentralized News Network) In case you haven’t noticed, today’s news is completely plagued by misinformation, sensationalistic clickbait, and unbalanced reporting. In the U.S., 90% of news coverage—whether it’s written content, television broadcasts, or radio—is controlled by just 6 gigantic media conglomerates. When all of the media you consume comes from the same 6 sources, chances are you aren’t getting the full, unbiased picture on any news story out there. These media companies are controlling the vast majority of what gets published and aired, which means they’re controlling how most of the public perceives current events. It’s pretty terrifying when you think about it. You should know by now that blockchain’s biggest superpower is decentralization, which is exactly what the news industry so desperately needs. DNN, short for Decentralized News Network, is working on just that. Their website states: Our mission is to create news content that is both empowering for its readers, as well as representative of the integrity of its writers. We aspire to become the most trusted and democratic news alternative to mainstream media. DNN aims to be a decentralized, collaborative news platform that provides factual content to its users. DNN is built on the Ethereum blockchain so that it can never be hacked into, taken down, or censored. They’ve created an extensive review process that allows fact-checkers to validate submitted content for overall accuracy and legitimacy, much like Wikipedia does. DNN involves readers, writers, reviewers, and publishers providing key contributions that make up the underlying functions and structure of the network. This means no one person or company is controlling the content—it’s a collaborative effort among all its users to ensure factual and thorough perspectives of current affairs are published on the platform. Everyone deserves free, factual news coverage to know what’s actually happening in the world. This is yet another example of how blockchain has the potential to completely transform our world for the better.

We take a look at these two platforms, the benefits of their partnership and its impact on blockchain adoption.","title":"The SelfKey and Polymath Partnership: KYC and Securities Can Prosper on the Blockchain","content":" AnalysisCryptocurrencies & Platforms The SelfKey and Polymath Partnership: KYC and Securities Can Prosper on the Blockchain February 24, 2018 By Abhimanyu Krishnan The cryptocurrency market is swirling with news of all kinds. A recent string of government regulations has rocked the market, while logical partnerships such as that announced by SelfKey and Polymath have boosted confidence. The current climate is so unpredictable that it renders involved investors more wary than ever before and potential investors confused as to if, where, and how they should make an entry. Even the strongest of coins, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and IOTA, are not safe when regulatory entities pass judgement, or when social media stirs itself into a frenzy. But partnerships between blockchain companies, like that between SelfKey and Polymath, announced in late January 2018, is a reassuring indication of things to come. Collaborations between projects serve as an antidote to the fear generated from the tinkerings and deliberations of authorities. They are a sign of growing stability, commercial value, and practical forms of working around the barriers of entry. They act as padding against volatility. Of course, it is undoubtedly true that price corrections in the crypto market are necessary, if overly brutal, occurrences, acting as extinguishers of the wildfire of hype that has grown since late last year. Corrections weed out those investors who endanger the future of the market by dabbling in it to make a quick buck, while being ignorant of the underlying technology, which holds far more importance than any one coin. The implications of such extreme corrections for the long-term prospects of the market are not good, however. Before we look in greater detail at the good example the SelfKey–Polymath partnership sets for the future of blockchain as a whole, let’s have a look at the effects of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (known colloquially as FUD) has on the marketplace and why the presence of spikes and corrections is ultimately a detriment to mass adoption. Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt The point in contention is that the market is undergoing unwarranted levels of volatility, triggered by unsteady investors reacting to the slightest whiff of negativity, sometimes even misconstruing events and sending shockwaves of panic through the market. This causes the kind of damage that stunts the growth and credibility of a market in the long run. The recent early panic at the announcement of the US Senate’s hearing on virtual currencies is an example of this. The first wave of responses to the hearing smacked of superficial understanding and wanton fearmongering. Clearly, it has come to the point where the word “regulation” cannot be disassociated from the idea of a government crackdown. One need only look at the viral spread of favourable memes featuring the speakers of the hearing, Jay Clayton and J. Christopher Giancarlo, to learn how high-strung the market is. However, Clayton and Giancarlo both agreed that cryptocurrency had its value and could empower the world. They noted that its technical aspects could make our economies more efficient. They supported the growth of the technology while advising rules to secure the safety of uninformed investors. What about all of this should generate fear, uncertainty, and doubt among crypto traders? A portion of the community, without applying reservation to their judgement, decided that it must be bad news from the get-go. The joy that followed the hearing, which was on the whole positive regarding the status of cryptocurrency, is no compensation for the panic that preceded it – this only further emphasizes how unpredictable the market can be. Cryptocurrency is mature enough by now that it should have reached some degree of stability. Slow and steady progress would be preferable to these manic-depressive swings of euphoria and depression. Such wild swings and irrational thought processes guiding much of the market are not the ideal tracks for cryptocurrency to take towards a recognizably global market cap. To think that sudden announcements, good or bad, and knee-jerk emotional reactions provide good medication or prognosis of the market is erroneous. This situation is comparable to the phenomenon of bloodletting in centuries past, a remedy we now know to be harmful and have replaced with better treatments, those grounded in reason and informed understanding. It is time for cryptocurrency stakeholders to adopt a more collected mindset, and employ better methods to treat and nourish the market so that it will ultimately prosper. The bloodletting and dog-eat-dog mentality of market surge, correction, and shake-out must be replaced by beneficial enterprise alliances and blockchain partnerships. Could Partnerships Add to the Credibility of Cryptocurrencies? There are several steps cryptocurrencies can take to win over the world, but none that would lead to more steady and permanent progress than partnerships with fellow projects. The properties of blockchain technology, namely that it does not discriminate on the basis of border or entity, and its ease of integration with other projects, make it suitable for openness and cooperation. What one project can offer to an industry, another can supplement with its own unique features. We should strive for a world where an ecosystem of blockchains cooperate with each for mutual prosperity, as opposed to competing with each other to the detriment of both the platform and the user. There’s another to point consider here: the enterprise market is an effective and durable way of staking your claim on a large portion of the market. Once businesses and micro-economies have opted for a platform(s) as their solution to business challenges, it takes a great deal of persuasion for them to migrate to a rival platform or software. Microsoft is an example of a company that perfectly executed this strategy. Windows has dominated the desktop OS market for nearly 30 years now and continues to hold, despite Apple’s upswing and the recent and modest success of Chrome OS. Similarly, there is potential for collaborative blockchain efforts to entrench themselves in key inter-industry markets, such as healthcare and insurance, trading and AI marketplaces, or cloud computing and software. This is just a smattering of the endless possibilities for partnerships. Like the 12 musical notes that can be combined to form an infinite number of chords, melodies, and scales, so too can blockchain projects be combined to form diverse and satisfying solutions to the problems of users, businesses and society. Success lies in working together, not against each other. The recent announcement that the blockchain platform SelfKey would partner up with Polymath sparked this realization. Both platforms are perfectly suited for each other’s services. They also operate in industries that have extreme revenue-generating possibilities. It is is this kind of thoughtful collaboration that gives us hope that the cryptocurrency market will eventually mature and stabilize. Let us examine how this partnership would benefit each platform and the end user. Before we do so, it would help if we understood the nature of each project. What is SelfKey? SelfKey is a digital identity system that allows individuals and companies to control, manage, and utilize personal data safely and conveniently. The idea behind the project was born in 2012, which the team says is a result of their frustration with redundancy of sensitive personal data – data is held on file far beyond its time of necessity, and by multiple providers – in corporate services businesses. It has benefited from multiple accelerators, including Accenture FinTech, SCB Digital Ventures, and SuperCharger accelerator. It is also working with Standard Chartered and has received a Regulatory Sandbox License. The necessity of blockchain for this particular use case is readily obvious. Our data is now predominantly stored, disseminated, and validated on digital systems. It is convenient, swift, and paperless, expediting and easing processing, much to the relief of administrative employees in industries that include banking, governance, telecom, healthcare, and insurance. “Know Your Customer” (KYC) norms are mandatory identification processes that financial institutions and governments must employ to combat money laundering. The digital sphere in its current state is vulnerable, as evinced by the string of recent hacks at Equifax, FedEx, and Uber. In the wake of the realization of blockchain’s potential for data storage and exchange, this imperfection in current digital data management systems has only further been highlighted. Personal data is a precious resource, more so than, or at least par with, our financial resources. It is easily exploitable by individuals, corporate greed, targeted advertising, and malicious hackers. Indeed, to a determined attacker, even Bitcoin’s supposed capability in masking transaction data is a minor irritation at best. Web trackers and cookies from the sites you visit play a critical part in discovering personal details behind transactions. Nor has the full capability of blockchain been leveraged until this point, including the utilization of smart contracts and tokens to enable end-to-end practical usages of personal data to be executed, such as the creation and verification of bank accounts. Blockchain makes it possible for any individual in the world, including the 2 billion that are unbanked, to obtain access to financial services – all without requiring the presence of a third party. The security and accessibility of personal data, which SelfKey encapsulates in their concept of “Self-Sovereign Identity,” is the key to banishing these problems. The platform provides for all digital data needs with the following: An identity wallet, composed of an individual’s ID attributes and their personal documents, which can be attested by governmental entities, notaries, and utility companies. This information can also be securely accessed by banks. The SelfKey marketplace, a digital portal where a user can apply for passports, claim citizenship through investment, create a bank account, avail of residency services, and more. The totality of services will cover exchanges, money transfers, credit cards, mortgages, loans, and airline tickets, and it consists of over 250 such services. SelfKey has already launched a demo of the marketplace, which can be interacted with here. They have stated that new services will periodically be released. The KEY token, which fuels the ecosystem. The purpose of the SelfKey platform is to create a safe and convenient KYC system for individuals, attesting authorities, and relying parties. Attesting authorities include governmental entities, notaries, and utility providers. Relying parties include financial institutions. To facilitate interaction between these stakeholders, the KEY token be the form of the fee that the user pays to attesting authorities and relying parties. In addition, corporations will be able to utilize the features of the platform to streamline large-scale corporate KYC processes with a multi-verification technique and a Corporate Identity Wallet. SelfKey’s intention is to allow individuals to reclaim control over their personal identities. What is Polymath? Polymath is a token platform for financial assets like bonds and stocks. Rather surprisingly, this segment of finance is still bereft of blockchain integration. Polymath’s purpose is to transform shareholders into “token holders,” helping companies transition into a new era where ICOs and public ledgers are the source and record of capital acquisition. Blockchain is ripe for introduction into traditional finance, and there is nothing to be lost. ICOs have shown themselves to be a resourceful means for raising capital, with over $4 billion being raised by various startups in the past 2 years. The magnitude of capital raised has attracted the attention of governments, who seek to regulate and tighten operations so as to prevent consumer fraud – which, to be fair, has happened far too frequently in the cryptocurrency space. In recent months, there has been a slew of government directives curtailing the freedom of the cryptocurrency market. The situation is similar to the American business landscape in the 1920s, when securities where sold on the promise of large returns but backed by misleading and false information. This resulted in the Great Crash of 1929. Polymath describes this in detail in their whitepaper. The apparent motivation of governments’ curtailing of crypto is to prevent disingenuous projects and ICOs from fleecing users who are ignorant about the technology in a market where no securities law exist. And while the public must be protected from outright theft, drastic blanket regulations suffocate the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, which also constitutes of numerous well-meaning and well-designed projects. In the traditional market, multiple laws have been enacted to protect consumers from risky investments. Businesses are required to make state filings, disclose financial information, undergo an extensive underwriting process, accept limits on how much capital can be raised, and study the profile of the investors. Liquidity in private markets is also poor, to the point where it obstructs trading. All of this goes to say that the regulations that have accumulated over the years, from the Securities Exchange Act of the 1930s to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, have made public offerings of securities by businesses an expensive, onerous, and time-consuming process. It is in the context of this scenario that Polymath comes in with its blockchain platform for securities. Up until now, in a centralized economy, we have depended upon governments and regulating entities to ensure that the public is protected from fraud and bad market practice. Blockchain, however, is a system that guarantees trust without the presence of a monitoring authority. It can be programmed such that both parties in a transaction are compelled to hold up their end of the bargain. Additionally, blockchain is well known for its potential in functioning as a global ledger, with reduced settlement times and costs, and the absence of middlemen. The openness of blockchain ledgers, which supports the idea of inter-project partnerships, is an upgrade from the systems of today, in which disjointed, closed-off systems must undergo long data transfers and verifications before transactions can be settled. Lastly, blockchain’s public ledgers are secure, transparent, and democratic. Specifically, Polymath’s goals are to provide a decentralized protocol for trading securities tokens, which, unlike currency-based tokens (like Bitcoin) or utility tokens (like BAT), offer the holder a stake in the company’s profits, should they grow in value. To open up to a larger pool of investors, Polymath will enable individuals and institutions to authenticate themselves, including their accreditation status, so that they can participate in Security Tokens Offerings (STOs). The POLY token powers the system and the operational workflow of security issues, KYC providers, investors, and legal delegates. The process is as follows: An issuer issues a security token, which is to be reviewed by a legal delegate. The latter can make a bid for the token, and the issuer chooses from among the various bids. Once the legal delegate has reviewed and approved of the security, the issuer can begin the trading process when ready. A smart contract is then created for the STO and the investor can purchase the security token. On the investor’s side, he or she chooses a KYC provider and pays them in POLY so that they can get whitelisted. When this happens, their Ethereum address is linked to their real identity, based on the documents provided. They can then purchase active security tokens and sell them to other whitelisted investors. Polymath will also feature multiple marketplaces: one for KYC providers, a second for legal delegates, and a third for developers. The developer marketplace will let them bid for smart contract developer jobs that an issuer of an STO might list. Benefits of the SelfKey-Polymath Partnership The CEO of Polymath, Trevor Koverko, has said: Working with a project like SelfKey is paramount to achieving our goals. Our mission is to guide companies through every step of a securities token launch. One of the steps, and a key focal area for us, is KYC. And KYC is the role that SelfKey will play, while Polymath focuses on securities offerings. Since the latter is so strictly tied to authenticity and disclosure, this partnership is an ideal collaboration. We can expect at the very least the following benefits: Accelerated Wall Street Adoption of Blockchain Although the world of investing is changing, Wall Street is still the most influential name. And they are indeed adopting the blockchain, having noted its potential. Polymath has also teamed up with tZERO to bring blockchain to Wall Street. The securities regulations which are embedded into Polymath’s securities tokens could entice Wall Street participants, and the KYC services of SelfKey will only further catalyze adoption by big names. This whole ecosystem is shaping up to be an easy way for any and all companies to deploy their securities on blockchain – comprehensive, secure, and with end-to-end services catered to. Rapid Capital Raising Opportunities For Small Businesses It is well known at this point that blockchain technology supports the individual and the small business. It allows both to receive funds and interact with a larger audience without the need to spend capital, actions which have previously only been accessible to large corporations. The internet has reduced this problem to a certain degree, but advertising and outreach still remain a problem. A partnership of this kind makes it possible for a small business to easily raise capital – and to succeed purely on the basis of their idea, product, or service. Polymath’s primary purpose is to let businesses raise capital in a secure manner. They will do so by having their securities verified and deployed on the platform, which can be bought with securities tokens. It is similar to how fundraising functions in the real world, but with all of the benefits of blockchain, eliminating the need for a lot of time, effort, and money. The KYC streamlining for corporations will be behind this benefit. A Marriage of Marketplaces At the center of both projects is their marketplace, a distribution platform for various services and businesses to make themselves accessible to the public. SelfKey’s KYC-oriented services and Polymath’s finance-oriented sales will ease entry into financial securities for both investors and businesses. The time-consuming task of getting personal data verified through KYC processes can be accelerated through SelfKey for both parties. In addition, businesses are likely to see increased involvement from the public because they can be linked to SelfKey, as a service, through the Polymath. While there is no indication that the partnership will result in this, any legal services that require KYC verification can also be provided on SelfKey through Polymath, which, as we mentioned, has established a space for legal delegates to ply their services. The result of this is that many of the services and processes of the platforms are suited for cross-application, and that makes it easier for users to avail of the host of finance-related services on SelfKey (whether securities or not), while gaining access to the legal and development services on Polymath. Conclusion The partnership between these two projects is truly a match made in heaven. They both complement each other’s services, and through blockchain’s salient features of having lower transaction fees and oversight built into the protocol, they can achieve their targets with increased success and reduced costs. Such partnerships are what will be required for blockchain to take the next step into global acceptance and truly flourish. This is the kind of positive news that must be highlighted and discussed deeply. The health of the market is dependent upon the confidence and understanding of its investors. Partnerships offer two significant benefits. First, they help create a stable ecosystem in which businesses can more fluidly collaborate with each other, bolstering revenue, employment, innovation, and, as a result of all of that, the general economy. Secondly, they inspire the investor market, which when it comes to cryptocurrency are far less educated in the matter than their stock market counterparts, to more keenly consider and evaluate the potential of blockchain technology, thereby serving to educate people and hopefully prevent them from making decisions based on fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Cryptocurrency is still ripe for great gains – it is yet to take off, whatever Bitcoin’s price charts might say. There is no need to feel regret about having missed out – there is still plenty of time to get in before the real gains manifest themselves. Many wonderfully thought-out coins are excellent investment choices, but to make the most of it we must study, discuss, and encourage the stability that partnerships bring. We cannot sit back and continue contributing to market volatility. We must understand that the crypto world must support each other and cooperate if it intends to survive. Governments, having taken notice of Bitcoin’s rise, are now directing their attention to cryptocurrencies. This will undoubtedly result in varying degrees of regulation, and for the market to continue to flourish, we must collectively participate in distributing relevant and accurate information to the less informed. We must, as the saying goes, HODL, no matter what chaos and hysteria the internet is selling us. And as cryptocurrency markets stabilize over the course of 2018, more blockchain companies will hopefully take inspiration from SelfKey and Polymath, and we will see more partnerships like theirs in the works.

The question of where your hard-earned money should go remains, and will continue to be answered differently depending what you’re looking for, and who you ask. The safest bet in one of the riskiest markets around is sussing out the projects that are solving “hair on fire” problems, then watching them all like a hawk. Before jumping into this article, it’s only right to mention that in terms of long-term investments, all the truly useful ERC-20 tokens are going to be undervalued in the current bear market. Also, since the advent of the Ethereum platform, creating your own cryptocurrency became significantly easier. This has led to, in my opinion, a large number of tokens that will end up being worthless in the not-so-distant future. Bearing that in mind, here are 5 ERC-20 tokens that are currently undervalued, given their long-term potential. Top Undervalued ERC-20 Tokens 0x Protocol (ZRX) What is 0x Protocol? The 0x protocol is an open-source, decentralized exchange (DEX) that’s been designed specifically for ERC-20 tokens to be traded on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The most popular exchanges currently operating are centralized, so in efforts to remain true to pure blockchain principles, 0x is aiming to be the top DEX for ERC-20 tokens. Founded in October 2016 by Will Warren and Amir Bandeali, the duo set out to create a future of tokenized finances that are able to be traded without the high fees and privacy concerns of centralized exchanges. It’s also worth noting that the 0x protocol was designed to allow Ethereum-based dapps to easily offer an exchange function. At the same time, all dapps using the 0x protocol are directly connected, which in turn could increase ERC-20 token liquidity. Why ZRX is Undervalued No Gas Fees on Off-Chain Orders Unlike other ERC-20 DEXs like IDEX and EtherDelta, the 0x protocol offers off-chain order books, which allows traders to avoid the gas fees required for buying, selling, placing orders, depositing, and withdrawing. While these fees are fairly low for long-term investors, they add up quickly for professional day traders. In order to keep the order books off-chain, the 0x protocol relies on relayers, which broadcast the off-chain orders to the 0x network. The relayers don’t execute the trades, but rather facilitate them by submitting the order to the network. Once the trade is complete, fees are paid in ZRX, 0x’s native token, and the transaction is written into Ethereum’s blockchain. Since the 0x protocol uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm, the ZRX token can also be staked and used to vote for future developments of the platform. Established Protocol Adoption Use case and public adoption are the bread and butter of long-term crypto investments. That is, of course, if the usage continues steadily. The 0x protocol is off to a strong start, and is already live with more than 30 dapps and relayers using their solution. Some of the more notable dapps and relayers are: Dapps Augur Dharma Maker Request Network Relayers Dextroid Ethfinex The Ocean For a complete list of dapps and relayers that are, or will be using the 0x protocol, click here. Coinbase Now Supports ZRX Within 24 hours of the time of writing, Coinbase officially announced that ZRX will be the first Ethereum-based token to be supported by Coinbase Pro. Coinbase has recently updated their token listing process, which was designed to greatly expand their offerings. Among the 5 tokens they began exploring in July 2018, ZRX was the first to make the cut. Possibly Integrating New Chains The 0x protocol has currently restricted their services to ERC-20 tokens, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be restricting the future of the platform to Ethereum. While focusing on ERC-20 tokens might be the best way to launch their DEX, the integration of other chains in the future is one decision that will be based on the staked voting power of ZRX token holders. ZRX is priced at $0.737 at the time of writing, and is ranked 25 in terms of market cap. IOST (IOST) What is IOST? IOST stands for Internet of Services Token, and they’re setting out to solve one of the most prominent problems within the crypto industry: scalability. The IOST team managed to raise $40 million by the end of their ICO in early 2018. Despite the impressive technological problem they’re tackling, they’ve actually managed to stay ahead of their original roadmap by several months. Co-founded by a team of 6, IOST has established their presence globally, with offices in China, Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and the USA. Their entire team has grown to include more than 50 blockchain experts, enabling a meeting of academic minds from Harvard, Princeton, Berkley, Uber, Google, and Morgan Stanley — just to name a few. Why IOST is Undervalued Novel Consensus Algorithm Aside from the impressive team that’s congregated around this project, what sets IOST apart from competitors like Zilliqa and EOS is the suite of software technology they’ve created to accomplish their end goal of secure, scalable blockchain solutions. Commonly used consensus algorithms like Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) have traditionally left gaps between where the market stands today, and a global mass adoption event. PoW blockchains like Bitcoin remain widely decentralized, but end up bulky and slow. PoS blockchains are typically much faster, but present the risk of centralization. This lead IOST to a novel approach they call Proof-of-Believability (PoB). Simply put, there are 2 types of IOST nodes, Believable Nodes and Normal Nodes. Believable Nodes allow for fast transactions, and are constantly reviewed and given a “Believability Rating.” Normal Nodes are responsible for verifying each transaction made by Believable Nodes, as well as establishing Believability Ratings. In order to support their PoB consensus algorithm, the IOST technical whitepaper outlines 4 more protocols that are designed to ensure the security and scalability of their network, most notably their Efficient Distributed Sharding (EDS) protocol. It’s worth noting that IOST supports JavaScript, which has been the most popular programming language for the last 6 consecutive years, making it east for the largest population of coders in the world to experiment with blockchain. For more details on their groundbreaking technology, be sure to read their whitepaper, and check out our article called What is IOST? Strong Token Economics When a blockchain startup has a token and finds success, it doesn’t automatically mean the price of their native token will rise as well. That’s why strong token economics and incentivized use of their native token is something for all investors to look for while doing their due diligence. The IOST token has been woven into the ecosystem in a variety of ways. It can be used as a payment for goods and services purchased on the platform, or for commision and transaction fees within the ecosystem. Source: IOST.io As previously detailed, the PoB system is IOST’s solution to the scalability problem. If they’re successful in solving this problem, their platform has the opportunity to be widely used. Another role that the IOST token plays lies within the calculation of Believability Ratings, which makes the IOST token an integral part of their protocol, and could tie IOST’s price to its success. The Team is Ahead of Schedule IOST’s original roadmap, created after their early 2018 ICO, estimated their first public testnet would be released in Q1 2019. On October 1st, 2018, IOST officially announced the second iteration of their tesnet was now live. Moreover, the originally scheduled release date for their public mainnet was during Q3 2019, which has now been pushed forward to Q1 2019. Roadmaps aren’t supposed to be set in stone, which is usually in order to give startups extra time to navigate unexpected delays. The IOST team bucking the industry trend of delayed releases speaks volumes for their team’s ability to deliver on their vision. IOST is priced at $0.011 at the time of writing, and is ranked 63rd in terms of market cap. OmiseGo (OMG) What is OmiseGo? Founded in Bangkok, Thailand in 2013, Omise started out as a payment gateway for individuals and businesses across Asia. The company has since grown to list over 80 employees on their website, with offices in Thailand, Japan, Singapore, and Indonesia. In June 2017, Omise hosted an ICO event for their cryptocurrency, OmiseGo, where they raised $27 million. Staying true to their slogan “Unbank the Banked,” the OmiseGo team has been working hard to allow anyone to send money anywhere in the world — without needing a bank account. Sending money across borders in Southeast Asia has become a slow, unreliable process, and there are many unbanked members of the population using cash as a primary means of payment. Successful integration of the OmiseGo platform would allow for simple monetary exchange, while tapping the unbanked into the online global economy. Why OMG is Undervalued Their Target Demographic is Large and Tech Savvy Operating in multiple South East Asian countries allows OmiseGo to expand into a rapidly growing economy. According to WorldBank, as of 2018, only 27% of South East Asians had bank accounts despite there being a massive workforce and educated population. While most have been forced to stash their fiat at home, with the explosion of cheap smartphones and the advent of payment apps that can be “topped up” (add funds to your account with cash at a store), the unbanked have found their way around bank accounts. As someone who lives in Southeast Asia, I’ve seen QR codes at plenty of cash registers. The gap between fiat and crypto looks much smaller from this angle. Integrated Platform Features Once complete, the OmiseGo platform will offer a wide array of services for their users. Even though they’re focusing on the end user, they’re building a system that provides other tech companies a platform to operate on top of. Focusing on the wholesale side of blockchain technology gives OMG an opportunity to scale quickly. Source: OmiseGO.network Software Development Kits (SDK) — Although their slogan is somewhat combative, OmiseGo does plan to work with existing financial institutions alongside other crypto projects moving forward. This has led them to create white label SDK, which allows crypto wallet providers to connect to the OMG network. This enables their users to trade both crypto and fiat assets, as well as top up with debit cards, credit cards, and designated ATMs. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) — Right now, if you’re able to use Coinbase, it’s fairly easy to get involved in cryptocurrencies. The problem is, Coinbase is a centralized exchange, which directly contradicts the principles of blockchain technology. This has given OmiseGo, and many others, the opportunity to build decentralized exchanges. While at first it might seem a bit overambitious to include, the OmiseGo DEX would likely serve the entire network regularly, allowing OmiseGo users to tap into an in-house exchange that allows for trading both Bitcoin and Ethereum assets. Furthermore, as part of the Proof-of-Stake network, staked OMG will validate DEX transactions. With incentive to hold OMG, less of the asset is available, encouraging an increase in demand, and therefore, price. OMG is priced at $3.07 at the time of writing, and is ranked 24th in terms of market cap. WaltonChain (WTC) What is WaltonChain? The Chinese-Korean company was founded in November 2016 with the intent to solve the centralization problem found within the growing Internet of Things (IoT). Under a centralized structure, the autonomous exchange of information between objects cannot take place unless they’re a part of the same network. By using a combination of blockchain databases and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) mechanisms, Waltonchain is building what they describe as the Value Internet of Things (VIoT). Just like humans are being globally connected with distributed ledger technology, so too will our vehicles, cell phones, and refrigerators. With a decentralized network, manufacturers will be able to completely track their supply chain, trace their sources, and authenticate products. By doing so, the safety and transparency of manufactured products can be measured and improved, while latent consumer needs can be identified and served with greater ease. Why WTC is Undervalued IoT Industry Leaders RFID chips are used to transmit data, and they’ve been in the market for quite some time. You can find them in hotel key cards, in the fast lane of highway tolls, or implanted into global supply chains. One of the biggest problems preventing the interconnection of our electronic devices with RFID technology is that the RFID chips currently in production are too expensive, and not secure enough to integrate with blockchain tech. This has led the WaltonChain team to manufacture their own patented technology, which allows them to source inexpensive, more secure, and more powerful chips in-house. By infusing blockchain principles within the manufacturing process, each chip is unique and foolproof, complete with their own set of public and private keys. By keeping hardware production and blockchain development in-house, WaltonChain is giving themselves a competitive advantage against competitors using outsourced hardware. In fact, in June 2018, the initial iteration of their RFID chips were being mass produced. Significant Partnerships in a Growing Industry While WaltonChain hasn’t had the marketing success as other supply chain cryptos (like VeChain for example), they have positioned themselves well within their surrounding environments. Over the last couple years, the WaltonChain team has established high-level partnerships throughout Asia. For example, they’re currently partnered with the massive e-commerce company Alibaba, and are currently working on projects with the Chinese government. All these partnerships are being made within the IoT industry, which is predicted to see serious growth within the next decade. It’s difficult to put a number on where IoT will go in the near future in terms of price and usage, although many have tried. It’s easy to see the common theme among IoT reports: they expect more devices to be connected, and more money to be involved in the coming years. WTC is priced at $2.99 at the time of writing, and is ranked 56th in terms of market cap. Basic Attention Token (BAT) What is Basic Attention Token? Basic Attention Token was created to give users the ability to use the internet for free — without sacrificing their personal information and attention. The token itself would be exchanged among content producers, consumers, and advertisers, creating a mutually beneficial relationship between them. As it currently stands, there is an interconnected relationship between publishers, advertisers, and users of websites like Facebook and YouTube. The advertiser pays the publisher (and the platform) a fee to advertise their goods and services. The platform collects the user information in order to target advertisements, which allows them to charge advertisers more money. The user gets to consume the content free of charge, but is required to pay attention and give away their privacy. Source: BAT website The current system works, but it has its disadvantages. Since the platform facilitating all of this is centralized, content producer and consumer attention/data is constantly being mined and sold to advertisers in order to turn a profit. By introducing a decentralized reward mechanism complete with “anonymity shields,” users are rewarded for their attention, publishers are rewarded for their viewership, and advertisers are able to target their audience better. Why BAT is Undervalued Their Web Browser is Fantastic The entire BAT concept is facilitated by use of the Brave Browser. Brave is a free, open-source web browser that automatically blocks advertisements and cookies. By eliminating unwanted data from your load times, Brave is twice as fast as Chrome, and up to 8 times faster than mobile web browsers. Since the launch of their first iteration in January 2016, the Brave Browser has been downloaded more than 10 million times in the Google Play Store alone, and boasts over 4 million active users. In 2009, Internet Explorer accounted for 65% of web browser usage. Less than 10 years later, they’ve basically switched places with Google Chrome, and now only see about 2.8% of web browser usage. The switch from Internet Explorer to Google Chrome was a clear decision for myself, and many others, simply because it was faster. Since Brave makes it easy to import bookmarks and passwords from other popular web browsers, the switch is quick and painless. You can try Brave today by clicking here. The BAT Team Knows Their Stuff After raising $35 million dollars during their 30-second ICO in summer 2017, the team got to work implementing their strategy. It is definitely worth noting that the founder, strategist, and visionary for this project is extremely suited for the job. Brendan Eich is the creator of JavaScript, which is the most popular programming language in 2018, a title that’s been maintained for the last 6 consecutive years. To add to that, he’s also the co-founder of Mozilla, and their web browser, Firefox. BAT is priced at $0.176 at the time of writing, and is ranked 45th in terms of market cap.

But as the “3.0” indicates, the internet is evolving from something into something else. In this article, we take a look at the transition of the internet from its humble beginnings to getting taken over by tech giants, and how blockchain technology has an important role to play in the evolution of the Web. We then focus on the main web-based industries – blockchain projects in particular – that have set out to disrupt the status quo and lead the Web to its 3.0 stage. From Web 1.0 to 3.0 First, there was the Web 1.0, better known as the World Wide Web. Most of us remember those early days when you had to dial up the internet and sit through the noisy process. Websites were static, took forever to load, and a page like MySpace wasn’t even possible yet. As more people started using the internet and began to recognize its potential, a new global infrastructure to support the World Wide Web emerged. The internet became faster and allowed for heavier applications and websites, giving rise to the era of social media, YouTube, Amazon, Airbnb, Netflix, and Bitcoin. Today, people across the globe can share information and entertainment, shop, get answers to all their questions, and interact with each other, all on the Web 2.0. According to estimates, 54.4% of the global population has access to the internet. Source: https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm However, the Web 2.0 has several limitations. Data is the new oil. Everything we do online is potential data, and internet-based companies are collecting more and more of it. Our personal data is so valuable because it provides free information that businesses can use to market themselves and potentially reach over half of the world. Your data is fast becoming one of the most valuable assets you have, and you don’t even own it. Mega enterprises such as Facebook and Google became Facebook and Google by harvesting nearly immeasurable amounts of data from their users. For these web conglomerates, users have become their product and businesses their customers – and they know virtually everything about their product. Today, the main business model of nearly every large internet company is based on the collection and sale of its users’ data. Source: http://geekfolk.blogspot.com/2015/11/whos-selling-your-data.html On top of that, nearly all organizations using the internet collect data, and not all of them with the end goal of trading it. For example, governments, banks, and credit card companies own an enormous amount of data with no intentions of selling it. There is one big issue with this, however: it’s extremely hard to store data securely. Click here for a full overview of the biggest data breaches in history. Additionally, it goes without saying that we cannot trust each other on the internet. How do I know that my distant cousin from Zimbabwe is really my distant cousin, and that they’re actually sending me my royal inheritance? For the identification of parties and verification of transactions, we still need intermediaries on the Web 2.0 to collect and store our data, and here we go again. The Web 3.0 The dominance of the internet giants has ruined the dream of full freedom of information and opinion that once accompanied the emergence of the internet. And just as things started to get out of hand, with Facebook’s data being used for voter manipulation, Google storing much more data than Facebook, Uber getting hacked, among many, many other issues, a solution presented itself in the form of blockchain technology and the Web 3.0. Blockchain technology sparked the Web 3.0 transition by making several things possible that weren’t before. Thanks to the technology’s decentralized nature, there are no central parties controlling entire platforms. Each network member partly controls a particular blockchain, and together all network members decide the on the future of the platform. Data is stored across the network, meaning there are no central servers anymore – and thus no central points of entry – making data storage vastly more secure. Hackers would have to hack an entire blockchain, which cannot be done with our existing technology. Decentralized data storage also means no more selling, manipulating, and surveilling of user data by central parties. All user data that is collected via blockchain is fully encrypted, and the rules of conduct on what to do with this data are transparently written in the blockchain’s programming. Moreover, blockchain platforms allow users to retain ownership of their data, rather than hand it over to be hoarded by all-too-powerful tech giants. We can keep it private, or maybe share it with advertisers in return for micropayments. Advertisers have always been paying millions to get their products known to the public, and they will keep doing so – just directly to the users rather than to third parties like Facebook. Because all transactions are stored on a decentralized, shared ledger, blockchain is inherently transparent. The entire community can see transactions appearing on the blockchain, check wallets, and access the programming of the blockchain, without knowing who owns what and who is who. Everybody is included in the Web 3.0 because of the permissionless nature of most blockchains. This means that no one needs to get permission to use it. Anyone can open up a Bitcoin wallet, make a Steemit account, and start using a dapp on the Ethereum blockchain. Projects Leading the Web 3.0 Evolution The transition from Web 2.0 to 3.0 will likely happen smoothly, without being noticed by the masses. The Web 3.0 applications will look and feel the same as the 2.0 applications we use today, but the back-end will be designed completely differently. Siacoin will just be seen as a cheaper Cloud storage alternative, Steemit as a social media platform on which people can directly exchange content for value, and Augur as a fun way to bet on future events. As soon as the first killer application of blockchain emerges, we’ll likely see the beginning of the global exodus from 2.0 to 3.0. Developers will have a clear example of how to balance blockchain technology with the user friendliness of the Web 2.0, and slowly everything will transition. In the following segment, we will look at various segments and companies on the Web 2.0 and see which blockchain projects are getting ready to disrupt the incumbents and lead to the 3.0 evolution. Digital Payments The majority of our online payments are conducted through the use of intermediaries in the form of credit card companies (VISA, MasterCard), banks, and PayPal. These organizations have the responsibility to ensure the funds actually move hands, keep all the private information secure, and prevent any form of theft. For all this, these organizations incur massive overhead costs. Keeping data centers and capital secure while also making profits results in hefty transaction fees for users of these organizations’ services. Cryptocurrencies meant for transactions solve a lot of these security concerns and dramatically decrease the cost, due to their lack of third party involvement. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, and Zcash are all examples of secure digital currencies that can be quickly and cheaply sent around the globe. All users need is access to the internet and a device to keep their wallet on. For merchants, companies like Bitpay help them integrate cryptocurrencies into their payment system. But coming back to the concept of a smooth transition, it is likely that most people will use the Web 3.0 without knowing it, thus without actually using cryptocurrencies. Using PayPal, your bank account, or a credit card is much easier than creating accounts and trading on crypto exchanges, keeping your private keys secure, and keeping a cool head in the face of market volatility. Stellar Lumens is a blockchain company that is committed to disrupting the digital payments industry by connecting banks, payment systems, and end-users. The platform allows for quick, reliable, and low cost global transactions. These transactions don’t necessarily have to be in crypto, but can be any fiat currency. Stellar Lumens users won’t even realize that cryptocurrencies were involved in the process, even though on the back-end these transactions run on Stellar’s native cryptocurrency, XLM. Another project devoted to transactions is the Request Network, often mentioned as a serious competitor of PayPal. The platform allows anyone anywhere to make payment requests. These payments are conducted on the blockchain, eliminating the need for intermediary parties and making the payments fully secured. The team behind the Request Network understands that most people do not want to have to deal with cryptocurrencies yet, and they have implemented mechanisms that allow payment requests to work with every global currency. By leveraging blockchain technology, the Request Network has a serious competitive advantage, because transactions on the platform can be done for far lower fees than with any other industry player. Social Media Even though we keep using the popular social media platforms en masse, most users realize something is broken in their business models. Facebook has dominated headlines with their recent data scandal, but other cases like Instagram’s and Twitter’s manipulative mechanisms, as well as their completely broken advertisement model, are becoming more clear to the public. The key issue here is that the data collected by these online giants is highly sensitive due to its personal nature, and it can result in gross invasions of privacy. You don’t want your friends going through your entire browser history, let alone some distant online conglomerate who not only tracks your data, but also makes entire profiles of you based on your data, which it then sells. And yet, cats are so damn cute, and we still want our phone to entertain us and help us keep in touch with distant friends. We can’t abandon social media; we just need a much better model for running it. The Steem blockchain, and its best known social media application Steemit, lead the way in this segment of the Web 3.0 evolution. The Steemit platform has employed its own economic model in which creators of content are curated by their peers. Quality content gets upvoted, and each upvote represents a microtransaction of Steem, the platform’s native currency. The platform is ad-free, no user data is centrally stored or sold, there is no censorship of content by a central organization, and users are awarded cryptocurrency for being active on the platform and improving the quality of its content. Steemit is the leading application on the Steem blockchain, but there are more applications like DTube, a YouTube alternative, and dMania, a decentralized 9GAG. The success of Steemit has given rise to some healthy competition. Narrative (a beautiful website) is a NEO-based competitor. It employs a similar dynamic to Steemit, but there is more governance by users who can own topic niches. Narrative also dedicates a part of its website to brands which can make themselves known to the platform through quality content. There is also Sapien, a democratic and social news platform; Indorse, an Ethereum-based alternative to LinkedIn; and ONG.social that focuses more on privacy – and these are just a few of a growing number of blockchain-based social media platforms. Entertainment Besides social media, we turn to companies such as YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify for most of our daily entertainment. However, these mega companies have taken their markets by storm, leaving little room for competition. This has turned out to be a good thing for the companies, as they can collect and sell massive amounts of data, but a bad thing for the creators of content. Users publish their content on these platforms in hopes of having a shot at making a name for themselves, but receive very little in return for the value they create. Additionally, there has been a lot of critique on YouTube’s questionable censorship and monetization policy, Spotify’s payments to the musicians on its platform, and Netflix’s unmatched power over the movie and series industry. In this segment of the Web-based industry, there are plenty of blockchain initiatives willing to disrupt it. The music industry has been haunted by bad deals for artists and exploitation by labels, and musicians are taking the initiative to change this. Musician Imogen Heap, for example, started her own blockchain project Mycelia to make the distribution of value in the music industry more fair, especially when it comes to the creators of music. Voise is a similar platform which has set out to create a decentralized platform for music, directly connecting artists with their fans. Flixxo is an Ethereum-based application willing to dethrone YouTube, and, as mentioned earlier, DTube is the Steem-based blockchain competitor. Another serious candidate is Videocoin, a startup that managed to attract $35 million during its ICO, which is creating a decentralized platform for all kinds of video applications, ranging from video content to live streams to news channels. Storage Cloud storage is one of the great solutions that the Web 2.0 introduced to the world. Individuals and companies alike could suddenly cheaply store far more and larger files than their own hardware allowed for, and these files could be accessed from anywhere. However, even though cloud storage has major advantages, the fact that all stored data is in the hands of a centralized party is a problem. This is because it has a single point of failure, no matter how well-secured the cloud storage centers are. The data is held by one entity, and so compromising this entity is all it would take to get your hands on huge amounts of sensitive data. So let’s decentralize cloud storage too. In terms of market cap, Siacoin is the biggest company in this segment. This startup allows people with excess storage capacity to rent it out in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. Siacoin has proved to be much cheaper than Amazon and Google’s storage services, and based on their road map, we can expect some serious growth. Another startup decentralizing storage is Filecoin. This company managed to attract $257 million in ICO funding, making it one of the biggest ICOs ever. Filecoin’s decentralized network reliably stores files at hypercompetitive prices. A third big player in this part of the Web 3.0 evolution is Storj, a comparable decentralized Cloud storage platform with low prices and high security, in which only the user has access to his or her data. Online Advertisements Our current online advertisement model is broken. This is not only demonstrated by companies such as Facebook and YouTube, but also by most websites you visit. Running a professional website is serious business, which requires investments and paying costs, but as soon as a website starts asking for subscriptions, most people turn to other sources. By far the most employed practice is allowing advertisements to run on your website, and the more traffic you generate the more advertisers are willing to pay. However, people have become selectively blind when it comes to advertisements. What’s more, most people aren’t even viewing the ads, given the number of adblock downloads. Even the company profiting the most from ads, Google, has an adblock extension on its native browser. What if people could directly show their appreciation for website content, get paid by advertisers for watching their ads, and websites could stay profitable based on the contributions of its visitors? There are several blockchain startups working on this. The biggest project is Basic Attention Token. This Ethereum-based blockchain application has made it its mission to directly connect content creators, advertisers, and content consumers with each other without centralized organizations acting as intermediaries. In order to do this, the company has created its very own browser, the Brave browser. Through this browser, users are able to pay microtransactions towards content they enjoyed, and advertisers can pay content consumers for their attention. All of this will be done anonymously. Another company that is trying to change the online advertisement model is Oyster Pearls. This company is trying to create an engine through which content consumers can contribute GPU and CPU to websites they love, making those websites less dependent on advertisement. Moreover, it allows websites and content creators to store their data on a decentralized platform, which is ultimately cheaper and more secure. Running the Internet There is one larger project that is trying to decentralize the entire internet, called Substratum. Their platform makes it possible for anyone to contribute spare computing resources to a fully decentralized web which no authoritarian organization can censor or control. For running a Substratum and thus keeping the decentraweb online, users are paid with Substratum’s native cryptocurrency. Users of this internet can see the hosted content in their regular browser without any intermediaries interfering with their experience, thus creating a completely neutral and censorship-resistant internet. Imagine what this can mean for people being oppressed by authoritarian governments! Concluding Remarks There are many more projects working to bring the Web 2.0 to its next evolutionary stage, but in this article we focused on projects that are leading the evolution to the Web 3.0. Blockchain-based projects that aim to lead the Web 3.0 evolution are focused on smoothening the transition. Instead of forcing people to use entirely new systems, these projects are creating platforms that are similar to Web 2.0 solutions, but that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology. First we need a smooth transition from the Web 2.0 to the Web 3.0, in order to introduce people to the benefits of blockchain technology without exposing them to the downsides that exist because of the technology’s infancy. Slowly but surely, people will start to get accustomed to the dynamics of the blockchain-based Web, and then more complex applications will be introduced. The Web 3.0 promises to make the internet a fairer platform on which value is distributed to those who create it, a platform that promises to give the power back to those who deserve it – the users of the internet. However, it’s important to keep in mind that people had the same idea when the internet itself emerged. Those who developed the Web envisioned a future in which the whole world was connected, allowing for a free, global exchange of information and value. This dream was slowly swallowed whole by behemoths who consolidated control of the internet, and who now store and sell all their users’ information. A censorship-free internet is an ideology of the past, but blockchain technology has given new life to this dream. The Web 3.0 could transform the internet into what we wanted it to be in the first place: a global network in which each member can create value and be rewarded for it, without being treated as a product. Let’s see how far these blockchain startups can bring us to this ideal. Related: 5 Blockchain Projects That Are Increasing Our Freedom Download the Brave Browser.

{"url":"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-can-learn-from-cryptokitties/","web_url":"https://www.investinblockchain.com/","type":"article","description":"","title":"What We Can Learn From Cryptokitties","content":" EthereumNews What We Can Learn From Cryptokitties December 11, 2017 By Jorn van Zwanenburg It’s the latest buzz in the blockchain world and they are completely different from what you might expect in the crypto space: Cryptokitties. Yes, we’re using the Ethereum blockchain now to enjoy, breed and trade digital cats. The game launched on November 28, and the number of users has exploded over the weekend. With people making real Ethereum by selling their precious cats, questions arise as to how these cats can be of any value. The logic behind the prices of these binary cats actually teaches us a lot about the value of blockchain cryptos and tokens. Moreover, Cryptokitties has shown the blockchain space can be used much more than it was intended for. Why Do Cryptokitties Have Value? So, what do you do with Cryptokitties? Well, you collect pictures of cats. Not only does the whole world love cats, but the game is not as dull as it sounds since you can actually breed the cats. Every single cat is unique and you can combine the special features of each cat by letting them breed. The kittens will be even cuter, and so on, until some people can’t resist the urge to spend their Ether on them. Important to know is that there is a limited amount of cats, like a cryptocurrency. Moreover, each cat has its own unique mathematical identity and can’t be accessed without the private key. Because of this, cats are scarce and truly unique. Assume everyone gets two kittens, and those kittens get kittens. This means that the Adam and Eve of the crypto cats become pretty rare to come by. Our inherent but often hidden human desire to collect things was triggered once again and a marketplace arose. Because of their desirability, unique features and the limited supply, the Cryptokitties have been valued by the market. This has lead to a serious Cryptokitty market on which the digital cats are traded. Reportedly, the most expensive cat sold to date was worth 246 Ether, or $115.000. Nearly 50,000 cats have been sold and a little over $6.5 million has gone through the Ethereum-based game. Cryptokitties are Tokens Every Cryptokitty is a non-divisible Ethereum-based crypto token. This makes Cryptokitties the first real-world simple alternative use to crypto coins and token. It has very simply demonstrated that a token can mean much more than a financial value. They can also represent a collectible item of a limited supply, such as baseball cards, paintings or antique. By using cryptography and blockchain, the ownership of the underlying asset is ensured and the assets have a unique and logarithmically-protected identity. No more fake special edition Pikachu cards! A practical example of how cryptographic tokens can be used is an upcoming experiment in the Netherlands, where they’re trying to put social allowances on the blockchain. Instead of receiving a monthly allowance in money, eligible citizens receive a collection of several different tokens. These tokens can only be spent on what they’re supposed to be spent on. One bread token is one bread. What Cryptokitties also demonstrates is the effect of a limited supply. If there was an unlimited amount of Cryptokitties, there would have been no urge to buy the cards right away. New “Adam and Eve” cats could be created and new features could be added unlimitedly. The fact that there’s a finite amount of cats convinces people to buy them now, before they’re too expensive. Yes, we’re still talking about digital cats here, with close to zero intrinsic value. However, imagine that the cats actually have a lot of value. If you come across something like that in its early stage, you’ll most likely buy a few. This is because a finite amount implies that when the supply is dried up and the demand increases, prices can only go up. Finally, because Cryptokitties, like almost all cryptocurrencies, is decentralized, there is no central party storing or maintaining ownership over the digital cards. The owner of a Cryptokitty actually owns the kitty. There is no company to go bankrupt, meaning that the kitties will be around as long as the Ethereum blockchain is around. Lessons from Cryptokitties The fact that the game congested the Ethereum network by using 15% of its computing power isn’t a bad thing. Yes, it might look like a problem at first glance, since the Ethereum blockchain clearly isn’t ready for mainstream adoption. If a small game can already cause these problems, what if Salt or Golem are being used on a large scale? Well, you couldn’t download a 4GB video game in 1995 either. The development of technology takes time and the speculative side of the crypto market completely ignores this fact. The congestion is a good thing because it signals that blockchain technology just isn’t as far along as people think it already is. Problems like this also put pressure on the Ethereum developers, who’ve been working day in and day out on the Ethereum Metropolis upgrade. Cryptokitties has shown us that the future isn’t here just yet. On the bright side, Cryptokitties actually is the first Ethereum application that’s being used on a large scale. The news of its rapid expansion has reached some larger media outlets; this time, the news isn’t about some disruptive, complex blockchain technology, but about digital cats. Finally, something which attracts non-techies to blockchain because they can understand it! Cryptokitties isn’t the killer app that blockchain needs for mass adoption just yet, but these digital kitties have surely set the wheels in motion by giving blockchain and cryptocurrencies a whole new twist. And maybe these Cryptokitties will actually be worth quite a lot in the far future, as they are the first blockchain collectible.

While new interest and FOMO brings more and more money into the cryptocurrency market, it has come at a cost. Source: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html Bitcoin fees are becoming out of control. Transaction wait times are increasing. And with CryptoKitties taking off, even Ethereum has started to experience some transaction backlog. In a previous article, I discussed a 2nd layer scaling solution called Lightning Network. If you haven’t learned about the scaling problem or Lightning Network, I suggest you read that first and then come back here. As amazing as the Lightning Network is, it’s important to realize that it’s more than just a single protocol; it’s an entirely new concept for how to think of payments. In this article, we take a closer look at Bolt, one of the first in the next generation of advanced micropayment channel technologies. The Power of Bidirectional Payment Channels Lightning Network and Bolt both enable fast and cheap transactions by using bidirectional payment channels. A payment channel is simply a connection between two parties that can be used for unlimited trustless transactions, with only the first and last of those transactions being posted on the blockchain. Bidirectional channels are those in which money can be sent from either party in the channel to the other, rather than just one way. This concept becomes even more powerful in the context of multi-party payment channels. For example, suppose that Alice has a payment channel open with Bob and that Bob additionally has a payment channel open with Carol. With multi-party payment channels, Alice doesn’t need to open a channel with Carol to send her some money. Instead, she can send the amount to Bob, who then immediately sends the same amount to Carol. The result, in theory, is a universal peer-to-peer payment network of nodes in which anybody connected to the network can seamlessly route money to anybody else, in a cheap, instantaneous and scalable manner. Of course, since we are still in the world of cryptocurrencies, all of this is done trustlessly. Problems with the Lightning Network As cool as it may sound in theory, it is not yet clear whether Lightning Network will prove to be quite as ideal in practice. The chief concern is that a real-world implementation of the Lightning Network may not be as fully decentralized. Instead, much like the modern internet, there might be only a few large hubs that serve as intermediaries for the vast majority of transactions. In this type of hub-and-spoke model, an intermediary would have to know all the information about transactions that they are involved in. When Alice sends money to Carol through Bob, Bob knows both the amount that was sent as well as the identities (wallet addresses) of all parties. What happens if Bob has the power to control not only who gets to connect to the Lightning Network, but also who gets to make a payment and when? What happens if Bob is forced to turn over these records to the FBI? (Or worse, the IRS?). What you end up with is a network that is now prone to censorship and privacy invasion. Of course, this isn’t the end of the world. Lightning Network will still be incredibly useful and, from a security standpoint, it is still leaps and bounds ahead of the current financial system. But, as it turns out, we can do much, much better. What is Bolt? Bolt is a new model that uses the latest in cryptography to accomplish the same goals as the Lightning Network, but in a way that is completely anonymous. Channel intermediaries don’t know the sender, recipient or amount of a transaction and yet, they can still verify beyond any doubt that the micropayment transaction is 100% valid. In other words, you, as an end-user, would be totally anonymous with respect to all of the other individuals connecting to the same intermediary. In a perfectly decentralized payment, this is perhaps not as important. But the larger and more centralized the intermediary hubs are, the more useful and important your privacy becomes. How Does Bolt Work? Much of the security comes from the same game-theoretic incentives that the Lightning Network uses. However, Bolt makes use of two additional advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure privacy: Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Enables a party to mathematically prove statements about encrypted data without revealing anything about the underlying information. Blind Signatures: Enables a party to cryptographically sign encrypted data without needing to see the underlying data. Imagine that instead of sending transparently signed transactions through the network that anybody can read, a Bolt user would instead send zero-knowledge proofs about their identity and current balance without revealing either piece of information. In return, the intermediaries can sign (and therefore approve) these payments using blind signatures without being able to read the transaction. As long as the intermediary has verified the cryptography correctly, it can be sure that the user will only ever close out the channel with the correct balance. The precise details of the scheme are somewhat more complicated. Luckily, the original white paper, designed the same Johns Hopkins researchers behind the Zcash protocol, has been rigorously peer-reviewed. Bolt in the Real World The technology outlined in the Bolt paper could be implemented by any cryptocurrency that satisfies a few basic requirements. Bitcoin would only be able to support Bolt in its full capacity with some small changes. However, we all know how difficult it is to achieve consensus with Bitcoin’s governance model and passionate community, so this is probably still a long way off for the crypto giant. The same is true for the big privacy-focused cryptocurrencies – Monero, Zcash, and Dash. Using anonymous payment channels would be particularly nice for these cryptos because the opening and closing transactions that go on the blockchain could also be anonymous. In other words, the money would be untraceable even before it enters into the micropayment channel. Given the interest in privacy in these communities, we would expect that they would be more eager to reach consensus on any necessary changes. And then there’s Ethereum. Due to its vastly superior flexibility, implementing Bolt wouldn’t require any protocol changes whatsoever. Adding this to the scaling arsenal, along with the new privacy-centric features offered by the latest hard fork, Ethereum looks like a strong bet to scale more effectively and securely than any of its peers. Last Thoughts Throughout the toxic political and tribal conflicts that have plagued the cryptocurrency scaling debate, it is easy to forget that this so-called crypto-revolution begins and ends with technological innovation. Bolt is one big step closer to realizing the original dream of a trustless, scalable, and censorship-resistant global currency. In an industry still young enough for silver bullets, Bolt might just be the next big solution. Get all the technical details on Bolt in their whitepaper.

Blockchain company Provenance answers the call through their mission to help businesses provide irrefutable proof of a transparent supply chain. Technology’s Role in Safeguarding the Ecology In a world increasingly plagued by the ills of environmental irresponsibilities, technology is often seen as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, increased production means increased pollution. On the other, technological advancements result in environmentally-friendly production. Environmentally conscious businesses are on the rise, but so is greenwashing. Greenwashing refers to marketing yourself as a sustainable business for the sake of capturing the market when, in fact, your practices leave much to be desired. Thanks to blockchain startups like Provenance, technology is at a point where it can aid conscious consumers in their quest to support only ethical companies who walk the talk… and are able to prove it. Dis/trust the Supply Chain Eco-conscious shoppers have a hard time. There’s staying away from palm oil, taking a stand against products produced in sweatshops, and ensuring that the ecological footprint from production to market is sustainable. None of this is easy, not only because it is so much more involved than the typical “Susan went to the market and bought a loaf of bread” process flow that most shoppers are accustomed to. Unfortunately, as much as a company may state environmental goals in its mission statement or list such accolades in its marketing copy, there’s, in fact, no way of knowing. Counterfeits are also a huge market problem resulting in nearly half a trillion dollars worth of losses each year, and manufacturing of these goods are very often the result of sweatshop labor under inhumane working conditions. In the modern age, we all suffer from a lack of inherent trust in the systems that have been built to sustain and improve our lives. Questioning everyone and everything has become a daily modus operandi that is neither feasible nor conducive to peaceful living. We live in a world where trusting governments and corporations have become the exception rather than the norm. Provenance’s mission is to use the trustlessness of the blockchain to introduce the principle of trust into our spending habits. The company is built on the adage: We enable great businesses to build trust in their goods and supply chain. Provenance-powered data helps shoppers choose your product. How It Works Provenance provides transparency between manufacturers, sellers, and buyers. The model is built on providing insights into a business’ supply chain based on the following key principles: Transparency Verification Tracking and tracing The Provenance platform allows buyers to gain a transparent insight into the people, places, and processes that have contributed to the creation of a particular product. Data verification allows for proven business and supply chain claims. This gives consumers peace of mind that the company they’re buying from walks the talk. Batches or even individual items are given digital passports, enabling buyers to follow a digitally-verified journey from start to finish. Through this newfound data-driven communication method, customers can rest easy that their shopping habits align with the ethics of their consumption. Provenance provides sellers with tools to aid relationship-building and drive shopper engagement. Provenance data can be embedded into any online environment, and smart labels provide physical, hands-on interaction with the supply chain process available on the product packaging itself Source: https://www.provenance.org/ Shoppers will be able to scan a QR code and have access to a digital walk-through of the supply chain from manufacture to sale, verifying that the claims the product is making are true. Business Benefits Building trust and loyalty is business gold. Many companies, though, feel that their stronghold can just as easily be built on a foundation of sand. It just takes one major news story, even if seriously misconstrued, to damage a company’s reputation. On the other hand, industry exposes can damage even the most ethical business if there’s no method and/or funds to prove that their own practices are above board. Integrating a blockchain solution, Provenance is able to inject trust, provide authenticity, and foster loyalty. It achieves this by encouraging a collaborative atmosphere between the consumption triage of manufacturer, seller and buyer, by securing data storage, and through providing valuable integration between online and offline touchpoints. Source: https://www.provenance.org/ The Shopping Experience of the Future A survey run by Ingredient Communications shows that up to 73 percent of the 1,300 respondents surveyed across Europe, the US, and Asia, would pay higher prices in exchange for knowledge of an ingredient’s quality and consistency. Of these, 44 percent would pay up to 75 percent more for this knowledge. Brands all know how important storytelling is to their bottom line. Historically, a good story came as a result of a great copywriter with a solid understanding of Psych 101. Blockchain technology, however, enables a shift of the substance a story is built on. Companies like Provenance enables shoppers to engage with brands in a way that is digitally verified and relies not on bold claims but hard facts. If this much-needed technology is anything to go by, the future for shoppers is looking good.

Read our beginner's introduction to blockchain technology, decentralized ledgers, and cryptocurrencies.","title":"What is Blockchain Technology? An Easy Guide For Beginners (2019)","content":" Blockchain Basics What is Blockchain Technology? A Beginner’s Guide February 18, 2018 By Chantelle Lafaille You may have heard the term “blockchain technology” before, in reference to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For the uninitiated, the term might seem abstract with little real meaning on the surface. However, blockchain technology is a critical element of cryptocurrencies — without it, digital currencies like Bitcoin would not exist. If you are new to cryptocurrencies, and new to blockchain technology, read this guide on the basics to get yourself started. If you are already a seasoned trader, maybe you’ll learn a thing or two you didn’t already know. A Brief History of Blockchain To start, let’s talk about the history of the blockchain. Before it was ever used in cryptocurrency, it had humble beginnings as a concept in computer science — particularly, in the domains of cryptography and data structures. The very primitive form of the blockchain was the hash tree, also known as a Merkle tree. This data structure was patented by Ralph Merkle in 1979, and functioned by verifying and handling data between computer systems. In a peer-to-peer network of computers, validating data was important to make sure nothing was altered or changed during transfer. It also helped to ensure that false data was not sent. In essence, it is used to maintain and prove the integrity of data being shared. In 1991, the Merkle tree was used to create a “secured chain of blocks” — a series of data records, each connected to the one before it. The newest record in this chain would contain the history of the entire chain. And thus, the blockchain was created. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamato conceptualized the distributed blockchain. It would contain a secure history of data exchanges, utilize a peer-to-peer network to time stamp and verify each exchange, and could be managed autonomously without a central authority. This became the backbone of Bitcoin. And thus, the blockchain we know today was born, as well as the world of cryptocurrencies. How Does Blockchain Work? So, then, how does the blockchain work? Let’s recall a few key features before we get into the details: 1. Blockchain keeps a record of all data exchanges — this record is referred to as a “ledger” in the cryptocurrency world, and each data exchange is a “transaction“. Every verified transaction is added to the ledger as a “block” 2. It utilizes a distributed system to verify each transaction — a peer-to-peer network of nodes 3. Once signed and verified, the new transaction is added to the blockchain and can not be altered To begin, we need to explore the concept of “keys”. With a set of cryptographic keys, you get a unique identity. Your keys are the Private Key and Public Key, and together they are combined to give you a digital signature. Your public key is how others are able to identify you. Your private key gives you the power to digitally sign and authorize different actions on behalf of this digital identity when used with your public key. In the cryptocurrency world, this represents your wallet address (public key) and your private key is what let’s you authorize transfers, withdrawals, and other actions with your digital property like cryptocurrencies. As an aside, this is why it’s so important to keep your private key safe — anyone who has your private key can use it to access any of your digital assets associated with your public key and do what they want with it! Everytime a transaction occurs, that transaction is signed by whoever is authorizing it. That transaction might be something like “Alice is sending Bob 0.4 BTC”, will include Bob’s address (public key), and will be signed by a digital signature using both Alice’s public key and private key. This gets added to the ledger of that blockchain that Alice sent Bob 0.4 BTC, and will also include a timestamp and a unique ID number. When this transaction occurs, it’s broadcasted to a peer-to-peer network of nodes — basically other digital entities that acknowledge that this transaction has occurred and adds it to the ledger. Each transaction in that ledger will have the same data: a digital signature, a public key, a timestamp, and a unique ID. Each transaction will be connected, so if you move back one transaction in the ledger, you may see that Chuck sent Alice 0.8 BTC at some time. If you move back another transaction, you might see that Dan sent Chuck 0.2 BTC at some other time before that. The anonymity of cryptocurrencies come from the fact that your public key is just a randomized sequence of numbers and letters — so you are not literally signing with your own name or some sort of handle. A public key doesn’t tell you the real identity of the person behind it. You are also more or less free to generate as many key pairs as you want and have multiple cryptocurrency wallets. Be warned though, there could be other ways someone can figure out your identity — for example, through your spending habits. Why is Decentralization So Important? For enthusiasts of blockchain, you will hear a lot about the decentralized aspect of it. What makes this so appealing is that it makes the blockchain impervious to censorship, tampering, or corruption. Because it uses a peer-to-peer network, copies of the ledger are stored in many different locations, and unless you manage to track down every single one of them (Bitcoin is estimated to have over 35,000 nodes in its P2P network), you can’t destroy it. As well, because so many different, independent nodes are keeping track of the ledger, modifying it in an untrustworthy way won’t go very far because all the other nodes will disagree with that transaction and won’t add it to the ledger. This is a huge part of why so many people believe blockchain technology is the future of currency, and why it is being adopted in industries other than cryptocurrency. There’s Always a Downside However, like any system created by humans, there are always downsides. Blockchain technology has a pretty steep learning curve. Especially for the typical individual without a technical background, all the jargon and computer science concepts involved may intimidate and scare away otherwise would-be users. However, the rising popularity of cryptocurrency is resulting in the blockchain moving into the mainstream, with a lot more resources available to make the topic more approachable. Transferring, trading, and buying cryptocurrencies usually involves a transaction fee, and is not usually instantaneous. The former can be costly, the latter inconvenient. There is also a concept called the “51% attack” — if for some reason 51% of a peer-to-peer network validates an otherwise invalid transaction, it will still get approved and added to the ledger by nature of how the validation process works. Maybe right now it’s unlikely to happen, but it is a security flaw that might have potential for exploitation in the future. However, there are a lot of developers, users, and enthusiasts who truly believe blockchain technology is the future. Many want to see the technology succeed, so stay tuned for new developments!

Even though the two technologies have highly different developing parties and applications, researchers have been discussing and exploring their combination, and they have been found to go extremely well together. In the following article, I will discuss the basics of Artificial Intelligence, followed by the fields in which the two technologies exhibit highly promising convergent potentialities. A Brief Introduction to Artificial Intelligence The term “Artificial Intelligence”, henceforth shortened to “AI”, is much older than generally assumed. It was first coined by computer scientist professor John McCarthy in 1955. He originally defined AI as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” McCarthy was the same professor who initiated widely recognized research in the field of AI, thanks to early experiments with self-driving cars, decision-making models, and cloud computing. Essentially, AI are machines and computers capable of working and reacting to situations in the same, but preferably better, way than humans. What we’re trying to achieve with AI is to recreate intelligence. With AI programs, scientists are trying to make systems do the following: Learn from past experiences to perform better in new situations that they haven’t come across yet Draw conclusions from the available data to give meaning to a situation Analyze environment and situations, and be able to interpret them correctly Many scientists in the field of AI predict that the technology will soon outperform humans in many fields, starting with translating (predicted for 2024) all the way to surgery (predicted for 2053). Although experts disagree on the timeframe in which AI will start overtaking humans in these areas, they all agree on thing: it will happen. Source: artificial-solutions.com AI Applied A number of science fiction movies have already introduced us to the concept of AI through virtual assistants. These computer-based assistants perform the tasks we ask them to do such as research, scheduling, recommending entertainment, and answering our questions. Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant, is an AI program that is already doing just that for us, indicating that AI has already made its way into our day-to-day lives. From here on, we can expect AI applications to be further developed to make our lives easier, allowing us to outsource more and more complex routine tasks, such as problem solving, learning, and customizing other machines we use in our homes and workplaces. The AI Arms Race AI’s consumer applications are great innovations, ridding us of iterative daily tasks and saving users a lot of time. However, on a global level, AI is regarded as one of, if not the key asset for nations wanting to become the world’s dominant country. This is because experts believe that once AI is developed enough, it can lead to major strategic advantages due to AI’s superior intelligence to humans. This has been dubbed the global AI arms race and, like the nuclear arms race, it’s been escalating quite rapidly, with billions of dollars being invested in the research and development of AI programs. This has been happening because world leaders and AI experts believe that the first nation to create a superior AI will have a permanent advantage over its competitors. Theoretically, this advanced AI will be able to develop other AIs, resulting in exponential growth that no sizeable team of experts will be able to compete with. It doesn’t matter if a nation creates this AI 2 years or 2 months ahead of its competition. As Russian leader Putin put it, “Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” Do we really want this extremely powerful technology to fall in the hands of one central party? Whether this omnipotent and self-replicating AI is controlled by a company such as Google, Amazon, or IBM, or by a central government, the thought of one entity wielding such power is frightening. Here’s where blockchain comes into play, creating the option to globalize and decentralize AI entirely. And based on the above scenario, we really want AI ultimately to be decentralized. Decentralized Artificial Intelligence and Its Benefits Decentralized Intelligence Due to its decentralized nature, blockchain can potentially neutralize the risk of one party’s monopoly of AI and their ability to control one of the most powerful and dangerous technologies known to man. If we were to decentralize AI, AI algorithms could become Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). DAOs are organizations that are able to operate autonomously and in a decentralized way through smart contracts, without having a central party pulling the strings and making decisions. The users of DAOs, who constitute its network, will decide how a DAO functions and operates. Participants of a blockchain network are directly connected to each other, without going through a third party. Imagine Airbnb as a DAO. Contact between house owners and travellers would be based on smart contracts through which they can transact directly with each other. This same model would apply for AI programs running as DAOs. Its learning algorithms would be informed by its smart contract design and the DAO will have to buy its data input from the market. A project that is already working on such a DAO is called SingularityNET, a highly ambitious project definitely worth checking out. Such an AI DAO would operate as constituted by its smart contracts. It will only be able to perform the actions that are specified in these smart contracts. Designing these smart contracts are extremely complex and the success of an AI DAO will be completely dependent on this architectural design. When conducted optimally, an AI DAO would be able to take over development at some point because it is designed to learn through data to optimize itself much more effectively than could be done through human design. An important note to this is that these smart contracts must be designed with the utmost precaution and precision to ensure the network stays in control and not the AI. As is the case with blockchain applications, there is no one plug to pull, but an entire network keeping the chains running. We really don’t want an unstoppable, Skynet-esque AI blockchain running autonomously, programming itself with us being unable to shut it down. Data Protection The progress of AI is completely dependent on the input of data – our data. Through data, AI receives information about the world and things happening on it. Basically, data feeds AI, and through it AI will be able continuously improve itself. On the other side, blockchain is essentially a technology that allows for the encrypted storage of data on a distributed ledger. It allows for the creation of fully secured databases which can be looked into by parties who have been approved to do so. When combining blockchains with AI, we have a backup system for the sensitive and highly valuable personal data of individuals. For example, Spotify uses the data we give it to recommend music based on our preferences. This recommendation runs on AI, and it is a great feature for Spotify users, most of whom don’t have a problem sharing their usage data. However, when it comes to medical or financial data, although receiving recommendations would be extremely valuable, this data is too sensitive to hand over to a single company and its algorithms. Storing this data on a blockchain, which can be accessed by an AI, but only with permission and once it has gone through the proper procedures, could give us the enormous advantages of personalized recommendations while safely storing our sensitive data. Data Monetization Another disruptive innovation that could be possible by combining the two technologies is the monetization of data. Monetizing collected data is a huge revenue source for large companies, such as Facebook and Google. Platform users create personal data by using their online services. This data is then collected, grouped, stored, and eventually sold to other companies. This makes data incredibly valuable – more valuable than we as users realize, and we are giving it away for free. Data is the new oil, and it could become our most valuable asset in the near future. Blockchain makes it possible for us to monetize the data we create through data marketplaces. By using blockchain technology, we can actually own our data and decide what to do with it. Instead of third parties selling our data to companies, often using unethical and insecure means, companies will have to buy it directly from us. This wasn’t possible before because of the stringent process of going through third parties and dealing with expensive fiat currency transactions. Blockchain technology enables microtransactions, which is exactly what we need for the trade of data. The same goes for AI programs that need our data. In order for AI algorithms to learn and develop, AI networks will be required to buy data directly from its creators (i.e. us) through data marketplaces. This will make the entire process a far more fair process than it currently is, without tech giants exploiting its users. Such a data marketplace will also open up AI for smaller companies. Developing and feeding AI is incredibly costly for companies that do not generate their own data. Through decentralized data marketplaces, they will be able to access otherwise too expensive and privately kept data. Trusting AI Decision Making As AI algorithms become smarter through learning, it will become increasingly difficult for data scientists to understand how these programs came to specific conclusions and decisions. This is because AI algorithms will be able to process incredibly large amounts of data and variables. However, we must continue to audit conclusions made by AI because we want to make sure they’re still reflecting reality. Through the use of blockchain technology, there are immutable records of all the data, variables, and processes used by AIs for their decision-making processes. This makes it far easier to audit the entire process. With the appropriate blockchain programming, all steps from data entry to conclusions can be observed, and the observing party will be sure that this data has not been tampered with. It creates trust in the conclusions drawn by AI programs. This is a necessary step, as individuals and companies will not start using AI applications if they don’t understand how they function, and on what information they base their decisions. Concluding Remarks The combination of blockchain technology and Artificial Intelligence is still a largely undiscovered area. Even though the convergence of the two technologies has received its fair share of scholarly attention, projects devoted to this groundbreaking combination are still scarce. When people with access to the highest quality information concerning AI, like Elon Musk, are saying that AI could be the biggest existential threat in existence, giving this power to one single entity isn’t the best idea. Decentralizing AI and letting it be designed and controlled by a large network through open-source programming is probably the safest approach to create superintelligence. Putting the two technologies together has the potential to use data in ways never before thought possible. Data is the key ingredient for the development and enhancement of AI algorithms, and blockchain secures this data, allows us to audit all intermediary steps AI takes to draw conclusions from the data, and allows individuals to monetize their produced data. AI can be incredibly revolutionary, but it must be designed with utmost precautions – blockchain can greatly assist in this. How the interplay between the two technologies will progress is anyone’s guess. However, its potential for true disruption is clearly there, and rapidly developing.

March 11, 2018 By Jorn van Zwanenburg NEO’s price has experienced quite some volatility over the past few weeks. There was a strong bullish sentiment for NEO in the beginning of the year, with a peak price of $191.26, after which it held strong against the market crash. But it started to crumble after the Ontology airdrop and some widespread FUD. NEO’s smart economy is taking a solid shape, with a lot of new applications being built on top of its blockchain. Nonetheless, the project has received some negative press as of late. In this article, we present an update on some of NEO’s developments, criticisms, and future prospects. NEO Smart Economy The NEO team defines their idea of the NEO smart economy on their website: Digital Assets + Digital Identity + Smart Contract = Smart Economy This means that NEO intends to become an economy through which companies can directly transact with each other without having to go through intermediaries. Over the last couple of months, we’ve been seeing their smart economy growing with an increased number of applications. Most of these applications seem to have been strategically designed to boost the value and functionality of the overall NEO ecosystem. For example, TheKey provides identification services, Trinity enhances NEO’s scalability, and Red Pulse creates a marketplace for market intelligence. There’s one ICO that has received a lot of attention lately: the Neonexchange (NEX). NEX will be a decentralized exchange based on the NEO blockchain. On this exchange, NEP-5 tokens and other to-be-announced cryptocurrencies can be traded in a secure, high-speed, and advanced way. NEX has a rather unique ICO, in which a lottery will determine who among ICO subscribers will be allowed to invest. Additionally, the block snapshot for the Ontology airdrop occurred on March 1, 2018. This token distribution for NEO holders took place for the purpose of connecting the NEO and soon-to-be Ontology platforms. 10% of all total ONT tokens has also been distributed to the NEO council as a signal of their cooperation. The NEO ecosystem has also been expanding by adopting applications that were meant to be deployed on other blockchains. This is quite unique in the blockchain space, and has been in the headlines recently. The blockchain projects that switched over announced that they saw faster and easier development on the NEO blockchain due to its superior technology to other blockchains. Here’s a list of the projects that switched to NEO: Guardium WoWoo Narrative PikcioChain Centralized council NEO’s Reasons for Centralization Decisions on which applications and ICOs will be allowed on the NEO blockchain are made by the NEO council. One of the main points of criticism against NEO has been its centralization. When a blockchain is centralized, it means that the decision-making isn’t done by the users and the network, but by a central party. In NEO’s case, this central party is the NEO Council, which collectively owns 50% of NEO tokens. This governing body consists of the founders of the NEO project, and they decide how the large amount of NEO tokens in their possession will be distributed to further the development of NEO. An example of a possible use for these funds is to incentivize developers to enhance the project, like the City of Zion community. This is a group of developers, designers, and translators that cooperate on an open-source base to support NEO and its ecosystem. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, NEO co-founder Da Hongfei stated: The NEO council conserved 50% of the total supply of NEO tokens. And we are using these tokens to foster the ecosystem. We are paying developers, we are organizing events. We use these tokens to do good things for the project. Moreover, NEO’s consensus mechanism operates faster when the system is centralized. It uses a consensus mechanism called the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance, in which nodes that can verify blocks are designated by the network, in this case the NEO council. Da Hongfei already announced that the number of nodes will expand over time, making the network more decentralized. Da Hongfei sees advantages in such governing bodies over complete decentralization. He says: Censorship resistance is not our goal. Thus, a more centralized approach to the typical blockchain and cryptocurrency, which doesn’t fare well with some groups within the crypto community. There are already plans to further decentralize the NEO network. As Da Hongfei said in the interview: We are in a process of decentralization. NEO council is like a parent to look after the project for the next few years, but eventually it (NEO) will be fully decentralized. Recent Criticisms About NEO Besides the issues some blockchain community members have with the centralization of NEO, there has been more fear, doubt, and uncertainty about the performance and capabilities of NEO’s technology. The author of the blog storeofvalue.com has written highly critical articles on NEO (however, it must be noted that the author has been called out for making false claims by the NEO team). In these articles, the author presents well-researched (potential) issues with the scalability of NEO’s blockchain. Previous ICOs on NEO’s blockchain severely slowed down NEO’s block time, something which shouldn’t be possible as the NEO blockchain can supposedly handle 1,000 transactions per second. Moreover, recently the blockchain was brought to a halt for two hours without an increase in the number of transactions. One of the limited number of NEO nodes didn’t respond, causing the blockchain to stop. This led to more negativity and one rant went viral on Twitter (the author later apologized and corrected several incorrect assumptions mentioned in the rant). It’s important to note that the NEO team has responded to these issues, with Da Hongfei officially clarifying the recent bugs in their blockchain. NEO’s lead developer, Erik Zhang, tweeted that they are aware of the problem with their nodes and almost have a solution in place. Approved By China? In the previously mentioned interview, Da Hongfei said that regulation is no problem for NEO. He even thinks it’s time for governments to step in and start regulating the crypto industry due to the large number of malpractices in the space. China has been coming down hard on cryptocurrencies in general, but the China-based blockchain project NEO has thus far been allowed to continue its ICO activities. The pro-regulation approach of NEO seems to be working with the Chinese authorities, who have shown no signs of stopping any of NEO’s announced ICOs. We saw NEO getting dragged down hard during the periods of China FUD. This seems to have stopped, most likely because China has done almost everything in its power to block cryptocurrencies, to no avail. With time, it has become clear that China will not be able to entirely block cryptocurrencies in the long run. It’s likely they just want to fully control the situation; China has a reputation for investing heavily in technology, and it’s no different when it comes to blockchain. The Chinese government already has a national-level partnership with the blockchain platform VeChain, and it has more than once officially proclaimed the potential advantages and disruptions of blockchain technology. In addition to this, The People’s Daily, a Chinese government-backed newspaper, just recently endorsed blockchain technology, providing a direct insight on the stance of the Chinese authorities. This is again confirmed by another recent proposition by one of China’s top advisory boards, in which they floated the idea of a national crypto-trading platform. Evidently, China does not want to miss out on the biggest financial revolution in recent history – they just want to figure out how to control it first. Concluding Remarks These signs of the Chinese government potentially allowing cryptocurrencies after all and their approval of blockchain technology can be highly beneficial for NEO, especially given NEO’s pro-regulation stance. With their competitors having either left the country or the industry, NEO is one of the few remaining blockchain candidates vying to capture the second-largest economy in the world. It has been facing some critique after its last run, but the team has been responding to this, announcing improvements and debunking some wild accusations. We musn’t forget that the industry is still under development, and there are few, if any, projects that aren’t facing technological obstacles. Even though there are groups who oppose the idea of centralizing a blockchain, the NEO Council’s strategy behind their centralization makes sense. It has the clear purpose of increasing NEO’s blockchain and smart economy. With its rapidly growing ecosystem, transparent communication, and potential approval by the Chinese authorities, NEO is still right on track.

If you know what you’re doing, you can make a LOT of money when prices fall in a very short period of time. Want to know how to make these numbers as well? Get yourself a coffee, because it’ll be your life changing read on making money when the bitcoin price falls. Thousands of people stumbled into cryptocurrencies before it’s parabolic rise at the end of 2017, and some even sold near the all-time highs. Furthermore, a very small number of investors had the wherewithal and experience to short (bet against) the market. While a majority saw their bags plummet, a handful of pros made some serious gains on both the bull run of 2017 and the 2018 bear market. Looking at the gains of top traders on the platform we will cover in this guide – it is mind-boggling, to say the least: For those who are unaware, the profits in the image above are listed in XBT, which is equivalent to BTC… That means Heavy-Autumn-Wolf is sitting at $22,411,268.65 in Profit at the time of writing. While these results clearly aren’t the norm, the fact remains that you have access to the same set of tools, and could continue building your portfolio if those tools are used correctly. Simple exchanges like Coinbase offer a simplified user interface and an easy-to-execute process. ‘Intermediate’ exchanges, like Binance, offer more cryptocurrencies. Advanced exchanges like BitMEX typically attract more professional traders due to the array of advanced features they offer, like short positions and leverage. This article will show you how to bet against the Bitcoin with BitMEX, but before we dive in, it’s important to understand 2 things. Firstly, since we’re dealing with advanced financial investment features, it’s very important to understand the risks involved with advanced exchanges. If you’re unsure about something, take a step back and ‘go to school’ until you’re confident you understand what you’re doing. Secondly, BitMEX isn’t available in the United States, so you might want to consider using a VPN. Where Whales Make Money – Let’s Sign Up for BitMEX BitMEX makes it extremely easy to sign up for their exchange. Using any link to Bitmex in this article will save you 10% on trading fees for 6 months 🙂 That’s a lot and we will tell you why in a second. To make the process as simple as possible, sign up for BitMEX now, before reading the rest of this article, so you can follow along. First, go the BitMEX registration page, where you’ll be prompted with the following form: Enter an email address, create a secure password (short sentences with numbers and special characters work great) select your country of residence, then enter your first and last name. Accept the Terms of Service, then click the Register button. You should receive a confirmation with further instructions, which looks like this: You’ll be directed to a verification screen, which will direct you to your email inbox. Log into your email inbox and wait for your confirmation email, which looks like this: Click the blue Verify My Email button and you’ll be redirected to a confirmation page, which will then redirect you to the main BitMEX trading page. How To Make Your First Profitable Trade on BitMEX Now that you have your account, it’s time to learn what you can do with it. Trading strategies are typically honed over many years of trial and error, and it’s common to see new and intermediate traders practice with paper trading before introducing emotion with live trading. With that in mind, if the price of Bitcoin falls, here’s what you need to do to make your first profits. 1. Funding Your Account First, you’ll need to deposit Bitcoin into your account. Go to the account tab (1), click deposit in the menu on the left-hand side (2), and your exchange wallet address will be generated (3). BitMEX currently only accepts Bitcoin deposits. For more on this, check out our Beginner’s Guide: How To Buy Bitcoin. Now that you have your BitMEX wallet address, you’ll need to send BTC. If your BTC funds are coming from a smartphone, from the Coinbase app for example, you can send the funds using their QR code scanning feature. Alternatively, you can simply copy and paste your BitMEX wallet address to send funds from your smartphone or computer. Before sending your BTC, check to make sure the address is correct. Failure to do so could result in the loss of your funds, so make sure to check the first and last 4 characters at least, to verify you’ve entered the wallet address correctly. Pro Tip: If you’re depositing a significant amount to your BitMEX wallet, or any new wallet, send 1% of your funds separately first. This ‘warms up’ the wallet by putting it on the blockchain, and heavily reduces the odds of sending your funds to the wrong address. Your BitMEX account will be credited after 1 confirmation on the Bitcoin network, and when the funds are available in your account, you should see a notification at the top of your screen, like this: Now you’re ready to make your first trade! 2. How to Create a Short Position on BitMEX In this step, we will teach you exactly step by step how to create a short position on bitmex or in other words, how to bet on bitcoin price fall. For those who are new to the idea of shorting the market, check out the definition given by Investopedia: A short, or short position, is selling first and then buying later. The trader’s expectation is that the price will drop; the price they sell at is higher than the price they buy it at later. The difference between the sale price and the buy price produces a profit or loss. Before you jump right into entering the trade, there’s a very useful tool available that allows you to calculate relevant information with ease. This makes it simple to confirm you’re making a good trading decision, and even easier to actually enter the trade. After everything checks out on the calculator tool, you enter and confirm your trade. Of course, this is optional but also recommended. 3. Profit/Loss Calculator After your funds have shown up in your account, click the Trade tab (1), then find the Place Order section on the left-hand side of your screen. Click the Calculator icon (2), and a pop-up calculator will appear. Toggle the switch button so it selects Short (3). Next, direct your attention to the four input fields below (4). Each input field represents: Quantity — The amount of Bitcoin contracts you’ll be purchasing in USD. The diagram above shows a Quantity of 150 contracts, and the amount of XBT (which equals BTC 1:1) will cost is displayed to the right, in the row labeled Margin. The cost for this example is 0.0084 XBT. Entry Price — The Bitcoin price you’ll enter the market at. While you can decide where you want to enter the market, we’ll be entering the market at its current price. At the time of writing, the price was $3,570, as seen on the chart to the right of the calculator (5). Exit Price — The price you’ll exit the market at. The example Exit Price is $3,310, which is a 7.85% drop from $3,570. You can see the percent difference was automatically calculated in the Profit/Loss % row. Leverage — Multiples the effectiveness of your Bitcoin contracts. The example leverage is set to 5x. This means the most you stand to lose is 0.0084 BTC, but you stand to gain a disproportionate amount. This is most clearly displayed in the Profit/Loss % and Return on Entry (ROE%) rows, bringing the Profit % from 7.85% to 39.27%. BitMEX allows up to 100x leverage for Bitcoin, so adding leverage to your short on BitMEX allows you to make up to 100x more than the actual profit percentage. Of course, it comes with added risk. The higher your leverage, the less margin for error between your entry price and your liquidation price. Liquidation Price Calculator Your liquidation price is a set value that the price of Bitcoin cannot cross. Once the liquidation value is breached, your funds are gone. Now that you’ve determined your entry, exit, and leverage, it’s time to calculate your estimated liquidation price. Start by clicking the Liquidation Price tab on your calculator tool (1). Next, click the toggle button to select Short in the Side row, and leave Isolated selected in the Margin row (2). For those interested in the difference between Cross Margin and Isolated Margin, check out the beginning of this article. Now enter the same information from the Profit/Loss tab into the text fields (3), and check the price Liquidation Price (4). In this example, your funds will be liquidated when the price of Bitcoin hits $4,414. As previously mentioned, if you increase your Leverage, your Liquidation Price will be closer to your Entry Price, leaving less room for error. Again, once the price of Bitcoin hits your liquidation price, you will lose your funds. For example, if we change the leverage to 100x, take a look at how close the liquidation price is to our entry price in the image below. That means a fluctuation of only $4 in Bitcoin’s price would cause your funds to be liquidated, opposed to a fluctuation of $844 at a leverage of 5x. To start, stick with a leverage of 1x or 2x while you get used to shorting the market. Over time work your way up to 3x, 5x, 10x, and 25x. It’s not recommended to go beyond 25x. 4. Your First Real Trade Now that you’ve carefully calculated each segment of your trade, it’s time to purchase the contracts. 1. Go to the left-hand side of your screen, and under the Place Order tab, click the Market tab (1). This allows us to enter the market at the current price. 2. Next, enter the amount of contracts you wish to purchase (2). We’ll use the same number as we did in the calculator section above: 150. The total cost in XBT will be displayed under the red Sell Market button. In this case, the Cost after fees is 0.0084 XBT. The funds you deposited earlier will also be displayed in the Available Balance row (3), right beneath your Order Value, which is determined by the Quantity of contracts entered (2). Next, select the leverage you’d like to trade with (4). It’s worth noting that the leverage you choose will change the Cost of the contract. Try changing just the leverage to see its effect on the Cost, and notice how the Order Value remains the same. The price at which contracts are being exchanged (5) is different than the BitMEX Index price of Bitcoin (6).The contract price is displayed with large digits, and will flash red or green in color depending on whether the live trade was a sell or buy, respectively.Note: Liquidation prices are executed based on the BitMEX Index price (6).At this point, your trade information has been calculated and entered into your browser, and now it’s time to officially go short on Bitcoin. After clicking the button, a confirmation box will pop up, which allows you to confirm the information entered was correct. You can also change the leverage at this stage for whatever reason: After verifying everything is accurate, click the light blue Sell button at the bottom right-hand of the pop-up. You should see a submission confirmation pop up at the bottom right-hand corner of your screen that looks like this: You’ll also see green boxes pop up once the order has been filled. It’s worth noting your entry will sometimes partially fill, which will cause multiple green Order Filled boxes to pop up until the entire order is filled: Congrats! You’ve just shorted Bitcoin. Now that you know how to make a short position, let’s learn how to close it. How to Close a Short Position on BitMEX Since entering your short position required you to contractually sell the market, to exit your position, you’ll need to buy the market. You’ll want to exit the market for 1 of 2 reasons: either you’ve made enough profit, or lost too much and want to avoid liquidation. You can easily keep track of how well your trades are doing near the bottom of your dashboard (1) or on the left-hand side of your screen (2). Once you decide it’s time to exit, there are 2 different ways to do so, and BitMEX makes both of them very easy to complete. First, let’s look at where on your screen it will happen. Take a look at the red box below, highlighting the bottom right-hand corner of your screen. Both methods of closing your order are located in this box. You can either close at the current market price or enter a specific price you’d like to close it at. Take a closer look below. Market Close By clicking the red Market button, you’ll exit the market at the current market price. This is called a Market Close. If you choose to click the market button, you’ll see a confirmation box like this: Click the light blue Market Close Position Button to exit the market. Next, you’ll see an Order Submission box pop up on the bottom right-hand corner of your screen, with green Order Filled boxes popping up as your contracts are bought: Limit Close Alternatively, by entering a number in the text field to the left of the gray Close button, you’ll choose the price you want to exit the market at. This is known as a Limit Close. For this example, we’ll use our previous calculations as an exit price, which was $3,310. Enter your desired exit price in the text input field and click the gray Close button. You’ll then be prompted with a confirmation box: Click the light blue Limit Close Position button to set the price you’ll exit the market. After you set your Limit Close Position, you’ll see a confirmation pop up in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen (1). It’s worth noting you can easily cancel your Limit Close by clicking the little red ‘x’ button in the Close Position section of your dashboard (2). Keeping Track of Your Positions From position entry to exit, your trading information is conveniently stored directly on the dashboard. For example, you can keep track of all your orders with the Order History tab. Click through 6 tabs in the same box you used to close your order to get comfortable with all the information provided. Simple as that! Now you’re familiar with how to make and close a short position on BitMEX. If you want to bet on the Bitcoin price rise, you can easily open your long position by going through the same process but the difference is that you have to press the green button as marked below in yellow. In the next chapter you’ll learn more advanced trading techniques on Bitmex. For now, we recommend you to take these steps below to secure your Bitmex account. 2-Factor Authentication Setup Quick Note: If you’re familiar with 2FA and already have the Google Authenticator App, go to the Account tab, click My Account on the left-hand menu, then find the Security section to complete the 2FA process. Once you’re finished, skip ahead to the next section to make your first trade. If this is your first time setting up 2FA, you’ll need to download the Google Authenticator app for your smartphone or tablet device. Start by searching for “Google Authenticator” in the App Store for iPhone users, or Play Store for Android users (1a). Download and install the app to your phone (2a), open it up, and begin. Your smartphone/tablet screen sequence. Click the Begin Setup button, then select Scan Barcode in the pop up menu (3a). You’ll need to allow the app to access your camera, then you’ll see your camera open up, with a box inside the screen. Now you’ll need to jump to your BitMEX screen to locate the QR code you’ll be scanning. To find the QR code associated with your BitMEX account, login, click the Account tab (1b), click My Account on the left side of your screen (2b), then locate the Security section of the page. Select Google Authenticator from the dropdown menu (3b). Your computer screen. Pick up your phone/tablet and align the box on your phone/tablet’s screen with the QR code on your computer screen (4b). After your phone/tablet reads the code, it will display a 6-digit code (4a) and a timer that changes the code every 30 seconds (5a). Check to make sure the timer isn’t about to expire, then enter the 6-digit code into your BitMEX account (5b). Hover your mouse over the additional 2FA features (6b) to learn more about how you can maximize the security of your account. The default settings are satisfactory in most cases. Important: Be careful, it’s possible to lose your 2FA account information when switching to a new phone, and it can be difficult to recover. Now that your phone is connected to your account, you’ll need to use the Authenticator app to verify logins and withdrawals. Congrats! You’ve successfully signed up for BitMEX, created and closed a short position, and secured your account with 2FA.

In this example, your funds will be liquidated when the price of Bitcoin hits $4,414.\nAs previously mentioned, if you increase your Leverage, your Liquidation Price will be closer to your Entry Price, leaving less room for error. Again, once the price of Bitcoin hits your liquidation price, you will lose your funds.\nFor example, if we change the leverage to 100x, take a look at how close the liquidation price is to our entry price in the image below.\nThat means a fluctuation of only $4 in Bitcoin’s price would cause your funds to be liquidated, opposed to a fluctuation of $844 at a leverage of 5x.\nTo start, stick with a leverage of 1x or 2x while you get used to shorting the market. Over time work your way up to 3x, 5x, 10x, and 25x. It’s not recommended to go beyond 25x.\nNow that you’ve carefully calculated each segment of your trade, it’s time to purchase the contracts.\n1. Go to the left-hand side of your screen, and under the Place Order tab, click the Market tab (1). This allows us to enter the market at the current price.\n2. Next, enter the amount of contracts you wish to purchase (2). We’ll use the same number as we did in the calculator section above: 150.\nAfter clicking the button, a confirmation box will pop up, which allows you to confirm the information entered was correct. You can also change the leverage at this stage for whatever reason:\nAfter verifying everything is accurate, click the light blue Sell button at the bottom right-hand of the pop-up.\nYou should see a submission confirmation pop up at the bottom right-hand corner of your screen that looks like this:\nYou’ll also see green boxes pop up once the order has been filled. It’s worth noting your entry will sometimes partially fill, which will cause multiple green Order Filled boxes to pop up until the entire order is filled:\nCongrats! You’ve just shorted Bitcoin.\nNow that you know how to make a short position, let’s learn how to close it.\nSince entering your short position required you to contractually sell the market, to exit your position, you’ll need to buy the market.\nYou’ll want to exit the market for 1 of 2 reasons: either you’ve made enough profit, or lost too much and want to avoid liquidation. You can easily keep track of how well your trades are doing near the bottom of your dashboard (1) or on the left-hand side of your screen (2).\nOnce you decide it’s time to exit, there are 2 different ways to do so, and BitMEX makes both of them very easy to complete.\nFirst, let’s look at where on your screen it will happen. Take a look at the red box below, highlighting the bottom right-hand corner of your screen.\nBoth methods of closing your order are located in this box. You can either close at the current market price or enter a specific price you’d like to close it at.\nTake a closer look below.\nBy clicking the red Market button, you’ll exit the market at the current market price. This is called a Market Close. If you choose to click the market button, you’ll see a confirmation box like this:\nClick the light blue Market Close Position Button to exit the market.\nNext, you’ll see an Order Submission box pop up on the bottom right-hand corner of your screen, with green Order Filled boxes popping up as your contracts are bought:\nAlternatively, by entering a number in the text field to the left of the gray Close button, you’ll choose the price you want to exit the market at. This is known as a Limit Close.\nFor this example, we’ll use our previous calculations as an exit price, which was $3,310.\nEnter your desired exit price in the text input field and click the gray Close button. You’ll then be prompted with a confirmation box:\nClick the light blue Limit Close Position button to set the price you’ll exit the market.\nAfter you set your Limit Close Position, you’ll see a confirmation pop up in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen (1).\nIt’s worth noting you can easily cancel your Limit Close by clicking the little red ‘x’ button in the Close Position section of your dashboard (2).\nFrom position entry to exit, your trading information is conveniently stored directly on the dashboard.\nFor example, you can keep track of all your orders with the Order History tab.\nClick through 6 tabs in the same box you used to close your order to get comfortable with all the information provided.\nSimple as that! Now you’re familiar with how to make and close a short position on BitMEX.\nIf you want to bet on the Bitcoin price rise, you can easily open your long position by going through the same process but the difference is that you have to press the green button as marked below in yellow.\nIn the next chapter you’ll learn more advanced trading techniques on Bitmex.\nFor now, we recommend you to take these steps below to secure your Bitmex account.\nQuick Note: If you’re familiar with 2FA and already have the Google Authenticator App, go to the Account tab, click My Account on the left-hand menu, then find the Security section to complete the 2FA process. Once you’re finished, skip ahead to the next section to make your first trade.\nIf this is your first time setting up 2FA, you’ll need to download the Google Authenticator app for your smartphone or tablet device.\nStart by searching for “Google Authenticator” in the App Store for iPhone users, or Play Store for Android users (1a).\nDownload and install the app to your phone (2a), open it up, and begin.\nYour smartphone/tablet screen sequence.\nClick the Begin Setup button, then select Scan Barcode in the pop up menu (3a). You’ll need to allow the app to access your camera, then you’ll see your camera open up, with a box inside the screen.\nNow you’ll need to jump to your BitMEX screen to locate the QR code you’ll be scanning.\nTo find the QR code associated with your BitMEX account, login, click the Account tab (1b), click My Account on the left side of your screen (2b), then locate the Security section of the page. Select Google Authenticator from the dropdown menu (3b).\nYour computer screen.\nPick up your phone/tablet and align the box on your phone/tablet’s screen with the QR code on your computer screen (4b).\nAfter your phone/tablet reads the code, it will display a 6-digit code (4a) and a timer that changes the code every 30 seconds (5a).\nCheck to make sure the timer isn’t about to expire, then enter the 6-digit code into your BitMEX account (5b).\nHover your mouse over the additional 2FA features (6b) to learn more about how you can maximize the security of your account. The default settings are satisfactory in most cases.\nImportant: Be careful, it’s possible to lose your 2FA account information when switching to a new phone, and it can be difficult to recover. Now that your phone is connected to your account, you’ll need to use the Authenticator app to verify logins and withdrawals.\nCongrats! You’ve successfully signed up for BitMEX, created and closed a short position, and secured your account with 2FA.\nInvest in Blockchain © 2017 - 2019.

We discuss how blockchain is more than just a shared database and share the huge impact blockchain can have.","title":"Why Blockchain is the Next Big Thing","content":" Blockchain Basics Why Blockchain is the Next Big Thing October 27, 2017 By Mike Hulleman It took decades, but the mainstream adoption of the internet happened faster than any other technology we’ve ever known. A majority of people in the world don’t know it yet, but the blockchain is next. Here’s why. One day, we’ll all sit around holographic campfires and talk about how archaic life was in the early days of the internet. Anyone born in the 1980s or earlier may recall grandma talking about the hardships of her youth — walking 10 miles to school, uphill both ways, paper thin clothes, in the snow. They shared bathwater during the Great Depression. Food wasn’t full of chemicals, yet vegetables were a luxury during cold months. Every summer road trip and Thanksgiving dinner, same stories. And she’d go on and on, and we loved her, so we’d sit intently and listen. Let’s fast forward to 20 years from today. Call it a hunch, but it will be our generation’s turn to reminisce about our youth. It’ll be the first round of stories: “We had to actually wait in a standing line, have awkward conversations — with our mouths! With the person standing beside us. We had waiting times. It took 2 weeks to get approved for a mortgage! Remember that, Earl?”. One day, that’ll be us. Because of blockchain technology and its razor sharp awesomeness. Still so far to go, Louis.Ok, I don’t know any Earls, but you get the idea. The internet is outdated. It took 20 years for it to be adopted by the planet, and now it’s so, over. Just like the name Earl. What’s Wrong with our Existing Systems (and the Internet)? The internet today is a tangled, inefficient mess. First, let’s take a high level look at where its faults lay, and then get into how blockchain is going to smooth over the ugly parts. It’s easier to paint a picture of how amazing blockchain will soon be by demonstrating where the internet currently needs work. I’m really oversimplifying for this one, blockchain isn’t an easy nut to crack. Here are a few ways our current internet-connected systems are inefficient. Human Involvement All computer systems, for the most part, have human bottlenecks. We have so many touchpoints for human intervention because the truth is, we don’t (and we can’t!) trust our existing systems in their current state. PayPal will freeze your account on a moment’s notice because you used a different browser. Bank loans aren’t approved instantly. All eCommerce requires confirmation from a third party business with their own icky systems that webmasters must integrate or else. Existing systems rely on triggers and people. On a given day, one “customer service” person needlessly wastes the time of 100 people. Systems aren’t autonomous enough; and when a human gets involved, queues form, and you wait. Frontline staff have department managers who have managers who have managers. Waiting for a tax refund is the worst. Even though we use computers today, it doesn’t always improve something; it just makes it more expensive. Databases All Over the Place Product catalog, database. Product inventory and location inside the warehouse, different databases. Bank account, database. Shipping costs by weight, shipping address, shipping method — database, database, database. All in centralised locations, in whatever country. It’s quaint by 2030 standards. So inefficient. And in order for these present-day databases to speak to one another, they need expensive database integrations (APIs) and bleeding edge internet connections. And those fail, so what do we do? We add humans to keep an eye on them. That’s efficient! No sarcasm at all. Ok, maybe just a little. Security Vulnerabilities This year alone showed just how poorly the internet and all its connected systems are performing. After all this time, you’d think that we got this. Instead, the internet runs like some sort of Keynesian nightmare; boom and bust cycles of internet meltdowns. Let’s look in our bag of 2017 internet hacks. That whole ransomware thing based on a really old vulnerability makes me wanna cry, WiFi bugs that are insane only because they still exist, and the fact that so many sites can still root your mobile phone in seconds is a real modern-life buzzkill. Isn’t that enough? Of course not. Businesses are still trying to save face through it all, and the year isn’t over yet. If a database at some ho-hum corporation is governed by internal security policies unseen in the light of day, we can’t trust it. Equifax, anyone? Am I loud and clear? Most of us don’t know it, but we wish for immutable databases and don’t see the answer right under our noses. It’s an itch we can’t scratch. Blockchain: More Than Just a Shared Database Now I’d like to build a case for blockchain technology solving our current technological woes. Check out our other articles about blockchain which also discuss the benefits and potential uses of blockchain technology. Shared Database Imagine if all related corporations worked their business processes into a shared database the way they use the same power grid. It would speed up the whole internet. No more junk massive cloud backups, hacker crap, and best of all –no more hiding malicious internal Enron-levels of evil. Everyone is on the same page, software makers and regulators, too. No More Human Involvement The blockchain, and in today’s case, that of Ethereum, has smart contract technology that will be able to initiate, calculate, and enforce contracts without human intervention. And we all don’t need to know exactly how it works, we just need it to. Do you actually know how a TV works? Do you need to? Personally, I had a light switch in my house for 14 years and I moved out never knowing what it did. But I still lived well. That line of thinking may be what blockchain will be to the average person. And that’s all fine. Always the leftmost light switchFinancial institutions, warehouse operations, and even governmental departments like the Department of Motor Vehicles can all benefit (and speed things up) by using smart contracts. The point is no more waiting times, no more queues, no more weeks or months to get a tax refund. For me, the best part is no more low-grade government employees that are rude to me. Information Security The blockchain is immutable. In other words, blockchain technology is the Drake of the database world; he keeps coming back. We don’t need to like him but even if you hate his songs, 34 other musicians will still buy the rights and put out the same lyrics — and you’ll like those! Take Hotline Bling for instance. Erykah did it betterMy point is that when you have more than one copy of the same database stored on hundreds of different machines and the majority can overrule an anomaly — you got something powerful. In Drake’s case, his song was terrible. The duplicates weren’t. And everyone benefited. In Conclusion In the first video above, Louis CK said we’re all a big bunch of whiners if we aren’t happy with a broken system. I would normally agree with him — until we start talking about the banks and the government, online security, wait times, and technology. The truth is, technology can be better. And we’re limiting ourselves if we settle for what we have today. With blockchain, our quality of life can be so much better. And the fact that a few white collar heads may roll sweetens the deal. Thoughts? Let us know in the comments.

What does this mean for both blockchain projects, and the blockchain space as a whole, moving forward?","title":"SelfKey Announces Partnership With LEXIT Marketplace","content":" Cryptocurrencies & PlatformsPress Releases SelfKey Announces Partnership With LEXIT Marketplace March 13, 2018 By Anna Snyder As the SelfKey ecosystem grows and their footprint expands, 2018 looks to be the year where they take on new challenges and embark on new partnerships. They are excited to announce their new partnership with LEXIT, a decentralized startup marketplace built on the blockchain that shows a great deal of promise for a complete overhaul of the Mergers and Aquisitions (M&A) industry. LEXIT deals with the exchange and licensing of companies, specialized departments, and Intellectual Property (IP). What does this mean? They deal with clients who range from startups looking to get out of the business, companies that want to sell or rent out working applications, and independent developers putting their code and other services up for sale. Moreover, LEXIT provides a valuable P2P network for sellers and buyers of IP, connecting them directly with each other and with appraisers and other specialists who can evaluate exchanges. Blockchain technology provides a safe and reliable infrastructure for doing professional due diligence required to verify offers. All the negotiations that take place on the LEXIT platform are carried out in a private, cryptographically secure space. Consequently, all parties involved must identify themselves and be validated to ensure that all interactions in the environment are safe, accountable, and free from fraud. Enter SelfKey SelfKey, as a blockchain-based digital identity system specializing in decentralized control of personal data, has the KYC onboarding software ideal for LEXIT’s purposes. SelfKey’s program is capable of satisfying the most stringent of KYC and AML/CTF requirements, as well as providing identification and vetting procedures for both individual and legal entities. In addition, through the SelfKey Identity Wallet, participants will be able to share their KYC profile with LEXIT and sign up with a single click. In the future with the Corporate Identity Wallet, not only individuals will enjoy instant authentication, complex corporate structures will also be able to do so. The Perfect Match SelfKey and LEXIT complement each other perfectly. They are both innovative blockchain platforms that strive to enable both individuals and companies to complete onerous manual tasks in a faster, more streamlined digital environment. Up until now, a start-up attempting to sell a business or a particular asset has several hoops they have to jump through, which include repetitive and redundant verification processes, wide-scale market research, and the search for a buyer, all of which waste time and eat away at profits. LEXIT provides a single marketplace that facilitates all of these pain points, linking entrepreneurs with appraisers and investors. Its platform disrupts an inefficient and outdated market, providing asset sellers with global exposure, lower costs, and saved time. And then there’s SelfKey, which gives users the capacity of easily and effectively identifying themselves and undergoing KYC processes, all the while staying in complete control of their personal data and documents. The SelfKey platform is incredibly versatile, covering all aspects of identity transaction for a wide range of clients. Service providers – in particular fintech start-ups – that utilize KYC protocol, will find SelfKey’s services invaluable. SelfKey provides the tools to overcome the stumbling block that KYC poses for companies, allowing clients to focus their time and resources on R&D and marketing their product. Certifiers, such as notaries, will also find the SelfKey technology invaluable when it comes to verifying identities, issuing, and monetizing digital identity attestations. Moreover, the SelfKey Identity wallet gives users access to a marketplace with a vast selection of immigration, financial, and cryptocurrency-related services, all of which they can access through the one initial KYC process – no repeats necessary – they completed when they created their SelfKey profile. The partnership between LEXIT and SelfKey is exciting news in part because the two projects have great synergy and will set a positive precedent for other platforms thinking of working together in the blockchain space. SelfKey founder Edmund Lowell sums it up: The fact that such an ambitious project as LEXIT has relied on SelfKey to carry out one of the most critical and sensitive process of its platform, the due diligence & KYC process, reaffirms SelfKey as one of the main players in a market that is expected to grow exponentially, giving us the opportunity to scale up our project quickly but sustainably. The Blockchain Ecosystem LEXIT and SelfKey’s partnership is a prime example of how cooperation between blockchain startups, and the synergy resulting from well-matched platforms, can reap increased rewards for everyone involved. Ultimately, we’re all working towards the same goal of decentralization and democratization of the financial sector, and the fact that SelfKey and LEXIT are working together to achieve this is a tremendous leap forward for the blockchain space as a whole. In time, this will result in fairer, more accessible, and more efficient platforms, with the added benefit of lower costs. LEXIT CEO Amir Kaltak has high hopes for the joint venture: Trust and accountability are among the most important ingredients for the success of the new e-economy in general, and for LEXIT’s M&A marketplace in particular. SelfKey, with their industry-leading approach to digital-identity services, facilitates this trust and will allow us to hit the ground running even faster. In addition to LEXIT, other blockchain startups, including Polymath and Invox Finance, are also joining forces with SelfKey. And, of course, with more platforms opting in to the SelfKey ecosystem, the more empowered they will be to advance their shared ambition of safe, decentralized verification of clients’ identities, resulting in greater freedom and privacy for consumers as a whole.

We look at the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, and what sets Ethereum apart.","title":"To the Moon! What’s the Difference Between Bitcoin and Ethereum?","content":" BitcoinBlockchain BasicsEthereumFeatured To the Moon! What’s the Difference Between Bitcoin and Ethereum? October 2, 2017 By Mike Hulleman Recent surges in the price of Ethereum have caused cryptocurrency traders on both sides of the Bitcoin vs Ethereum debate to question whether or not Ethereum may overtake Bitcoin as the most dominant cryptocurrency. In recent months the price of Ethereum has surpassed 30% of Bitcoin’s market cap at approximately $5 billion. And that’s quite the feat, considering Bitcoin had a six and a half year head start. All the recent press surrounding Ethereum has many people wondering; what’s the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum? The purpose of this article is to explore the key differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin –and what makes Ethereum special. The Difference Between Bitcoin and Ethereum Before investing into cryptocurrency for the first time, it is probably wise to have a firm understanding of what makes the two most popular cryptocurrencies different from one another. First, let’s look at some Bitcoin facts before we follow it up with Ethereum. What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a globally recognized open-source digital payment system that works without a central repository or a single administrator. Bitcoin transactions are verified and recorded by several unique network nodes on a distributed public ledger called a blockchain to ensure redundancy and prevent fraud or counterfeit. While the blockchain is the foundation of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin is purely a cryptocurrency and serves no other function. However, blockchain itself can serve countless functions (read our beginner’s overview). When Was Bitcoin First Introduced? Bitcoin was introduced on January 3, 2009 and it was the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency. One doesn’t need to speculate too much to understand that its introduction was a direct result of the 2008 financial crisis. Someone, somewhere wasn’t too pleased with the world being plummeted into the throes of an economic breakdown and decided to do something about it. The opportunities presented by Bitcoin appeal to both libertarians and professional traders alike. Also read: 10 Bold Promises Of Bitcoin Who Created Bitcoin? The creator of Bitcoin is known today only as an alias; Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi is likely not one person, but a group of persons — and although some have claimed to be Bitcoin’s infamous creator, it’s safe to assume the true face behind Bitcoin is still unknown (read: the self-proclaimed creator(s) of Bitcoin are full of it). How Many Bitcoins Exist? As of September 27, 2017 a total of 16,590,688 BTC have been mined and are theoretically in circulation –however with the number of Bitcoin wallets lost unknown, that number may not be a clear indicator of how many Bitcoins are in circulation. This also doesn’t reflect the number of coins which were lost or produced in the genesis block, as those cannot be spent. In all, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins. The reason for this is to create scarcity, which gives Bitcoin the added benefit of being a deflationary currency. Bitcoin has a controlled supply. What Is Bitcoin Mining? When applied to cryptocurrency, all mining refers to the process of adding transactions to a given blockchain. In Bitcoin’s case, this is known as the public ledger. Getting into the minutiae, Bitcoin’s block time is around 10 minutes. This is the time required to mine a block in the blockchain and confirm transactions. Reputable Investment in Bitcoin Bitcoin is a darling among investment firms, second only to Ethereum. Fidelity Investments is so supportive of Bitcoin they accept it in their cafeteria. Other reputable Bitcoin investors include Marc Andreessen, Barry Silbert, Blythe Masters, David Rutter, Adam Back, and JP Morgan –the latter of which has also been accused of abusing the market. In the curious case of JP Morgan, the CEO has publicly professed Bitcoin to be a bad investment (read: fraud) while his company has been helping clients invest in the cryptocurrency at a lower price due to the bad publicity their CEO is creating. Other firms are crying foul, and some groups have even filed lawsuits over their practice. Yes, this is the same JP Morgan which played a major part in the 2008 financial crisis, and we can only hope their comeuppance is drawing closer. China is also taking part in the fear, uncertainty, or doubt (FUD) with almost weekly up and down claims that range from government adoption and regulation to making cryptocurrency exchange illegal for individuals. It’s safe to assume governmental bodies will be testing the boundaries of cryptocurrency –or just kicking its tires, for some time to come. This is also why, going forward, you simply cannot believe everything you read. What Is Ethereum? Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is now a globally recognized open-source digital payment system that works without a central repository or a single administrator. Ethereum transactions are verified and recorded by several unique network nodes on a distributed public ledger called a blockchain to ensure redundancy and prevent fraud or counterfeit. So far, it sounds the same as Bitcoin, right? Well, the similarities end there. Ethereum is also a platform where transactions aren’t the only thing it facilitates. What makes Ethereum both groundbreaking and unique is the introduction of “Smart Contracts”. What Is a Smart Contract? From Wikipedia: “A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.” In terms of Ethereum, you can almost consider them apps that run on the Ethereum protocol, capable of just about anything an application can do; a site like Air Bnb could run entirely on a smart contract with a website wrapper. The entire internet could be reborn as a series of smart contracts — and it’d be better for it, too. Decentralisation of the internet would make net neutrality a moot point. But back to Ethereum today; from real-world government contract bids, asset tracking (think Fedex or leasing), and even healthcare — after all, humans are trackable assets, why not use it to dispense birth certificates? It’s mind-blowing at first, but once you understand it, you start to realize that Ethereum is much more than a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform for processing and tracking day to day business operations. They took what was working for Bitcoin and made it apply to just about any kind of digital asset. And any physical asset can have a digital signature –think serial numbers. The goal with Ethereum smart contracts is to provide security and redundancy that is superior to traditional contract law while reducing other transaction costs associated with contracting. When Was Ethereum First Introduced? Ethereum was introduced on July 30, 2015 with a focus on going beyond existing Bitcoin technologies –the creator of Ethereum was interested in created decentralized applications and in his own way, fixing where Bitcoin fell short. He saw more potential in the blockchain. Now that isn’t to say that Bitcoin is all bad. Some consider Bitcoin the gold to the US dollar; a tethered force that affects the value of all proceeding cryptocurrencies. Who Created Ethereum? The creator of Ethereum doesn’t hide behind a shroud of secrecy; its founder is a young Canadian-Russian, merely 23 today (born in 1994) and has been very clear about his role with the cryptocurrency. His name is Vitalik Buterin. He maintains Ethereum with a group of peers, and he provides a level of accountability that Bitcoin can never have unless its true creator comes out of the closet. Because Vitalik is so approachable, and there are checks and balances within the Ethereum camp, more governments and private organizations are willing to explore Ethereum. It’s accountability gives it legitimacy and the technology that underpins it is smart –which only makes it more attractive for investors to place their confidence in it. How Many Ether Coins Exist? Ethereum operates differently from Bitcoin in the sense that it’s not confined to a set number of coins, it’s set to a pace of coin production. So while it isn’t quite like Bitcoin in the sense that there’s a finite number of coins –it isn’t like the Federal Reserve Bank where they have a license to print any amount of US currency they wish. This ensures that it retains value to some extent in a deflationary way. However, it will likely not be as deflationary as Bitcoin. It’s like a more controlled version of the US dollar –what the US dollar probably should have remained as, before they untied it from Gold. What Is Ethereum Mining? Ethereum has a few similarities to Bitcoin in a general sense; mining is the process of adding “transactions” –whatever they are, to the Ethereum blockchain. However, as previously stated, those transactions aren’t limited to a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is –and they are no finite number of Ether coins. Ether mining can apply to all assets and/or smart contracts that pass into the blockchain. It’s a little more advanced. Rewards associated with mining Bitcoin is cut in half approximately every four years. It is currently valued at 12.5 bitcoins. To the contrary, Ethereum rewards miners based on a “proof-of-work” algorithm entitled Ethash. 5 ether is given for each block that is mined. Ethash is a “memory hard hashing algorithm”, which promotes decentralized mining by individuals rather than the use of more centralized technologies which Bitcoin uses. This also makes it more secure. “Bitcoin and Ethereum also cost their transactions in different ways. In Ethereum, it is called Gas, and the costing of transactions depends on their storage needs, complexity and bandwidth usage. In Bitcoin, the transactions are limited by the block size and they compete equally with each other” (Source). Reputable Investment in Ethereum Ethereum has a little more backing than Bitcoin these days. Like any younger sibling, Ethereum has had the opportunity to view the shortcomings of its older sibling and adapt to change. There is an Ethereum Alliance which currently boasts an ever-increasing number of partners. And for the sake of this article, I won’t number them, I’ll encourage you to take a look for yourself. You will recognize names like MasterCard, Deloitte, ING, Intel, JP Morgan (again), Microsoft, Scotiabank, and numerous other major, strongly financially backed businesses signing on to take part in this new crypto powerhouse. The lineup will change, although I only have seen it change for the better over the past 12 months. Needless to say, it’s a safe investment and free of much of the FUD that Bitcoin has been subjected to over the years. So, What’s the Difference Between Bitcoin and Ethereum? Both cryptocurrencies, like all currencies, are ruled by trust. That doesn’t suddenly go out the window. It would be stupid to think there’s a lack of trust in either when you see the names that choose to associate themselves with either respective cryptocurrency. However, crypto is the new kid in school. And all cryptocurrencies are either subject to courting or belittling by the most popular kids in #fintech school –the JP Morgans of the world. That shitty best friend when you’re trying to be a social climber. If you know high school politics, you know where this goes. I’d suggest Mean Girls as a great insight for the Every Person, but we all know how Lohan turned out. And then there’s the advent of smart contracts. I promise you this: they’re what you need to keep an eye on in terms of that investment portfolio. It is no longer about “my dad can beat up your dad” in the cryptocurrency world. There is no clear winner. It’s about which smart contract has the scalability the world is looking for. Cryptocurrencies have followed Ethereum and taken its lead. Ethereum heralds the first application of smart contract technology for cryptocurrency and blockchain, but it wasn’t the very first, ever, in the history of all smart contracts. Smart contract technology actually dates back to 1996. However, Ethereum is by far the most compelling application of smart contracts to date, that’s for sure. The blockchain solidified that. Just like the iPhone didn’t create anything new, it just did it right. That’s Ether. Final Thoughts In summary, it’s safe to say that both Bitcoin and Ethereum aren’t going anywhere for the foreseeable future. It is this writer’s belief that Ethereum will one day surpass Bitcoin due to its scalability, even far beyond financial markets. Anyone’s best bet is to buy and hold, however, experienced traders have the potential to make massive profits due to the ebbs and flows of these respective markets. What’s important right now is to understand that both of these currencies have longevity. And any one person or organization raising FUD likely has an agenda. All currency is built on trust, and when trust wanes it creates superb buying opportunities. With enough followers (or drone investors) anyone can do that. YouTube bloggers can do that. So, buckle up. When the world is this close to upending the financial industry’s status quo, it’s war. But in the words of the immortal Gordon Gekko, “Greed is good” — and in this case, it is greed that is likely going to bring both Bitcoin and Ethereum “to the moon!” This is a trader’s game. Many will ride this out and leverage the dips to their advantage. And if the JP Morgan’s of the world are doing it, it’s not so silly now, is it? I speak for myself as a writer; Ethereum and Bitcoin will both die one day –but today, Ether is a clear winner. What do you think? Let us know in the comments, we’d love to hear from you.

Fake news is spreading like wildfire. During the 2016 presidential election, fabricated stories favoring Donald Trump were shared on social media over 30 million times, according to a study conducted by Stanford University. It’s come out that Russian troll farms used hundreds of fake Twitter accounts to tweet in support of Brexit during the days before the vote. And just recently, it was revealed that more than half of the 21.7 million public comments in support of the FCC’s decision to end net neutrality were, you guessed it, completely fake. And that’s not the only problem we have on social media. Our personal data is being collected and used by companies that turn around and sell it to the highest bidder. Last quarter alone, Facebook raked in over $10 billion in ad revenue — all that money is made off the activity of its users and the collection of their data. What do users get from those billions of dollars in revenue? Nada. We’re basically allowing giant corporations to invade our privacy for nothing. Social media platforms depend on their users to create content, but the overwhelming majority of these sites provide creators with zero compensation. How Can We Take Back Control Of Our Social Experience? Such colossal problems require groundbreaking solutions. Luckily, we now have blockchain technology to aid us in the fight to take back control over our social media lives. The blockchain is proving to be a vital tool that is currently transforming the internet as we know it. Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a democratized social platform, decentralized on the blockchain, that truly serves its users? Say hello to Sapien — a democratized, tokenized, reputation-based social news platform capable of rewarding millions of digital content creators without any centralized intermediaries. Even better, Sapien shares advertisement revenue with its users. They set out their mission in their whitepaper: Our team believes it is now feasible to combine the innate human desire for social networks with the immense power of the Blockchain to give each individual unprecedented control over their online social experience. That Sounds Great… But How Will It Work? The team behind Sapien is building a new social media platform on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be fueled by a flexible cryptocurrency called SPN. The Sapien network will rapidly evolve to include a marketplace, various integrations, and third-party applications. Here’s a fun little video that explains Sapien in a nutshell: The platform is created with 4 core values in mind: Democracy – Users should have the final say over their communities and be incentivized to contribute. Privacy – Targeted advertising is profitable but inherently flawed because it exploits user data and infringes on user privacy. Free Speech – A fundamental principle that should be protected online with disruptive tools. Customizability – Each user should be able to tailor their social media experience to their liking. On the Sapien network, each user will be able to tailor their social experience to exactly fit their individual needs. Every element will be customizable. Maybe you want to use Sapien as a podcast aggregator, or maybe as a blogging site, or even a gaming platform. According to Ankit Bhatia, Sapien’s CEO and co-founder: The only limit of the platform would be the collective ingenuity of the community of users and developers. Sapien’s Key Features Sapien will have a treasure trove of unique features, with additional ones to be added along the way as they grow and expand. Public/Private Browsing – Seamlessly switch between public and private modes to experience Sapien with your real identity or anonymously. Subscriptions – Subscribe to branches to stay up to date with the latest posts from your friends and people around the world. Friends, Groups, and Posts – Add friends, create groups, share posts, write comments, and expand your horizons. Feature-rich Chat – Join text and voice channels with their powerful chat interface, which provides a more dynamic and engaging user experience. Encryption – Protect your online privacy. Sapien protects your personal data and offers encrypted chat conversations. Highly Customizable – Every individual is unique. Have control over every feature and tailor your own social experience. With all of these features, Sapien could prove to be a viable and popular alternative to current existing social media platforms. More and more people are increasingly getting fed up with the way Facebook, Twitter, and other social media companies are mistreating them — from selling their personal information to third parties, to bombarding them with ads they never asked to see. Sapien will allow users to have complete control of their relationship with advertisements on the network. By default, users will see no advertisements and no personal user data will be collected without a user’s knowledge. Here’s a visual of how the ad platform will run: Should a user decide to see ads, Sapien will split no less than 50% of all revenue generated with the user, in the form of SPN tokens. Furthermore, users can make even more revenue if they choose to stake SPN on Sapien. Power will be in the users’ hands to decide what, if any, data they want to share with advertisers. In return, users will be able to enjoy an even higher percentage of ad revenue for that shared data. The percentage of ad revenue received by a user will be based on a tiered system, with users receiving a greater percentage if they have more SPN tokens staked. To ensure transparency, all ad transactions will be publicly viewable on etherscan.io. With this setup, the Sapien team ensures that their users will retain full control over their experience on the platform. As Sapien’s CEO and co-founder puts it: Content creators are exploited by existing centralized platforms. A true online democracy should distribute wealth created to its citizens, instead of hoarding all of the profits. Sapien’s Decentralized Marketplace The decentralized marketplace will serve a key role in the tokenized economy on Sapien. The marketplace will enable SPN holders to purchase exclusive premium content, services, physical merchandise and virtual goods, including themes, integrations, and features. With reputation scores implemented, users can be confident that the vendor they are purchasing from is reliable and trustworthy. Sapien will only charge a 1% transaction fee to buyers and sellers on the marketplace, unless a user has a certain threshold of staked SPN. The minimum threshold will initially be set at the equivalent of $20 worth of staked SPN. If a buyer or seller has staked at least $20, then they will pay no transaction fees at all! Sounds Awesome? Here’s How You Can Get Involved There are a lot of ways to get involved and stay updated about the Sapien platform. Their ICO token presale is set to start on January 31, 2018 and will end on February 15, 2018. They will distribute a maximum of 10 million SPN. They will only accept ETH, with 1 ETH being equal to 4,000 SPN. Presale funds will be used to cover legal costs, fund the marketing campaign, and pay for the development of SPN. If you are excited about the philosophy and features of Sapien, consider investing in them! Check out their whitepaper and website to get the full details about what Sapien aims to do. The beta platform is currently live. If you are interested in registering, you can join the waitlist on their site. Here’s a little peek at what the beta platform looks like: To get involved in the vibrant Sapien community, you can join the Telegram group, as well as follow them on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. If the Sapien team manages to pull off this ambitious feat and provide the public with a truly democratic, transparent, customizable social media platform that doesn’t misuse and abuse its users, well, all we can say is: watch out Facebook, Twitter, and the rest. There’s a new player in town, and they actually play fair! It’s about time the social media world evolves to allow humans the pleasure of socializing with others all over the world, without being exploited by the companies that run these platforms. With Sapien, the power will be placed back into each individual users’ hands, and we will finally have the tools to run our social media lives exactly the way we want to.

January 6, 2018 By Daniel Frumkin Download the Brave Browser. Basic Attention Token ($BAT) is one of the most ambitious cryptocurrency projects out there. It was created to address the broken digital advertising system in which internet users must sacrifice their privacy and attention in order to use the internet for free. It’s a sacrifice that many of us are willing to make, as the alternative is having to pay to use services on the internet that we currently don’t pay for directly. But perhaps if more people understood the true cost of our digital advertising system, that wouldn’t be the case. The long-term aim of Basic Attention Token is to have mass adoption of a decentralized and transparent digital ad exchange, based on the blockchain. The Broken Attention Economy If you aren’t the customer, then you’re the product. For many people, the thought of paying to use online services like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or even Google is unfathomable. Yet, because we are the users, it’s easy to mistakenly believe that we are the customers of those service providers. That simply couldn’t be further from the truth. The real customers of all of these services are digital advertisers. They are paying for one thing, and that’s your attention. The more attention these internet platforms can garner, the higher their profits. Do you see the problem with this type of system? Incentives in the modern digital advertising system are completely misaligned. These Silicon Valley giants have utilized extensive research in behavioral psychology to ‘hack’ the human brain in order to keep (and sell) our attention on their platforms for as long as possible. Unfortunately, the most effective way to do that is to tap into negative human emotions like anger and outrage. As a consequence, higher social media use is correlated with increasing rates of depression and anxiety in our society. Moreover, the platforms can sell your attention for higher and higher rates the more they know about you. If, for example, you like some cryptocurrency pages on Facebook and are always searching for the price of various coins on Google, you’ll soon notice that you’re seeing advertisements for ICOs everywhere you go online. It’s incredibly difficult to maintain any semblance of privacy while browsing the web, and that has a lot of people concerned. Ultimately, things can’t continue the way they are. This is a massive problem in our society that needs addressing, and that’s why so many people are excited about BAT. You can learn much more about the inner workings of the attention economy and how to fix it from formal Google design ethicist Tristan Harris and his non-profit, Time Well Spent. What Does Basic Attention Token Do? Basic Attention Token is a token on the Ethereum blockchain that can be exchanged between content publishers, digital advertisers, and general internet users. With enough adoption, BAT would be more efficient and effective for all three of those demographics. Stage 1 of the BAT project is based on the Brave browser, a competitor of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and other browsers. Brave is available today, and the BAT team is constantly working to improve it and add features. As it is currently, Brave already provides a superior online experience compared to other browsers. It blocks trackers and ads, improves the loading speed of web pages and gives users greater privacy. For reference, the image below is a screenshot of my personal Brave homepage with approximately 1 month’s worth of data. Using the Brave browser does not require using Basic Attention Token, though it does make it possible to directly pay content publishers in BAT based on the amount of time you spend viewing their content. Even for people who don’t intend to personally use BAT at the time being, it’s worth downloading Brave and giving it a try. After you see and feel the difference of not being constantly bombarded by ads, you won’t want to use any other browser. As the number of Brave users has gradually increased, BAT entered Stage 2 of the project. The team is currently working on this stage, with the goal of increasing the utility of the Basic Attention Token itself. How Basic Attention Token Works In Stage 2, a new model for digital advertising begins to emerge. Rather than paying middlemen companies like Facebook and YouTube to run ads, that money can be paid directly from advertisers to users in BAT. Users can then turn around and use that BAT to pay their favorite content providers. The graphic below illustrates how each participant is incentivized to use Basic Attention Token in this model. Source: https://basicattentiontoken.org/ One thing that’s worth explaining more is how advertisers stand to benefit by participating in the BAT ecosystem. Google and Facebook use your browsing history to show you targeted advertisements, so how can advertisers get better targeting if your browsing data is private? Brave only changes one main variable in the process, and that’s the ownership of your browsing data. In the current model, that data is in the hands of the middlemen. In the BAT model, you retain ownership of your browsing data and allow for machine learning algorithms to match that data with relevant ads, without having it tied to your identity in any way. When it’s time for BAT to exchange hands, user privacy is maintained using zero-knowledge proofs – an awesome piece of cryptography that’s explained in this article for anybody who’s interested. You can read the Basic Attention Token whitepaper for a thorough explanation of the problems with the current attention economy based on extensive market research, as well as how BAT is being developed to bring about this new model of digital advertising. History of Basic Attention Token and Its Team The Basic Attention Token team began working on the project in the fall of 2016. They held an ICO in the summer of 2017 which successfully raised $35 million. Astonishingly, that entire sum was raised in just 30 seconds, as several investors with very deep pockets each bought huge sums. Part of the reason BAT garnered so much attention in its beginning stages is that it has a very high pedigree team. The project was founded by Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla and Firefox. Other team members boast similarly impressive backgrounds in the tech industry, with experience working on Tor Project, Yahoo, Khan Academy, Microsoft, AOL, and Netscape, to name just a few. So far, the experience and capability of the BAT team has been apparent in their execution of the project roadmap. However, it’s still early, and big challenges lie ahead. Competitors and Challenges for the Future If everything about BAT has sounded great so far, prepare yourself for a dose of reality. With great ambition comes great challenges, and that is certainly the case for this project. One need only hear the names of BAT’s top competitors – Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. – to know that there is a very long and difficult journey ahead if they are to achieve significant mainstream adoption. Many of us can likely agree that the digital marketing model BAT is trying to create would be better than the one we have presently. But how do you go about getting hundreds of millions of people to start using Brave when they are content with Chrome or Firefox? And in the event that Brave does become widely used, there’s still the obstacle of getting people to use BAT when many of them are just hearing about Bitcoin for the first time in recent months. While the project’s team and investors are generally optimistic, the feasibility of such a massive undertaking is questionable at this stage. All of that is to say that investors should proceed with great caution. If you believe in what BAT is trying to accomplish and are willing to invest in it, plan to do so for the long-term. Understand that the odds of BAT realizing their vision for a better future are slim. Most importantly, commit to playing whatever small role you can in making the BAT model a reality by using the Brave browser and paying your favorite content publishers with Basic Attention Tokens. Change isn’t going to happen overnight, but if it’s to happen at all, it will be in no small part because of early adopters like you and me. Last Thoughts People don’t like change. As long as services like Google and Facebook are ‘free’ for users, it’s hard to see them losing popularity any time soon. If it’s going to happen, change will likely start with a growing understanding of the true cost that each of us bears in order to browse the web. As stated in the BAT whitepaper, bandwidth to load advertisements can cost users up to $23 per month in data charges while also causing pages to load more slowly. Furthermore, advertisements can reduce the battery life of your phone or laptop by up to 21%. The reality is that we are paying with both our time and money to browse the web for ‘free’. And so, although the odds may be stacked against BAT succeeding, this is one of the rare projects that can make a significant, positive difference in the world. The question is, how much are you willing to risk on such an improbable dream? To get involved with the BAT community and learn more about the project, you can visit the official website or join the community on Reddit or Rocket.Chat. Download the Brave Browser.

{"url":"https://www.investinblockchain.com/how-to-secure-your-cryptocurrencies/","web_url":"https://www.investinblockchain.com/","type":"article","description":"","title":"How to Secure Your Cryptocurrencies","content":" Blockchain Basics How to Secure Your Cryptocurrencies October 22, 2017 By Mike Hulleman Everyone talks about the latest “Bitcoin hack”. But the reality is, Bitcoin has never been hacked — people were hacked. Their computers, their mobile phones, exchanges were compromised. Hell, even a stolen piece of paper can mean losing it all. After buying my first cryptocurrency (in my case, Ethereum), I went on to make my first trade and bought some Dash and Litecoin with my 90% profit margin. And then my laptop died. I was using Exodus then, and retrieving my cryptocurrency portfolio was as easy as entering 12 words (my passphrase) on a new computer. In this article, you’ll learn a number of different ways that cryptocurrency users, traders, or HODLers can store crypto in ways that are as futureproof as they are hackerproof (or laptop-deathproof). Cryptocurrency so Deathproof even Kurt Russel can’t kill it. How I Lost Didn’t Lose All My Cryptocurrency When My Laptop Died Exodus is a great cryptocurrency wallet solution. It’s a software wallet that is both beautiful to work with as it is secure. Mind you, it may not be the most secure crypto wallet on the market, but it sure comes close — for my needs. I get my latest operating system security patches. I don’t run bootleg software. I take precautions (almost of the “Beautiful Mind” level, a la Russell Crowe) with my internet browsing and security. (I don’t do Pornhub on any device I store my crypto on). I trust my computer for the most part, and I trust Exodus. Well, that’s what I did (and still do!). Then my computer died due to hardware causes without warning. Yet without access to my computer for a few weeks, I was still able to trust Exodus. I continued to buy crypto coins, send them to a wallet on a dead laptop, and diversify my portfolio because of how Exodus and all other quality cryptocurrency wallets work. With a new laptop in hand, all I needed to do was download the app, enter my passphrase, and thar she be (yes, I speak a little pirate). What is a Crypto Passphrase? What’s a passphrase? I’m glad you asked. It’s a 12-word password that’s randomly generated that you store offline (on paper, and not kept in your physical leather wallet). If you and your crypto wallet ever part ways, those 12 words are basically the embodiment of all your cryptocurrency. 12 words. A lifetime of pain if you lose them, let me tell ya. And I sleep like a baby, even laptopless. Because I know they protect me. When you’re dealing with a technology that is independent of a centralized banking system, it’s on you to keep your passphrase safe. And before I get into ways to secure your cryptocurrency, that’s my first lesson, folks. If your crypto wallet doesn’t use a passphrase that you can store offline, I personally advise against keeping your funds there. More on that in a moment. What is a Multi-Sig Wallet? As I mentioned in a similar article on my blog, “a multi-sig wallet, also known as a ‘multisignature’ wallet, refers to cryptocurrency wallets that require input from multiple parties in order to complete a transaction.” Basically, two keys (or more) are required to move funds through said cryptocurrency wallet. Not all wallets have this feature. If you’re sharing a crypto account with your spouse or a business partner, a multi-sig wallet is a must. Improve Your Cryptocurrency Security: Tips On Using Different Wallet Types Now that we’ve got passphrases and multi-sig out of the way, let’s look at the 5 types of wallets for storing cryptocurrency, and how you can use them securely. John McAfee describes how easy it is for malicious websites to root your phone and steal your Bitcoin. 1. Online Wallet An online wallet is like the Hotmail of Bitcoin — it’s not a very industry-grade solution, to say the least. It’s good for a time, but not long term. I only use an online wallet, on say, an exchange, before I move my funds. As in, I will only use an online wallet for minutes or hours. Why? They likely won’t allow you to keep your passphrase off their server. Both your cryptocurrency and your security measures are in one place. Hackers call that a honey pot. Whether you have a ridealong browser malware watching you engage with your online wallet or the online wallet provider itself gets hacked, it’s an incredibly volatile way to store your crypto. Don’t do it for long. See: Mt Gox. 2. Mobile Wallet John McAfee will scold you for using this type of wallet, too (see video above). But they aren’t all bad if you use your phone responsibly. A mobile wallet is another temporary wallet that you can use to transfer smaller amounts of crypto on a day-to-day basis. Make a purchase, send money to a friend — it’s a great intermediary for its convenience, but convenience comes with a security cost. Here where I currently live, the Philippines, I use Coins.ph to collect Bitcoin from my clients and then immediately cash it out at a bank machine (if I do that, I don’t always HODL) or re-transfer to more secure wallets. Worthy of note; I bought a new Oppo phone (a Chinese brand popular in Asia), may or may not have looked at risque internet websites, and later got Jaxx which is a leading crypto wallet for mobile. When I opened my account and viewed my passphrase, I heard a photo snap sound (screenshot). I can only assume my phone is rooted. I don’t use mobile wallets. You never know. Uninstalled. Coins.ph is a mobile wallet and online wallet hybrid — as in, no passphrase, less secure. No screenshot sound. I use it for minutes. I never keep funds on it. 3. Desktop Wallet Now we’re in Exodus land! A desktop wallet is a secure wallet you keep on your laptop or desktop PC. They usually allow you to store encryption keys (passphrases) offline, so if you lose your laptop, you don’t lose your crypto. If you play silly internet games, download non-app store approved apps, or look at porn, don’t use a desktop wallet. Always have one device that you keep virtually “factory OEM” — meaning that you don’t put anything on it that could compromise your security. 4. Hardware Wallet A hardware wallet is probably your best solution. It’s a purpose-built USB key that requires a passphrase and works offline. Its software is ROM-based, so it can’t be easily rewritten by a hacker. However, if you use it on a compromised machine, it’s bad news for all the reasons I’ve already stated above. A hardware wallet is ideal for storing your mother lode, such as the bulk of your Bitcoin. You pull it out on a weekly or monthly basis, not daily. For longevity, I suggest one that doesn’t require batteries although there are some really cool ones on the market. I suggest Ledger’s Nano S. 5. Paper Wallet Way back in the day before hardware wallets or any other crypto wallet, for the most part, paper wallets were the defacto standard for crypto “cold storage”. This means you print it and forget it. Bury it in your backyard. Stash it in a security safe. You get the idea. It’s a long-term crypto storage solution. A paper wallet is basically just your key and passphrase printed on a piece of paper with or without a QR. Since it’s entirely offline, it’s your safest, most secure cryptocurrency storage solution. Downside: it’s cumbersome. BitAddress.org and Bitcoin Armory can help you create and print your own paper wallet. Just do so on a porn-free, secure, non-malware machine! In Summary Nefarious websites can potentially compromise your online security and root your device. I thank John McAfee for that tip-off; although I won’t always trust a person who promotes a cryptocurrency too much (more on that in another article), he’s got a very substantial point. Buy a second laptop, avoid shady Russian antivirus, put your browser settings on paranoid-level-highs. So, at this point, I strongly recommend getting BitDefender, MalwareBytes, and turning off Javascript on any machine you’re going to use with crypto. Anything to add?

Our everyday life consists of solutions that others created to make life easier and simpler. One of the systems that has tremendous impact on how we live our lives today is money. Money is simply a universal measure of value. It makes people quantify their relevance and enjoy rewards based on it. People earn money when they do what others find useful, and with money they can obtain goods and services that they don’t personally produce based on how their society measures value. The current financial system today is based on paper money, famously known as fiat currency. These currencies are issued by the countries of the world and they are essentially based on the individual country’s resourcefulness and strength. It wasn’t so initially. For example, the U.S. dollar used to be backed up by gold bars held up in treasury by the Federal Reserve. But in 1971, the currency was taken off the gold standard and the USD became backed up by basically the reputation of the USA. At specific intervals, people who are high up the financial ladder get overwhelmed by greed or carelessness, and a crisis occurs. The most recent financial crisis, which happened in 2008, was led by a drastic decline in home prices in the US. The big problem was not the decline in the stocks, jobs, and asset value — rather it was the solution that was more disturbing. More money was pumped in to stabilize the economy without any additional value being created. Also, those who made the mistakes (i.e. the bankers) appeared to be rewarded by the solution (that is, government bailouts). It was no surprise that Bitcoin (BTC) rose from basically nowhere during the 2008 crisis, and began to build momentum. The idea was simple: a peer-to-peer medium of exchange of value. It was intended to cut out the bank’s control over money, and provide a means of exchange that is fixed in supply. This is a simplified case for cryptocurrency. While the crypto industry has come quite a long way from where it started, it is still not too late to invest in it. An investment in the crypto industry is currently the best expression to advocate for a change in the global financial industry. Aside from the fact that it has flaws, the current system is old, stale, and due for a change. Crypto has the capacity to provide financial inclusiveness to anybody wherever they may be. What is Bitcoin? If you think you’ve missed the boat when it comes to crypto, you actually haven’t. Here are 5 reasons why it is not too late to invest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Why It Is Not Too Late To Invest In Bitcoin And Cryptocurrencies 1. The Current Value of the Entire Cryptocurrency Market is Just a Fraction of the Worth of Some Companies Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision was for cryptocurrency to be the new form of money. The industry has come a long way since Bitcoin’s visionary whitepaper, but where it is today is still very small when compared to the money and financial value in circulation. The current total market cap of the crypto industry is just under $200 billion. This is significantly small compared to the current valuation of companies like Amazon and Apple. The valuations of these companies are what they are today despite the fact that they do not service up to half of the world’s population. Meanwhile, if cryptocurrencies achieves the long-term vision of becoming the new form of money, a large percentage of the world (if not all the world) would be using cryptocurrencies. To put it in a simpler sense, imagine what would happen if the 2 aforementioned companies decide to incorporate cryptocurrency into their systems. Currently, many crypto projects are forging partnerships that will enhance their usability and help accelerate real-world applications of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

To be modest, we could assume it would get to the point of being on the same level with gold. But considering crypto’s vision of replacing physical money, the upside is substantial. 2. Institutional Money is Yet To Be Priced In Cryptocurrencies are yet to governed by stable regulations. In fact, many authorities are still having a debate as to what the definition of “cryptocurrency” is. Some say it is a currency, some say commodity, others disagree with both. There are still concerns that the securities law could be applied to some cryptocurrencies. These doubts and concerns, and many more, have kept institutional investors from venturing into cryptocurrencies. Most of the value currently priced into cryptocurrencies is from tech enthusiasts, financial traders, and a few capitalists. Institutional capital, which is often very substantial and managed by big investment firms, has not yet ventured in the crypto industry. Morgan Stanley has already signaled keen interest, and Fidelity has already gone one step ahead. Others are expected to pick up to avoid being left behind. 3. The Crypto Industry Still Has a Lot of Room for Growth Even though cryptocurrencies already do solve the issues related to money transfer, the use of blockchain still has several issues that require resolution. Blockchain platforms have developers working to make them better optimized for their functions everyday. For example, Ethereum is still working on a solution to scaling and Bitcoin requires the Lightning Network to better handle high transaction loads. It can be said that the current market cap of the crypto industry reflects the current state of crypto projects. Only 36 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have working products thus far, which shows that the industry is still in its infancy. Another area for growth has to do with the current nature of the crypto market which seems to be largely driven by speculation and sentiment, rather than actual technological progress. It will take time for the market to mature, and become less influenced by sentiment and more driven by actual progress. As blockchain technology develops further and crypto investors mature, we could see exponential growth in the space in terms of both actual usage and market cap. 4. Crypto’s Potential as a Store-Of-Value in Times of Crisis One of the problems the world has with the current financial system is that people are conditioned to use the currency of the country they are from. While some have the privilege of living in countries with sound financial systems, others find themselves in countries that are not so responsible financially. Governments could make a mess of the financial industry and the people will have no choice but to stick with their national fiat currency. Cryptocurrencies are not state-owned or government-directed. They are not physical, and hence inflict no physical burden to carry. With a wallet address and private key or hardware wallet, cryptocurrency can be a store of wealth especially in times of crisis. Some recent examples include the case of Venezuela and the economic crisis of Zimbabwe. Bitcoin is often considered in this light, having a total supply of 21 million. It sounds reasonable to store wealth in the topmost cryptocurrency. If Bitcoin is recognized globally as a store of value, that will likely drive the demand for it. This is because people will be willing to buy and hold it, but will sell only as a last resort. 5. More and More Companies Are Working to Apply Blockchain Technology in Their Industry In July, 2018, Forbes listed 50 public companies exploring the use of blockchain technology. The list includes American Express, Oracle, IBM, Facebook, Comcast and more. The efforts these companies put into blockchain development is a positive sign for the future of the industry. While these developments may not have a direct effect on the value of current cryptocurrencies, the successful use of blockchain for other uses could have a spillover effect and encourage the adoption of of crypto as a whole. With so many companies already considering blockchain integration in their operations, it would not be surprising if we see massive growth in corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies over the next 5-10 years. Projects that are geared towards enterprises as well as those that provide Blockchain-as-a-Service will only serve to accelerate enterprise adoption. Conclusion Investing in cryptocurrencies is not just about buying the coins and waiting for a pump or price surge. Using useful skills to create or develop something in the space is investing. Creating useful products and services complimentary to the crypto industry can also be classified as an investment. While investments often involve buying coins, it doesn’t end there. The value of most cryptocurrencies has dropped by more than 70% (from their all-time-highs) in 2018. Many wished in January (during those highs) that they had bought Bitcoin at $6k. Now, at $6k, they are skeptical. This is by no means to encourage you to buy Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency at the current price — this is to give you a perspective of the mindset that goes into the investment process. Whether we like it or not, at some point in the future, the financial system will be completely changed. It’s just like the famous saying “change is the only constant.” The bankers have had their time, and crypto looks to be the next era in the financial sector.

When not reading or writing on crypto, he is analyzing a critical subject to simplify for other people. He plans to be one of the most respected voices in crypto in a few years. He lives on the internet. Read More\n\nCryptocurrency Writer\nThe quality of life the average person has today is a product of many years of innovation, invention, and production. Our everyday life consists of solutions that others created to make life easier and simpler. One of the systems that has tremendous impact on how we live our lives today is money.\nMoney is simply a universal measure of value. It makes people quantify their relevance and enjoy rewards based on it. People earn money when they do what others find useful, and with money they can obtain goods and services that they don’t personally produce based on how their society measures value.\nThe current financial system today is based on paper money, famously known as fiat currency.\nThese currencies are issued by the countries of the world and they are essentially based on the individual country’s resourcefulness and strength. It wasn’t so initially. For example, the U.S. dollar used to be backed up by gold bars held up in treasury by the Federal Reserve. But in 1971, the currency was taken off the gold standard and the USD became backed up by basically the reputation of the USA.\nAt specific intervals, people who are high up the financial ladder get overwhelmed by greed or carelessness, and a crisis occurs.\nThe most recent financial crisis, which happened in 2008, was led by a drastic decline in home prices in the US. The big problem was not the decline in the stocks, jobs, and asset value — rather it was the solution that was more disturbing. More money was pumped in to stabilize the economy without any additional value being created.\nAlso, those who made the mistakes (i.e. the bankers) appeared to be rewarded by the solution (that is, government bailouts).\nIt was no surprise that Bitcoin (BTC) rose from basically nowhere during the 2008 crisis, and began to build momentum. The idea was simple: a peer-to-peer medium of exchange of value. It was intended to cut out the bank’s control over money, and provide a means of exchange that is fixed in supply.\nThis is a simplified case for cryptocurrency.\nWhile the crypto industry has come quite a long way from where it started, it is still not too late to invest in it. An investment in the crypto industry is currently the best expression to advocate for a change in the global financial industry. Aside from the fact that it has flaws, the current system is old, stale, and due for a change.\nCrypto has the capacity to provide financial inclusiveness to anybody wherever they may be.\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nIf you think you’ve missed the boat when it comes to crypto, you actually haven’t.

The Power of Mobile Almost two billion people in the world do not have access to traditional, formal financial services – and not solely because of low income. The cost, travel distance, and paperwork involved are factors contributing to the time it takes to use traditional banks. Instead, people in emerging markets utilize an un-ledgered, underground economy that accounts for almost US$10 trillion per year. On the other hand, with Android devices available for just US$30, many people in developing nations now have access to small, powerful computers in the palm of their hands. Many of these users – accounting for 75 percent of the world’s mobile subscribers – are on prepaid plans and spend much more for their mobile data and airtime. In emerging markets, this mobile data and airtime functions as a currency. This mobile money can be easily transferred between phones, exchanged for cash, and used to pay for goods and services like utilities and groceries. How AirFox Is Answering This Call With its mobile platform, AirFox uses AirTokens and the Ethereum blockchain to provide the underbanked in emerging markets with much-needed access to mobile data and financial services. Users can utilize AirTokens to: Redeem for free or discounted mobile data and airtime supported by advertising Purchase physical and digital goods Send and make payments to friends and family around the world Apply for or lend peer-to-peer microloans to other users based on the likelihood to payback their loans based on anonymized mobile behavior With AirFox, anyone can easily give an interest-generating loan that will provide the unbanked and underbanked in emerging markets access to capital for goods and services in an instant. The AirFox Brand The foundation of the AirFox brand was built on a plug-and-play SDK adtech platform for prepaid mobile operators to provide more affordable mobile data through ad-sponsored, app-specific, or zero-rated plans in the US. After serving 2 million unique subscribers in the US, AirFox aims to bring similar accessibility to mobile users in emerging markets. AirFox is doing this through two products connected by AirTokens. The AirFox Android app is designed specifically for users in emerging markets to be secure, easy to use, and consume less mobile data. The app allows users to receive free, ad-sponsored AirTokens, purchase mobile data or airtime, buy digital or physical goods and services, build credit scores based on their mobile usage, and use that score to apply for and receive micro-loans. AirFox is also developing a decentralized app (Dapp) to make it easy for individual lenders and institutions to make anonymized loans to cohorts of borrowers in the Android app. AirTokens The AirToken is an Ethereum ERC20 utility token that is focused on delivering the following benefits to its target audience in emerging economies: Redemption of affordable, sponsored mobile data access Use of AirTokens to redeem physical and digital goods The global ability to lend and/or use micro-loans Smart contracts will power the Dapp to enable a global pool of lenders to provide capital to unbanked users at lower interest rates. AirToken is listed on HitBTC, EtherDelta, and Radar Relay. Advertising and Microloans Users of the AirFox app can opt in and allow ads to be shown on their device. An ecosystem of advertisers is built on top of the AirToken smart contract, so each user gets a share of the ad revenue for their awareness. Additionally, a decentralized application (Dapp) enables anyone in the world to lend to users on the platform. A smart contract allows holders to lend their AirTokens to users, who can then exchange the tokens for mobile data, pay essential bills, and purchase physical and digital goods. Users pay back their loan by opting to advertise or directly by converting fiat into AirTokens. AirFox: The Origins AirFox was started by co-founders Victor Santos and Sara Choi. Both met while working at Google and shared similar childhood experiences in Brazil and Korea where expensive telecommunication services is the norm. They teamed up to found an MVNO called Ciao Telecom, with operations in the US and Brazil. With lessons learned from Ciao Telecom, Santos and Choi successfully launched AirFox, a TechStars portfolio company with US$1.2M in venture seed funding and generating annual revenues of US$600k one year after seed funding.

June 13, 2019 By Jeremy Wall Cardano (ADA), the proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network built on peer-reviewed academic research, is being developed into a decentralized application (dapp) development platform with a multi-asset ledger and verifiable smart contracts. Cardano’s blockchain aims to be highly scalable, interoperable, and sustainable for real-world applications on an enterprise level to build the economy of the future. While that all sounds amazing, the project still has a lot of work to accomplish, and IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong), the parent company of Cardano, has released an updated roadmap outlaying progress towards its 2020 vision: Today, we're very pleased to share our completely redesigned roadmap, charting our progress towards the Cardano 2020 vision. Here's where we'll keep the community updated over the months ahead https://t.co/t1kjKY09lk #Cardano #CardanoCommunity #Blockchain — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) June 5, 2019 Cardano’s 5 Eras Cardano’s roadmap can be broken down to 5 eras, namely Byron (Foundation), Shelley (Decentralization), Goguen (Smart Contracts), Basho (Scaling), and Voltaire (Governance). Each of the eras is centered around a primary goal with various releases and developments throughout the era to achieve this goal. The eras are completed sequentially, with research and development of future eras overlapped with one another (some of the work is being done in parallel). The first era (Byron) was officially completed this year, and now the primary focus is on completing the Shelley era. Currently, Cardano is in the Gougen era but is still very much focused on Shelley, which is supposed to be completed by the end of the year. Shelley’s mainnet is now live, and as its development continues, research and development for Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire will begin in parallel. Cardano’s roadmap is only updated until the end of 2020. By this time, Cardano’s development is expected to be vastly completed, and the focus will be on the blockchain’s governance (the Voltaire era). See below, a visualization of the 5 Cardano eras, and how they are being developed in parallel with one another: Image Source: https://cardanoroadmap.com/ Final Thoughts As seen in the image above, the era we are currently in (Goguen) is right in the middle. It is intended to be one of the most formative eras of Cardano’s roadmap, as it’s tipped to be the one that brings mass adoption. However, IOHK is still working on finalizing Shelley, and then Goguen is set to be completed in the first half of 2020. By then, it’s expected that Cardano will have achieved a sufficient level of adoption with real-world use cases. A competing cryptocurrency project that has already achieved real-world adoption is Ethereum (ETH), which is being adopted by enterprise businesses such as Deloitte, Microsoft, Amazon, Ernst & Young, and others. Therefore, Cardano has some serious competition, and it will be interesting to see how these two projects compete once their roadmaps and blockchain technology are completed. Do you think there is room for both Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) to prosper? Let us know what you think in the comment section below.

We explain what they mean.","title":"Digital Assets and Smart Contracts: A Beginner’s Guide","content":" Blockchain Basics Digital Assets and Smart Contracts: A Beginner’s Guide November 30, 2017 By Jorn van Zwanenburg Upon entering the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, you’ve most likely come across the terms “smart contracts” and “digital assets”. Ethereum is the best known blockchain for the creation of smart contracts and digital assets, as are basically all cryptocurrencies. But what do these terms really mean and how are they relevant to you as a blockchain investor? Digital Assets Firstly, it’s important to understand what digital assets are. Assets are economic resources to which a value can be attached and that can be owned by a party. Moreover, an asset is expected to generate value in the future. Assets can be both tangible and intangible. Typical examples of tangible assets are property, machinery, inventories, precious metals and currencies. Intangible assets are goodwill, copyrights, trademarks and patents. With the growth of the internet, digital assets have made their introduction. They are subject to the same definition as regular assets; thus they can be owned and have an economic value. What makes them different from traditional assets is that digital assets are not in the physical world, but in the digital space. They are binary, thus in their essence they are combinations of 1’s and 0’s. Examples of digital assets are data, software, designs, electronic addresses, virtual items of virtual worlds and of course, cryptocurrencies. Most people have a hard time understanding the value of some digital assets as they are intangible and binary, which makes a lot of people believe that they have no intrinsic value. However, the current and continuously increasing value of the crypto market seems to provide evidence to the contrary. Smart Contracts Most contracts currently run through centralised systems which are operated by third parties. Whether you want to buy a house, a car or issue a new passport, you’ll have to go to a third party to complete the contract. A lot of back and forth interaction is necessary and these processes can be time-consuming because there are multiple unrelated parties involved who all need to supply and verify the appropriate documents. We currently need this system because it’s the only way we can validate the authenticity of documents and trust unknown parties. If you want to buy a house, the current owner wants to ensure that he will receive the money, the government wants to know who owns the house, and you want to make sure the house actually belongs to the proclaimed owner and verify the state of the house. All this costs time and money, both of which can be saved by employing smart contracts. Smart contracts are not much different from regular contracts, only they are executed automatically. A simple example of a smart contract is borrowing an ebook online. You select which ebook you want and you receive it. The exact date and time you received the ebook will be entered into the contract and when you’ve finished the ebook, the contract will be terminated and you pay for the time you had the ebook. No third party needed. Smart contracts are not a new concept; the only barrier is that they were extremely difficult to implement as they still needed to be verified by a third central party. Blockchain removes this need as blockchain technology is secured by its decentralised network. Documents cannot be tampered with on the blockchain, meaning that smart contracts can finally be efficiently and securely executed. Smart contracts are lines of code that are written on a blockchain. The codes represent agreements that are automatically conducted by computers or blockchain nodes. Once the contract is executed, this blockchain ledger is updated and the network can verify the completion of the contract. Source: Blockgeeks The sequence of smart contracts are like dominos. The completion of every term of the contract will automatically activate the next term until the contract is fulfilled. This logic is called ifthisthenthat and it is already used in, for example, subscription emails. Say you want to receive a weekly newsletter. You enter your email, and accept the terms and conditions. This automatically leads to you receiving a confirmation email, and once you confirm your email, you are subscribed and automatically receive the newsletter. Automation and no need for human interference is what makes smart contracts so promising. Instead of needing human verification on whether all obligations of a contract are fulfilled, the contracts will do this themselves. Parties that are unknown to each other can do transactions with one another without the need for trust. Blockchain verification provides trust. The contracts are stored on the blockchain and all parties will have access to the information on the blockchain. Every step of the smart contract is verified and stored on the blockchain in chronological order, making it possible to analyse the entire sequence of events within the smart contract. Smart Contracts in Real Life Let’s end with another example of how smart contracts can change the way the world works. Say you want to buy a secondhand car you saw online from someone else. You request the details and the history of the car (smart contract), which are stored (smart contract) on a blockchain. You like what you see and you’d like to take the car for a testdrive. You give the current owner access (smart contract) to the blockchain that stores your personal information (smart contract) as a guarantee. Let’s say the car is self-driving, and by giving access to your personal information, the car will drive to your house (smart contract). You like the car and decide to buy it. You transfer a cryptocurrency of choice to the seller, and simultaneously the car ownership is transferred to you (smart contract). As you can see, there is no bank, car dealership or institution needed for this transaction. This is just one of the numerous possibilities that smart contracts can fulfill. They eliminate the need to trust other parties and save time and money. Ethereum currently is the number one blockchain platform to build smart contracts on, and there are other smart contract platforms such as NEO, Qtum and Cardano.

Could BTC be an important hedge against the next recession?","title":"Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Upcoming Global Market Crash","content":" BitcoinNews Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Upcoming Global Market Crash June 19, 2019 By Jeremy Wall Bitcoin (BTC) has thus far flourished in 2019, surging 188% from its December lows of $3,150 to a recent high of $9,070 on May 30. This extremely bullish price action is contrary to the prices seen in traditional stock markets, as the world’s biggest economies have suffer from a minor financial downturn. As reported by Tuur Demeester, the founding partner of Adamant Capital, Bitcoin’s bullish price action could be attributed to international macroeconomic issues that tend to have a direct impact on Bitcoin’s price. Therefore, could Bitcoin be used as a hedge against an upcoming global market crash? US-China Trade War Positive for Bitcoin According to Demeester, the US-China trade war could be fueling this year’s bull run, as it is negatively affecting the Chinese yuan and appears to be positively affecting the price of Bitcoin. In his Medium post, he said: “On May 5th, the Chinese yuan started weakening against the US dollar, and 13 days later traded 2.5 percent lower — a huge move in forex terms. Remarkably, that was also the week that Bitcoin broke above the resistance of $6,500.” In addition to this, the Russian international television network RT also suggested that the trade war between the two economic giants could potentially be leading Chinese investors to abandon the yuan and seek out Bitcoin in anticipation of the yuan falling further. Investors in #China have been unloading yuan and moving into #bitcoin and other #cryptocurrencies in anticipation of inflation & possible devaluation – analysts https://t.co/6UIfO9g3tJ — RT (@RT_com) June 5, 2019 Furthermore, while Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is banned in China, Chinese traders are still managing to trade, and China has a vibrant over-the-counter (OTC) market, according to BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. Hayes said that just because OkCoin and Huobi have halted operations in mainland China, doesn’t necessarily mean they have exited the Chinese market. In fact, Hayes believes the Chinese cryptocurrency market is very strong, stating: “The OTC market is vibrant, and these venues have found politically acceptable ways to allow buyers and sellers to meet in China. Zhao Dong, arguably the largest OTC trader in China, is one of the main people responsible for the successful $1bn Bitfinex LEO IEO. He went on the record supporting Bitfinex to the Chinese crypto community, and his clout and network helped Bitfinex win back the Chinese traders. China still matters.” Do you think Bitcoin is being used as a hedge against an impending global market crash? Would Bitcoin thrive or suffer during a global market crash?

They've hit the milestone of 4 million monthly active users, just 2 months after reaching 3 million MAU.","title":"Brave Browser Goes from 3 Million to 4 Million Monthly Active Users in Just 2 Months","content":" Cryptocurrencies & PlatformsNews Brave Browser Goes from 3 Million to 4 Million Monthly Active Users in Just 2 Months September 5, 2018 By Ibrahim Ludwick Download the Brave Browser. The Brave browser is picking up momentum with leaps and bounds, growing from 3 million monthly active users (MAU) in July to 4 million at the time of writing. Latest @Brave stats: 4M users (MAU), 21K verified channels, 26K publisher accounts. We will step on gas w/ brave-core + BAT on mobile this fall, get past 5M easily by EOY, >= 12M next, adding BAT ad deals to token grants, making good on the promise of @attentiontoken economics. — BrendanEich (@BrendanEich) September 2, 2018 Brave, originally conceived by 2 former Mozilla engineers, is experiencing a great acceleration in growth. Brave was at 1.4 million MAU in February. By July, they hit 3 million—meaning growth averaged about 300,000 MAU per month. Their growth boosted even further between July and August, increasing to nearly 500,000 new users per month. So far, the Brave browser has had 10 million downloads, which means around 40% of the people who download it become regular users. Reasons for Brave’s Increasing Popularity This growth is driven by a number of factors—among them are increasingly annoying and invasive spyware and browser advertisements. The Brave browser features highly effective built-in ad and tracker blocking, which has been called controversial by some established figures in web development. Privacy is also another major concern that Brave addresses. The browser integrates support for TOR and automatically uses DuckDuckGo in incognito tabs, a search engine which stores no records of user searches. BAT Tokenomics Possibly the biggest driver behind Brave’s growth is the fact that it is riding the cryptocurrency wave with a high potential tokenomics model. Users can choose to see ads if they wish, and in exchange receive a share of revenue generated in the form of the Basic Attention Token (BAT). The Brave browser features a built-in BAT wallet. The program began testing in June. This makes a strong case for future demand (and thus value) for the token, since advertisers will need to purchase BAT in order to run ads, much in the same way that companies currently pay Google’s AdSense. In addition to this, Brave has already integrated tipping for content providers, with at least 14,500 YouTubers and 4,500 websites signed up so far. Brave Faces Stiff Competition Brave is certainly not the only browser serving the cryptocurrency market—Opera recently released a browser with a built-in cryptocurrency wallet. Since Brave CEO Brendan Eich was formerly a Firefox executive, it’s understandable he would want to try another direction. Firefox has steadily been losing market share to Google Chrome for the past several years. Trying to grab some of Google’s market share is no easy task. The tech giant’s browser currently boasts over a billion users. Brave is taking a clever approach to this problem, however. They’ve designed the upcoming version 1.0 of the browser to be compatible with Chrome plugins, meaning extensions built for Chrome will also work with Brave. This allows Brave to upgrade their user experience to match Chrome, thus benefiting from Google’s dominant position. It remains to be seen if Brave can actually be a credible challenger to Chrome, but if their present growth rates continue, it looks to be a top contender — or at the very least, a welcome alternative. The Brave browser is available for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, as well as for iPhone and Android, and can be downloaded here. Related: Should You Invest in BAT? (Opinion) Download the Brave Browser.

But that’s not all: Paul Solotshi Calder Le Roux employs similar spelling and language in his writing style to that of Satoshi. He’s interested in gambling (Bitcoin’s initial code had a poker client included), and what’s more, he’s been in jail since 2012 – that’s probably the reason why his 1 million Bitcoin hasn’t moved. On top of that, the documents included in this article show a connection of Craig Wright to Paul Solotshi. Sound like a 007 movie? Read also: It Looks Like Satoshi Has Been Found And Almost Nobody Talks About This Guy Yet? New Evidence Suggests Satoshi Nakamoto Is Paul Solotshi, The Creator Of Encryption Software E4M And TrueCrypt Let’s start from the beginning: The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous and enigmatic creator of Bitcoin (BTC) is perhaps the most enduring mysteries of modern times. It’s long been speculated as to who he, she, or they are, but to no avail — the long-standing mystery remains. There have been a number of theories and candidates as to who Nakamoto really is, some of whom are even self-nominated like Craig Wright, the man known as Faketoshi for his bold claims. Wright has courted controversy by claiming to be the creator of Bitcoin, which has led to multiple lawsuits and court hearings. One such court case, Kleiman v. Wright, has surfaced new evidence (in the form of a Wikipedia page which was not redacted), which, oddly enough, points to a new Satoshi candidate… and it’s not Wright. Who’s the New Satoshi Nakamoto Candidate? Image Source: https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-evan-ratliff-elaine-shannon-paul-leroux-20190215-story.html The newfound Satoshi candidate is Paul Solotshi Calder Le Roux, a 46-year old former cartel boss, drug smuggler, arms dealer, informant to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and genius programmer. As seen from Le Roux’s Wikipedia page, the man lived an eventful life with a career that included gold smuggling, precious metals mining, logging, land deals, drug and arms trafficking, money laundering, assassinations, encryption software development, and more. Also stated on Le Roux’s Wikipedia page: “Le Roux is currently in US custody for ordering the assassinations of six people.” Some readers may already be familiar with Le Roux’s life story, as it was presented in a series on Atavist along with a book titled “The Mastermind.” An excerpt summarizing the publications states: “He was a brilliant programmer and a vicious cartel boss, who became a prized U.S. government asset.” Paul in his early 20’s Image Source: https://magazine.atavist.com/he-always-had-a-dark-side Apart from Le Roux’s life as a cartel boss, he was also a brilliant programmer who created E4M, an open-source free Windows disk encryption software program, in 1999. As well, he is also suspected to be the creator of the open-source TrueCrypt disk cryptography package, which is based on E4M’s code. How did a man of this nature, with an extensive criminal background and some impressive programming contributions under his belt, come to be tied to Craig Wright’s court case and suspected to be Satoshi Nakamoto? Let’s delve into the evidence. The Kleiman v. Wright Lawsuit and Ties Pointing to Paul Le Roux Self-proclaimed Satoshi Craig Wright is being sued by the Kleiman family on accusations that Wright defrauded and stole over $11 billion worth of BTC and hard drives from the now deceased Dave Kleiman, a noted computer forensics expert who’s suspected by some to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright and Kleiman were business partners until Kleiman died in 2013. The lawsuit that’s unfolding in Florida courts has been filled with bizarre theories, misdirections, forgeries, and mistruths which were often presented by the defendant, Dr. Wright. Among the bizarre things brought forth by Wright is Document 187, “Dr. Craig Wright’s Motion For Protective Order.” According to Wright, some of the evidence that supports he is Satoshi and that the $11 billion worth of bitcoins is his own, includes sensitive information about his ties to criminals and his involvement in their apprehension and incarceration. Therefore, Document 187 has been redacted so that the criminals included in the document would not learn of Wright’s involvement with their arrests and seek repercussions against him. However, unfortunately for Wright, whoever was redacting the document failed to to blackout one of the corresponding footnotes that identifies the criminal kingpin in question, Paul Le Roux. Source: The unredacted footnote from document 187 As seen in the footnote above, a partial URL is visible that leads to a Daily Mail article that calls Le Roux a: “Real-life Bond villain behind a cocaine and gun empire spanning four continents who’s now turned super-snitch” Also, the unredacted footnote clearly contains a link to Paul Le Roux’s Wikipedia page, indicating that Le Roux may very well be one of the criminals that Wright is afraid of repercussions from. Image Source: https://www.asiasentinel.com/econ-business/us-authorities-write-end-crime-ring/ The Ultimate Theory That Paul Le Roux Is Satoshi Nakamoto and Craig Wright’s Role in All of It With the public release of Document 187, it’s now being suggested that Paul Le Roux may be Satoshi Nakamoto – and that Wright is in possession of encrypted hard drives containing Le Roux’s stash of the famously stationary 1 million bitcoins. But how does Craig Wright, Dave Kleiman, and Paul Le Roux all fit into this perplexing conspiracy theory? Per Document 187 and the unredacted information about Le Roux, there is a strong assumption that Le Roux is the unnamed individual that Wright talks about in the document. Therefore, information outlaid in the document combined with some theorization suggests that Wright was an employee of Le Roux, and also an informant who helped bring him down in 2012. Following this presumed tail of events, one anonymous Redditor suggests that Wright and his long-time friend and business partner, Dave Kleiman, managed to get their hands on Le Roux’s encrypted hard drives that hold 1 million bitcoins. However, unfortunately for Wright, all of Le Roux’s coins are locked away in secure TrueCrypt volumes (the cryptography encryption software suspected to be developed by Le Roux). Wright has spent years trying to crack these hard drives but with no success, which is why he has yet to prove he is Satoshi. Adding to the conspiracy theory, Wright’s close friend, Calvin Ayre, has set up warehouses of computers to try and crack the encrypted hard drives code, disguising them as a cryptocurrency mining farm. Meaning his mining activity is simply a front to make these massive data centers look legitimate. Therefore, according to this bewildering yet entirely possible theory, the reason Wright is setting himself up as “the real Satoshi,” is so when he finally cracks the encrypted hard drives and gains access to the 1 million bitcoins, he can attempt to legitimately sell them off. The image above is from a document in the Kleiman v Wright case and presents claims from Wright, where he states that he’s in possession of Kleiman’s TrueCrypt files that contain his stored Bitcoin. According to Wright, it may be possible to crack the code within 5-10 years. All in all, it has been speculated that the TrueCrypt files Wright is in possession of are not Kleiman’s, but in fact Le Roux’s. We understand that this is a lot to take in, and you probably still have doubts and many questions, which is completely understandable — this is a perplexing theory. But upon closer inspection, there are a lot of parallels between Paul Le Roux and what’s known about Satoshi Nakamoto. Strong Parallels Between Satoshi Nakamoto and Paul Le Roux Apart from the allegations of Wright’s association with Le Roux, there are numerous curious coincidences that support the case that the criminal mastermind Le Roux is Satoshi. 1. Paul Le Roux’s Alias is “Solotshi” Calder Le Roux In one of the many passports Le Roux owned, he goes by the name “Solotshi”, which sounds extremely similar to Satoshi. Image Source: https://magazine.atavist.com/he-always-had-a-dark-side 2. Le Roux is a brilliant programmer and familiar with C++, and so is Satoshi. Before Le Roux was known to be involved in an array of criminal endeavors, he was a brilliant programmer with an obsession for cryptography and privacy, much like Satoshi Nakamoto. As previously mentioned, in 1997 he began working on E4M (Encryption for the Masses), which is software capable of encrypting entire disks, with an option for plausible deniability (denying the existence of an encrypted volume). Moreover, Le Roux published a kind of manifesto that expresses ideals strikingly similar to those of Satoshi Nakamoto. As explained in Wikipedia: “In the ‘Politics’ section of the E4M website, Le Roux published a kind of manifesto stating that governments are increasingly relying on electronic data gathering. Citing projects such as Echelon, linked to the five nation states which would become known as the ‘Five Eyes’ more than a decade later, he stated that encryption is the only way to preserve civil liberties.” At the end of Le Roux’s manifesto, he states: “Strong Encryption is the mechanism with which to combat these intrusions, preserve your rights, and guarantee your freedoms into the information age and beyond.” Image Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20001204164900fw_/http://www.e4m.net/pol.html 3. Le Roux is suspected to have developed TrueCrypt – the encryption software protecting Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1 million bitcoins Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1 million bitcoins are allegedly locked away in secure TrueCrypt volumes, encryption software that’s based on E4M’s code. Le Roux is highly suspected to have been a part of a team of anonymous developers called the “TrueCrypt Team.” This suspicion is compelling because some of Le Roux’s former colleagues believed he had worked on it, but they couldn’t find any corroborating evidence, so it still remains a mystery. All in all, if anyone could have hidden wallets containing 1 million BTC, it would have been the creator of disk encryption software TrueCrypt. 4. Satoshi’s disappearance lines up with Le Roux’s new endeavors Satoshi disappeared in early 2011 to “move on to other things.” Around the same time, Le Roux transitioned from his field of software development to cartel boss. During this time, he experienced disruptions with his illegal global pharmaceutical business, RX Limited, when the US government and the DEA restricted distribution. As stated from Le Roux’s Wikipedia page: “Around 2011 Le Roux began to disappear for long periods of time, with none of his employees knowing his whereabouts. As US authorities were closing in on him, Le Roux took up temporary residence in Rio de Janeiro and planned his move there.” Le Roux’s disappearance and need to lie low coincides with Satoshi’s disappearance, indicating yet another strong parallel between the two. 5. A curious post from 2002 (7 years before Bitcoin was created), may have been written by Le Roux. In a forum post from 2002, 7 years before Bitcoin was released, somebody posted something that sounds an awful lot like an early idea of Bitcoin: It’s long been speculated that Satoshi himself wrote this post before actually creating Bitcoin, 7 years later. Even more interesting, the IP address of the author has supposedly been traced to the Netherlands – a country where Le Roux is known to have once lived. More Parallels Suggesting Le Roux is Satoshi: Both were wary of authority – Le Roux expressed this in his E4M manifesto, and Satoshi expressed this in his Bitcoin whitepaper. Both had an interest in online gambling – Le Roux is known to have participated in online gambling activities, and Bitcoin’s initial code had a poker client included. Both understood that a new digital payments system was needed to improve upon the difficulties of traditional payment systems. Le Roux dealt with clunky online payments in his online prescription drug market, and Satoshi expressed understanding of payments in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Both used similar spelling and language – “analyse, colour, defence, bloody, hard.” Le Roux was a multi-millionaire if not billionaire, and as such wouldn’t have needed to cash out his BTC once the price began rising. Is Paul Solotshi Calder Le Roux Satoshi Nakamoto? Despite all of the surface evidence that suggests Le Roux could be Satoshi Nakamoto, there are still reasons to believe this is not the case. For example, in 2009 when Satoshi was refining Bitcoin, Le Roux was already establishing himself as a cartel boss, and is known to have been drug smuggling and gun running. How would Satoshi be able to do all of this while also starting a forum and answering noobs’ questions about Bitcoin? Therefore, one could argue that Wright’s claim to an association with Le Roux are completely fabricated in an effort to show he was connected with the origins of Bitcoin. After all, Wright doesn’t have the best reputation in the crypto space, and few, aside from Calvin Ayre, believe a word he says, including claims that he created Bitcoin and is Satoshi Nakamoto. Therefore, everything Wright says must be rigorously fact-checked and treated with caution. However, if Wright’s dubious connection with Le Roux is true, and “Solotshi” is, in fact, Satoshi, it would be one of the most incredible stories ever told, and Quentin Tarantino would already be jumping on the film rights.

Le Roux is highly suspected to have been a part of a team of anonymous developers called the “TrueCrypt Team.”\nThis suspicion is compelling because some of Le Roux’s former colleagues believed he had worked on it, but they couldn’t find any corroborating evidence, so it still remains a mystery.\nAll in all, if anyone could have hidden wallets containing 1 million BTC, it would have been the creator of disk encryption software TrueCrypt.\nSatoshi disappeared in early 2011 to “move on to other things.” Around the same time, Le Roux transitioned from his field of software development to cartel boss. During this time, he experienced disruptions with his illegal global pharmaceutical business, RX Limited, when the US government and the DEA restricted distribution.\nAs stated from Le Roux’s Wikipedia page:\n“Around 2011 Le Roux began to disappear for long periods of time, with none of his employees knowing his whereabouts. As US authorities were closing in on him, Le Roux took up temporary residence in Rio de Janeiro and planned his move there.”\nLe Roux’s disappearance and need to lie low coincides with Satoshi’s disappearance, indicating yet another strong parallel between the two.\nIn a forum post from 2002, 7 years before Bitcoin was released, somebody posted something that sounds an awful lot like an early idea of Bitcoin:\n\nIt’s long been speculated that Satoshi himself wrote this post before actually creating Bitcoin, 7 years later. Even more interesting, the IP address of the author has supposedly been traced to the Netherlands – a country where Le Roux is known to have once lived.\nDespite all of the surface evidence that suggests Le Roux could be Satoshi Nakamoto, there are still reasons to believe this is not the case.\nFor example, in 2009 when Satoshi was refining Bitcoin, Le Roux was already establishing himself as a cartel boss, and is known to have been drug smuggling and gun running. How would Satoshi be able to do all of this while also starting a forum and answering noobs’ questions about Bitcoin?\nTherefore, one could argue that Wright’s claim to an association with Le Roux are completely fabricated in an effort to show he was connected with the origins of Bitcoin.\nAfter all, Wright doesn’t have the best reputation in the crypto space, and few, aside from Calvin Ayre, believe a word he says, including claims that he created Bitcoin and is Satoshi Nakamoto.\nTherefore, everything Wright says must be rigorously fact-checked and treated with caution.\nHowever, if Wright’s dubious connection with Le Roux is true, and “Solotshi” is, in fact, Satoshi, it would be one of the most incredible stories ever told, and Quentin Tarantino would already be jumping on the film rights.\nWhat do you think about the Paul Le Roux and Satoshi Nakamoto connection?

October 27, 2017 By Mike Hulleman In this article, you will learn the only real substantial difference between US banknotes and Bitcoin that matters. Bitcoin vs US Banknotes There’s a term that’s lightly floating around the cryptocurrency discussion like fresh snow. Gingerly peppered into one article, and then another, floating whimsically into one ear, or eye, and back out the other. And the truth is I think this term needs to fall on all of our heads like a bag of bleeding hammers. That term is “deflationary currency” and it’s going to change your life. When you think of the word grape, what do you imagine? That synthetic lollipop flavor, or an actual grape? When I hear “grape flavored”, I think “purple flavored”. Ah, yes. The flavor of purple. Why Am I Saying This? Because humans are conditioned to forget the past over the course of a single generation and be reprogrammed to associate words and ideas to other words and ideas. If you hand a child real fresh-pressed grape juice, it will taste foreign to him or her. It’s healthier, but unknown. All they know of grape is purple. Now, take money for instance. Specifically, the US banknote. I could use just about any national currency today as an example, but I like picking on this one. Money. In your mind, it means a positive value. When we have it, we don’t think of it as a debt, we think of it as a plus 1. If you have $10 US dollars, you can add something to your life. Like put a sandwich in your face or buy a bottle of beer. Isn’t that nice. But value — the goods and services you can buy with that 10 bucks — changes over time. And usually that change means buy less with the same 10 dollars. Isn’t That Strange? No, it isn’t. Why? Because humans have accepted inflationary currency as the norm in as little as a single full generation (maybe a few years more, but you get the idea). And that’s terrible. As I’ve written before; “Yesterday a five dollar US note could buy you a meal, today it struggles to buy you a head of lettuce. It’s still $5 USD on paper, but its value is a moving target. According to the US Inflation Calculator, $20 in 1913 would pass for $494.86 at the time of writing this (August 2017)”. What Happened? Over time, your money went from being tied to gold (deflationary, finite) and became an IOU from the Federal Reserve Bank (inflationary, ever-expanding). We were bamboozled. I wrote a little about that here. If I were to use a blockchain metaphor to explain Keynesian economics I’d say it’s like we give someone the right to edit the global financial ledger as they see fit. But it is more complicated than that — I’ll get to it in a moment. Bitcoin as a Deflationary Currency The value of Bitcoin will only increase until it plateaus and the last Bitcoin is mined (issued). It might jerk up and down but it’s the oldest cryptocurrency and we’re seeing it stabilize today, right before our very eyes. Why Will the Value of Bitcoin Increase? The value of Bitcoin will increase over time because there are only going to be a finite number of them. This is why we call it “digital gold”. Like gold, Bitcoin is a finite (albeit digital) resource. Each is tracked uniquely in Bitcoin’s immutable blockchain to ensure no one “cooks the books”, like they did in the years that led up to the financial crisis. In other words, no “derivatives”, no IOUs, no meddling, no issuing new Bitcoins beyond a predefined number, and no inflation. When the last Bitcoin is issued, there will be 21 million of them in circulation. Actually, there will be less — some people have lost their passphrases and their Bitcoin is lost forever. A finite number and scarcity: all the magical attributes of an investment that will steadily increase in value for the foreseeable future. Opposing Theories This is where it gets complicated. All of this inflation vs deflation talk arises from two schools of thought; Austrian Economics vs Keynesian Economics. Austrian Economics Keynesian Economics Deflation is good! Free markets Gold standard, finite resource Savings Investment Let inefficient corporations fail Oldest continuous school of financial thought Deflation is bad! Government control FIAT currency Debt Consumption Bail out inefficient companies In all of US history, our best times were those under the Austrian school of economic thought. They were a time of prosperity. Until the Great Depression. Why do We Use the Keynesian Economic System Now? You see, neither system seems to be a perfect match for society. Banks keep moving around the furniture, and the government can’t keep up. Bottlenecks and a lack of transparency, all over the place. Austrian economic thought was challenged during the Great Depression, so we threw the baby out with the bathwater and later introduced Keynesian economics. (Penned in the 1930s by John Maynard Keynes). As you’ll read here, you will learn that Keynesian economics aren’t working very well, either. “Keynes rejected the idea that the economy would return to a natural state of equilibrium”. Keynesian thinking dictates that a deflationary currency will drive prices so low that everyone will be poor and businesses won’t invest in innovation. And in many ways, both sides were right on many points. The economy needs tending to 24/7, in real-time, at a level of transparency that a body of people (banks, or the government) simply can’t (be trusted to) manage alone. Until 2009, when Bitcoin came along. Could blockchain technology change global economics for the better? Bitcoin and a Third School of Economic Thought It’s only a matter of time before the entire economy is run on a series of smart contracts. The future may not be Bitcoin, but it sure is likely it’s going to be saved by blockchain technology. Russ Roberts, professor of economics at George Mason University, explains that a fixed supply of money is certainly different. However, the rate of deflation posed by Bitcoin will occur at such a controlled rate that markets will have time to adjust. “Elaborate controls to make sure that currency is not produced in greater numbers is not something any other currency, like the dollar or the euro, has.” “That is considered very destructive in today’s economies, mostly because when it occurs, it is unexpected,” says Roberts. But he thinks that won’t apply in an economy where deflation is expected. “In a Bitcoin world, everyone would anticipate that, and they know what they got paid would buy more than it would now.” Is It Too Late to Invest in Bitcoin? For those wondering if it’s too late to invest into Bitcoin, the short answer is no. Yeah, it might be worth $5,500 USD as I write this article today –but look at it as a sliding scale. A percentage point on a return, not an expense. The value of Bitcoin will likely continue to rise. Everyone has heard the guy at the water cooler say “I almost invested in Bitcoin when it was $5, $100, or even $1,000”. If Bitcoin reaches $500,000, that’s still two more zeroes than you started with if you jump in today. And if things keep going the way they are, it likely will reach $500k say forward-thinkers John McAfee and Jeremy Liew. In Conclusion Both Austrian and Keynesian schools of economic thought have run their course. Today, inflation is firmly cemented into our lives. Both systems have run the globe into the ground. But if we HODL on and start exploring a third popular economic system, perhaps we can do away with inflation once again and stabilize the global economy by choosing to use a hybrid economic system based on a deflationary currency and creating a more transparent, autonomous economic system.

We discuss the potential combination of virtual reality (VR) and blockchain.","title":"Virtual Reality and Blockchain: a Killer Combo?","content":" AnalysisBlockchain BasicsFeatured Virtual Reality and Blockchain: a Killer Combo? January 23, 2018 By Jorn van Zwanenburg Let’s combine blockchain technology with virtual reality (VR)! It sounds super exciting, combining technologies of the future. However, not every proposed combination of technologies works, or even makes sense. With the ICO mania of this year, entrepreneurs are looking for buzzwords to receive millions of dollars in funding, and combining VR and blockchain fit right in this category. Do they go together though? There are a few crypto-issuing companies that have been combining blockchain technology with VR such as Voxelus, VibeHub and Decentraland. These projects raise key questions: at what stage is the VR industry at the moment, does it make sense to combine VR with blockchain, and can the two technologies boost each other? Let’s dig into it. The Virtual Reality Industry No matter how you put it, our reality is kind of boring. We know what our environment looks like, and we and our environment regrettably have to abide to the laws of physics. Virtual reality is paving the way for an alternative reality, one that only exists digitally. The idea of VR has been around since the 70s; however, our technology hasn’t been able to create virtual worlds and applications until recently. Not much different from the current blockchain and crypto craze, VR experienced the same levels of exuberance. After the launch of the Oculus Rift, tech investors were certain VR was going to change everything regarding entertainment and would rapidly move to disrupt other industries. This excitement was, typically, tackled by realism after which VR stocks plummeted. The VR industry has been continuously developing, now with more realistic expectations. Both VR hardware and software have been gradually improving in capabilities and decreasing in cost. We haven’t seen the true potential of VR by a long shot, and don’t forget that with new technologies, people generally overestimate the impact on the short term and greatly underestimate its impact in the long run. That being said, the VR industry still has a long way to go. The hardware is expensive and requires a lot of computing power. If someone opts to go for cheaper and weaker hardware, the frames will be delayed which leads to disappointing experiences and could cause VR sickness. Sales have been rather disappointing. The Sony Playstation VR has only sold a little over a million headsets globally since October 2016, Facebook’s Oculus Rift has completely lost momentum and customers, and HTC has sold Vive, its VR division. These are the setbacks VR has experienced in the short run. In the long run, tech and industry experts still envision a bright future for VR. VR has thus far mainly been mentioned as a disruptive force for the entertainment industry. However, there are other uses for VR; educational, scientific and training applications seem highly promising and are rapidly being developed. We’ll likely see more applications for VR as the hardware becomes cheaper, a framework for VR software is developed, and when the market is buying VR headsets en masse. Are VR and Blockchain a Match? While the VR industry is gradually developing, the blockchain market is exploding. These two very exciting technologies stimulate one’s creativity as the possibilities of both seem limitless. This makes you wonder: is there a justifiable combination of the two technologies that can make us super excited, or are we just combining two buzzwords? There are several reasons why blockchain technology has us so excited, and some of them can be applied in VR. The main elements of blockchains, that are also applicable to VR, are the elimination of third parties, micro-economies, unique and limited assets, smart contracts and unfalsifiable proof of ownership and intellectual property. Let’s see how these characteristics relate to VR technology. Storing Data Content created for VR can be safely stored with the use of blockchain technology. As of now, there is no set industry standard for this. Blockchain technology provides an excellent way of storing VR data and is superior to the methods we currently use. Benji Rogers discusses this concept in depth and proposes a .vr format for VR content. This would mean that VR would cause a shift from DVDs, Blu-ray and USB to a whole new data storage system, completely based on the blockchain. As VR is a very young industry, there are no set industry standard for this yet, meaning that it could easily implement a blockchain solution. This is in contrast to current entertainment and software industries which are highly dependent on existing storage solutions. Blockchain technology could make an entrance into the mainstream by being the backup system for VR applications. Watching and Protecting Copyrighted Material In a future where the two technologies of blockchain and VR are combined, the protection of copyrighted materials would be much easier. Say you have a VR headset and you want to watch a movie. Through the use of a smart contract, you’ll rent a movie you like, watch it and after you’ve seen it, the smart contract will be terminated and you can’t access the movie again without paying for it. If we were to run, for instance, VR movies completely on the blockchain, each uploaded movie will have to be accepted by the blockchain network. This means that the creator of the movie will be identified, and once the movie is allowed to enter the blockchain, the movie and its producer are set in (binary) stone. Any attempts to upload a movie that’s already on the blockchain will easily be noticed by the network. This has an additional important quality, namely that it will be easy to identify any creator of content and directly pay the creator of content for his or her work without the interference of third parties. Once accepted, the movie will be tokenized, meaning that the movie will be a non-divisible, unique and identifiable unit on the blockchain. To gain access to the movie, you’d have to adhere to the requirements set by the owner of the movie, which will generally mean that you pay with crypto to see the movie. Copying a movie from the blockchain will be the same as copying a bitcoin, thus close to impossible. Same goes for VR games, software packages, educational programs and whatever we come up with over the next few years. Research Projects Blockchain would allow for VR cooperation in the form of open-source projects, intellectual cooperation and user-generated content. Users are able to work together on open-source projects in a virtual environment, while every adjustment and improvement is stored on the blockchain and the contributors will be updated. Academics can do their research in perfectly global teams while keeping unwanted eyes out. This might seem like something possible without VR, but imagine archeologists, Mars venturers or astronomists. These scientists are limited to locations and equipment such as telescopes and archeological sites, or an inaccessible planet like Mars. VR allows scientists to store these visual properties in a virtual environment, making it possible to collaboratively observe a supernova, build a virtual colony on the red planet or explore an ancient Aztec ritual site. Blockchain allows this data to be safely stored, protects it from tampering and gives an incredible new dimension for research and discoveries Unlimited Virtual Worlds Although the above two examples are solid combinations of the two technologies, they are not the most powerful potential applications. The ultimate combination of blockchain and VR that we can imagine now is intriguing to say the least. The most exciting mix of VR and blockchain technology are immersive worlds. Endless, digital worlds in which everything we can imagine can come true. According to former Disney imagineer Jesse Schell: I think it’s very likely that whatever is the Space Invaders of VR is going to have a strong user-generated content component. At first, you might think that this solely extends to gaming, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. We’re talking about full-on, lose-yourself, digital worlds in which people’s brains walk around, interact, trade, consume and express themselves. Pre-blockchain, we needed companies to create worlds like that. They have to run the servers and make sure the game remains exciting by providing updates. These companies would be in full control of every component of the game. An online world such as World of Warcraft is managed by a central party. If Blizzard Entertainment, the company behind WoW, went bankrupt, thousands of online lives would vanish. Even though this might not be the worst thing that could happen for the users’ health, this means that financial malpractices of a single company could take something important such as a virtual environment away from thousands of users. The decentralization of these worlds prevents that from happening. With the use of blockchain, the data of these worlds would be permanently and securely stored. Every user or inhabitant of such a virtual world can simultaneously function as a host or server. With an increasing number of players, it will become increasingly hard for a digital world to disappear. Well, immersive worlds could still disappear; but it would be based on the decisions of the market. Everyone capable of programming VR applications can start developing a virtual environment and, if other users like it, this world will grow. If they don’t, the world will die out and users will simply move to another digital space. We’ll be able to enjoy virtual worlds that are governed based on pure democracy through smart contracts and voting tokens. Blockchains do offer the same deal to the real world, but because of the way our world is constituted, it could take a very long time, if ever, for this to actually happen. Those in power are never too inclined to share it. Additionally, items created and owned in such virtual worlds are secured by the blockchain they run on. Developers that create value through new items, quests, characters and structures can protect their creations in the blockchain and earn crypto by selling them. And what will they sell these binary assets for? You guessed it, cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are made for digital environments and they operate perfectly in it. I’m not saying it’s advisable to do so, but if you want to challenge someone to a game of FIFA and add some monetary stakes, all you need is a smart contract and a digital currency. Doing that with fiat money would be more troublesome and harder to enforce. I can imagine walking through a virtual world and seeing a mind-blowingly beautiful casino which offers gambling. I play some cards, win some Litecoin and be on my way. I stroll down a virtual marketplace, where developers are selling their latest creations. I decide to spend my recently-won Litecoin on a jetpack and fly back to my flying waterfall apartment, hopefully to turn the headset off and return to the real world. A Killer Combo These highly promising combinations of blockchain and VR technology surely promote the idea that VR productions should focus on integrating blockchain technology in their development. The idea of decentralized virtual worlds, open-source scientific research in 3D environments and copyright-protected entertainment with profits going directly to its creators are intriguing to say the least. As of now, there are only a few companies working on combining the two technologies; however, there are huge opportunities in this space yet to be grasped. I’ll surely keep my eye out for any developments in this cross-technology space, as I’m exuberantly excited by the possibilities of it. Let’s go virtual, with blockchains.

Founded by industry leader, Edmund Lowell, and backed by a team of over 70 individuals, SelfKey is making real inroads in the digital identity space. Users can also access a broad range of products and services such as citizenship and residency by investment, company incorporation, fintech products, among others. Their latest announcement is that they have begun testing an Alpha version of their Identity Wallet. SelfKey Identity Wallet Dashboard The SelfKey Identity Wallet is a desktop application that aims to take the difficulty out of current digital identity usage. Issues like data breaches are common and current KYC processes are slow, onerous, and insecure. Through an innovative use of blockchain technology, SelfKey is allowing people to have a reusable KYC profile that is under their control alone. Although this is just an Alpha test, users will be able to create a SelfKey ID, a two-part KYC profile that includes both “attributes” and “documents”. Documents are personal identifiers such as a driver’s license, social security card, utility bill or financial statement. Attributes are pieces of data that help substantiate a digital identity. Examples include name, date of birth, email, address or tax ID numbers. Security is at the heart of this wallet’s design and the above-mentioned data points are stored on the owner’s device and only shared with express consent from the owner. The wallet has a number of other notable functionalities and supports Ethereum-based tokens. This means that users can transact in ETH or KEY (SelfKey’s native token) and they can also track their portfolio’s performance using pricing data pulled from the CoinMarketCap API. In keeping with the current Alpha stage of development, SelfKey is carrying out a controlled and selective distribution of its wallet to members of its community. The aim is to get real user feedback and improve the UX before the product is rolled out to the public. SelfKey is still testing additionally functionalities internally. The initial testing group consists of 40 community members that were filtered through a survey conducted in recent weeks. This pool of testers will be added to sporadically and the application process remains open. SelfKey Founder Edmund Lowell had this to say about recent developments: We are tremendously excited to start sharing the work done during these last months with our community. For us, it is a very important step to know their opinion and it will serve us as a safe way to improve our product and make it more user-friendly. Although we are satisfied with the work done these last three months, this is only the beginning. We keep working very hard with our partners to integrate the SelfKey wallet with their platform, in addition to actively seeking new partnerships to increase the SelfKey Wallet and KEY token utility, and the value offered to our community as quickly as possible. SelfKey raised upwards of $21 million dollars during its token sale, and they’ve been extremely active ever since. Unlike many in the blockchain space, SelfKey already has a functional product, they have a KYC onboarding web app and have collaborated on a number of other token sales, most notably Airswap, CoinJanitor and Invox Finance. SelfKey has also established some strategic partnerships with Kyber Network, Polymath, and LEXIT. They’ve also branched out and developed ties with some non-blockchain companies such as the corporate services provider NTL Trust and two Caribbean international banks, both of which plan to offer services in the SelfKey marketplace. The SelfKey marketplace is one of the functionalities that is still being ironed out internally. Once complete, it will allow users to go through instant KYC processes for a range of products and services at the heart of investing and financial maneuvering. These include cryptocurrency exchange accounts, bank accounts, immigration by investment programs and company incorporation. If you’d like a closer look at the SelfKey Marketplace, a demo is available on their official website. To learn more about SelfKey’s vision and stay up to date with news, visit https://selfkey.org.
