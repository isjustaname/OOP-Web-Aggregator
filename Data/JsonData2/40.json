They must address the issues of high pricing and user experience to remain competitive, especially against riskier, lower-cost platforms.\nThe CBN’s decision to lift the ban has positively influenced public opinion about digital currencies.\nHowever, the SEC’s pace in providing regulatory guidelines and licensing approvals is a significant factor for these businesses.\nAs the industry awaits further clarity, startups are preparing to adapt to a regulated crypto environment that promises growth and stability.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

Their collective goal is to significantly reduce the number of stablecoins in circulation, a key step believed to aid in stabilizing the ecosystem.\nBefore this plan can be set into action, it awaits the approval of the community through a vote on the proposed contract migration.\nBefore the release of the US CPI news, the market saw varied reactions. The price of LUNC fell, trading at $0.000113, while USTC experienced a surge to $0.02636, likely in response to the anticipated burn.\nThe 24-hour price range showed LUNC between $0.000111 and $0.000118, and USTC between $0.02576 and $0.02727.\nInterestingly, while LUNC’s trading volume decreased, USTC’s slightly increased, reflecting the market’s response to the upcoming changes.\nAs the Terra Classic community awaits the outcome of the vote, the proposed burn and contract migration represent a pivotal moment for the ecosystem.\nThese actions are expected to have a significant impact on both the supply stability and the future market performance of USTC.\nWith developer Fragwuerdig at the helm, the community looks forward to a successful execution and the positive changes it may bring.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

They are scheduled to appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul G. Levenson in Massachusetts and U.S. Magistrate Judge Valerie Figueredo in New York.\nAttorney Damian Williams emphasized that the brothers’ actions undermined the integrity of the blockchain, which many rely on for secure transactions.\nThe IRS-CI New York Cyber Unit led the investigation, using advanced technology and traditional investigative methods to trace the stolen cryptocurrency.\nSpecial Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso highlighted the unit’s role in financial crime investigations, saying they will continue to follow the money trail to solve complex cases.\nThe Peraire-Bueno brothers face serious legal consequences, with each count carrying a potential 20-year prison sentence. The case remains a significant step in addressing the challenges posed by new technologies in financial fraud.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

He points out that despite Bitcoin nearly doubling its value in just five months, there doesn’t appear to be an overheated market—suggesting room for further growth.\nAdditionally, he highlights current macroeconomic conditions such as strong short rates and a robust U.S. dollar as catalysts that could propel Bitcoin’s price even higher.\nThe founder of 10tfund also made it clear that he believes investor enthusiasm can overcome regulatory hurdles posed by figures such as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.\n“Markets more powerful than bureaucrats,” Tapiero stated confidently on X (formerly Twitter), emphasizing his belief in the power of U.S investors who feel they have been left out of participating fully in BTC investments.\nSurprised.#Bitcoin    up almost 100% in 5 mo and not feeling frothy. Doubters still everywhere. X even a bit sedate. US short rates still 5%! USD strong.#BTC    shocking acceleration up feels imminent. Break of 70k goes right to 90k… Then 150k-200k this yr.🚀 pic.twitter.com/CEHb0A6Oos\nWhile Tapiero’s bullish stance reflects a growing optimism among certain segments of the crypto community, not all analysts share this view.\nRenowned trader Peter Brandt supports a similar bullish trajectory but cautions that failing to maintain above specific thresholds could dampen these high expectations.\nOn the other side of the debate stands Peter Schiff—a vocal critic known for his skepticism towards cryptocurrencies—who warns investors about betting too heavily on assets like Bitcoin due to their inherent volatility and dependence on broader economic factors such as USD stability and inflation control measures.\nDespite these contrasting viewpoints, one thing remains clear: The discussion around Bitcoin’s future price is far from settled.\nAs investors navigate through varying opinions and analyses presented by industry experts like Tapiero and Brandt or critics like Schiff—the path forward requires careful consideration of both optimistic forecasts and cautionary tales surrounding digital currency investments.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

A combination of better graphics, global smartphone reach, and internet","title":"The Transformational Role of NFTs for the Gaming Scene","content":" NFTs: Empowering Gamers with Ownership and Monetization Opportunities\nThe gaming industry has undergone tremendous advances in the past two decades. A combination of better graphics, global smartphone reach, and internet connectivity have contributed to the industry ballooning in recent times.\nNow, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are elevating the landscape even further with innovative ways to add value to gamers.\nNFTs are part of the broader transformation brought about by the blockchain. The idea of community participants having more ownership of the platforms they belong to is a common theme across such platforms.\nA central tenet of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain is decentralization. It essentially means that the crypto community governs the network and can exchange the coins/tokens among themselves in a permissionless network.\nThis empowerment is transformational both in the financial and gaming sectors.\nCryptocurrency took off in the mid-to-late 2010s, with Bitcoin taking the financial sector by storm. It has had its ups and downs, but the industry is now more established than ever.\nSome of the uses of the blockchain transcend finance only, and this technology continues to gain interest globally.\nFor gaming specifically, gamers had long been accustomed to all-powerful gaming studios that released games on their terms. Players have for long had issues with the limited control of in-game items and their ability to monetize gaming items and time.\nThese are the issues that blockchain games aim to alleviate. Creating games that give players greater autonomy over their in-game items, creating gaming communities that rely on user participation, and improving monetization opportunities for all participants.\nRegular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are fungible. This quality means that one Bitcoin is freely interchangeable with another. Similarly, a $20 note is exchangeable with another $20 note. Five twenty-dollar notes are exchangeable for a $100 note.\nA non-fungible unit of currency is unique and cannot be exchanged with another. The coding standard for these unique cryptocurrencies means that each is unique and can be identified from the next.\nAccordingly, NFTs have found applicability in areas that need unique identification, such as rare art and memorabilia. The NFT scene had an explosive rise in 2021 with several NFT auctions fetching millions before the craze subsided somehow as the sector matured further.\nNFTs are uniquely applicable to gaming where gaming items like Pokemons, gaming weapons and skins, and much more require unique identification.\nFor instance, NFT gaming platform Appxplore (Icandy) is unveiling an NFT collection for its blockchain game CryptantCrab Prime to elevate the gaming experience beyond mere gaming.\nThe game is a spinoff of the successful CrabWars game, with the introduction of Primordials NFTs. These NFTs are prized possessions within the game, with players able to utilize and monetize them freely beyond what was possible with traditional in-game items.\nSuch is the vitality of gaming NFTs. Players participate in a blockchain ecosystem that allows them to collect and enjoy the privileges of rare NFTs, participate in game governance, earn real rewards for gameplay, and play to earn more tokens available on such platforms.\nNFTs are a growing fixture in the gaming landscape. This tool ensures players can gain more than what was available under legacy gaming systems.\nPlayers spend billions of dollars each year, and their efforts, both economically and in terms of gaming hours, need better appreciation.\nThis leap in gaming allows innovators like Crab DAO to issue gaming items with unique attributes and tokens as a community to further enhance community integration into gaming ecosystems.\nDecentralized gaming and digital ownership of gaming items will play an increasingly vital role in this sector in the future.\nREAD NEXT\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

However, we have been in active discussions with Binance on this matter since September 2023, and thus far, our proposal to implement Exchange Addresses has been received positively.”\nWhile no official confirmation has been provided by Binance regarding the removal of the monitoring status, the Firo core team is confident that once Exchange Addresses are implemented, Binance will take the necessary steps to address regulatory concerns, ultimately leading to the removal of the monitoring tag.\nPrivacy coins, facing heightened scrutiny from regulators worldwide, have experienced delistings on various exchanges, particularly in Europe.\nThe new MiCA regulations pose challenges to the listing of cryptocurrencies offering anonymization features. Firo, in response to these challenges, is actively exploring options to comply with exchange requirements while maintaining the privacy of its users.\nThe Firo team welcomes the ongoing dialogue with Binance and appreciates the exchange’s openness to collaboration in finding a mutually beneficial solution.\nAs the crypto industry navigates evolving regulatory landscapes, Firo remains committed to ensuring compliance while safeguarding user privacy.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

This assertion points towards a strengthening support level that could underpin future rallies.\nThe veteran trader’s current stance marks a notable shift from earlier cautionary advice he provided in October when he warned traders about getting overly excited about a temporary rally in BTC’s value.\nAt that time he advised preparedness for a possible pullback come November.\nDespite these warnings and having witnessed recent sharp declines in its value after hitting new all-time highs initially this year; Vay’s latest predictions suggest confidence in not just recovery but substantial growth beyond current records.\nAccording to him “Bitcoin is going to surprise people to the upside,” citing projections ranging up till now as conservative compared with what lies ahead.\nThis positive forecast amidst previously volatile conditions reflects growing optimism among some investors regarding long-term prospects for digital currencies especially with advancements like spot market ETFs coming into play.\nAs such developments unfold they continue attracting attention from both individual and institutional participants looking towards potential gains in crypto investments over coming years.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

They do this by placing buy and sell orders in the order book of an exchange.\nThis activity ensures that there is enough volume on the trading pairs, reducing the volatility and making the market more stable.\nMarket makers effectively act as wholesalers in the financial markets by holding an inventory of a particular asset to facilitate trading.\nThe spread is a crucial component in the trading mechanisms of cryptocurrencies. It represents the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask).\nA lower spread indicates a more liquid market, whereas a higher spread suggests less liquidity and higher transaction costs.\nMarket makers capitalize on the spread to make a profit, by buying at the bid price and selling at the ask price. Their ability to maintain a low spread is beneficial for traders and the market’s overall health.\nMarket makers significantly impact asset valuation in the cryptocurrency market. By ensuring liquidity and a lower spread, they make assets more attractive to traders, potentially increasing trading volume and, indirectly, the asset’s valuation.\nHowever, it’s crucial to note that market makers are not directly involved in setting asset prices; they influence the market dynamics through their operations.\nEthical practices are pivotal in market making. Issues such as price manipulation, wash trading, and using privileged information can tarnish the market maker’s reputation and the integrity of the market.\nTransparency, adherence to regulations, and fair practices are essential in maintaining a healthy trading environment.\nThe cryptocurrency market making landscape is in a state of constant evolution, heavily influenced by advancements in technology.\nSophisticated algorithms are becoming the backbone of market making strategies, significantly enhancing efficiency and the capability for rapid decision-making.\nThese algorithmic solutions are adept at processing vast quantities of data, interpreting market trends, and executing orders at speeds unattainable by human traders.\nMoreover, the integration of robust technological infrastructures is playing a pivotal role in risk management.\nBy utilizing these advanced systems, market makers can better monitor market movements, manage large volumes of orders, and mitigate potential risks associated with high-frequency trading in the volatile cryptocurrency markets.\nThe role of cryptocurrency market makers is integral in ensuring market liquidity, stability, and efficiency. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the importance of ethical practices, robust risk management, and advanced technological integration in market making will become increasingly prominent.\nUnderstanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency trading space, from individual traders to large institutional participants.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

To do so, it has posted a Litecoin wallet address for donations specifically to this cause. So far, the address has received 2.5 litecoin, worth $240.\nNormal cryptocurrency transactions involve making the transaction data publicly available. This has the downside that blockchain analytics providers can build up profiles of who is sending how much money to whom. Currently, crypto transactions are far less private that the current banking system—let alone cash payments. In contrast, private transactions use cryptography to hide the transaction data, enabling people to keep their financial transaction history private.\nSome blockchains already offer this ability including Monero, which makes transactions really difficult to follow along the blockchain, and Zcash, which uses such cryptography to fully hide transaction data—although few people use its privacy preserving features.\nHowever, paying people to research and code private transactions is expensive since the cryptography is so complex few people can get their head around it—let alone program it. And with the Litecoin Foundation spending its money on promotional deals with the UFC, it needs further funding to build out features for the network itself.\nIt will also focus on developing the Lightning network, a second-layer scaling solution built on top of the Bitcoin network. Additionally, funds will go towards building standalone Litecoin wallet LoafWallet.\nIn the past two months alone, the coin has been added to Binance’s Singaporean exchange, and been accepted for buying flights and hotels through a collaboration with TravelbyBit. But now it’s time for the hard graft to begin.\n\nSource\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

Introduced initially in Sefwi Asafo during its pilot phase last year, this digital version of the local currency (CBDC) aims not only to modernize financial transactions but also curb financial crimes effectively.\nDr. Bawumia expressed optimism about these technologies playing pivotal roles in fighting corruption across Africa. He encouraged other nations present at the conference to consider similar approaches that utilize advanced tech solutions like digital forensics which can disrupt corrupt practices comprehensively.\nFollow BITNEWSBOT on Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, and Google News for instant updates >\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

Many of these digital assets operate within blockchain technology which","title":"A Beginner’s Guide To Cryptocurrency Mining","content":" Cryptocurrency is considered one of the most popular forms of financial assets today. Many of these digital assets operate within blockchain technology which works as a digital ledger or tracker. This ledger is then duplicated in several computer networks for confirmation. To properly make use of crypto coins, certain people may need to mine crypto coins which helps verify numerous transaction resulting in increased security levels.\nTo start, here are some facts you need to know about cryptocurrency mining:\nAccording to this explanation of cryptocurrency mining, this process involves using a spare computer or any computer to help solve various calculations needed to confirm a specific coin. This is done by examining the history of a coin within a blockchain which is divided into several blocks. Once these algorithms are verified, users can then expect to receive cryptocurrency as well as transaction fees depending on the coin’s nature.\nThe term mining is due to the fact that you create these coins out of algorithms and computations, the same way you would mine minerals from a cave. However, mining is not an easy endeavor and it would take a lot of investment to pull off.\nCryptocurrency mining is a great hobby to have for anyone who is interested in crypto coins but don’t have the necessary means to buy several coins and start a trading career. Compared to active investors, miners make significantly less since they don’t have direct contact with the market itself and they often need more money to start.\nNevertheless, if you’re interested in starting a mining hobby or business, here are some tools and equipment you’ll need to get started:\nMining Rig\nSince mining may require several hours of uninterrupted processes, users should use a spare computer they no longer use since it won’t interfere with their daily computer activity. It’s important to know that your rig will have its health decreased over time. Here are the minimum optimal requirements of a mining rig:\nHard drive or hard disc space of at least 200 GB or 200 gigabytes. Some currencies, like Bitcoin, may require additional space for program download prior to the actual mining operations.\nSince the verification process requires real-time automatic machinations, budding miners should invest in a stable internet connection that allows them to connect to the internet almost instantly.Unreliable and unstable internet connection could end up with you repeating processes.\nDesktop computers that run for more than 6 hours combined with continuous mining exudes a lot of heat which can tamper the computer’s overall system. To keep your desktop safe from external problems, invest in cooling systems like fans and an airconditioning unit to keep your setup and environment from breaking down.\nThe operating system of your laptop or desktop PC should be at least Windows 7/8.x/10, Mac OS X or Linux.\nThis is the most crucial component of the mining process, and the most expensive. If you want to succeed in mining, you have to first consider getting the best possible GPU for mining.\nThe download should sustain up to 500 MB or 500 megabytes in a day which means that the current data provider should allow over 15 GB or 15 gigabytes worth of download in a month. The upload should sustain up to 5 GB or 5 gigabytes in a day, which means that your data provider should allow over 150 GB or 150 gigabytes worth of upload in a month’s time.\nThe RAM should be at least 1 GB or 1 gigabyte for the actual mining.\nCoin wallet\nThis is a private database that allows miners to store their earnings. Some of which may include online, software and hardware versions.\nMembership in an online mining pool\nThis allows you to connect with other miners who more or less can share their knowledge about the mining process. Memberships also provide you the chance to seek new opportunities since many of these mining pools have discussion boards.\nMining software package\nThis software includes features that allow you to verify various cryptocoin transactions almost instantly. Many of these softwares are available as readily downloadable files over the internet. Prior to downloading the software, make sure your computer has the necessary RAM, hardware storage, and updated operating software to match the software’s requirements.\nIt’s hard to say on whether or not someone should start a hobby in mining since it depends on numerous factors that can affect their decision. If you’re unsure on whether or not mining is right for you, consider weighing in the pros and cons of starting this hobby, like:\nPros:\nAdditionally, crypto mining also has a few downsides, some of which include:\nCons\nWhile cryptocurrency mining is certainly important, people should view it as a hobby instead of a legitimate source of income. While miners do get paid, people should understand that since it doesn’t involve direct interaction with the market, its return of investment levels are significantly lower compared to active investors.\nImages via Shutterstock\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

Legislation like the Fit for the 21st Century Act is aiming to provide this clarity.\nMeanwhile, companies like Coinbase are stressing the importance of clear and consistent regulations and are calling for cooperation between regulators and the industry to create regulations that protect consumers while also encouraging innovation.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

The financial products and services mentioned in this article are not eligible for the UK. Cryptoassets are classified as Restricted Mass Market Investments in the UK, meaning that they are high-risk investments and are not suitable for most retail investors.\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has captured the imagination of developers, investors, and enthusiasts alike.\nWhile many are familiar with its role as a decentralised platform for building smart contracts and decentralised applications, several lesser-known facts about Ethereum may surprise even seasoned observers.\nCoinsdrom, a regulated crypto exchange, has prepared five intriguing tidbits about this groundbreaking blockchain network:\nEthereum was conceived by Vitalik Buterin, a young programmer and cryptocurrency enthusiast, in late 2013.\nInspired by the potential of blockchain technology beyond Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Buterin outlined his vision for a more versatile and programmable blockchain platform.\nEthereum’s whitepaper, published in 2013, laid the foundation for what would become one of the most influential projects in the cryptocurrency space.\n2016 Ethereum faced one of its most significant challenges with the infamous DAO hack.\nThe DAO was an intelligent contract-based investment fund built on the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to democratize venture capital funding.\nHowever, a vulnerability in the DAO’s code was exploited, leading to the theft of approximately €50 million worth of Ether.\nThe incident sparked a contentious debate within the Ethereum community and ultimately resulted in a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain to reverse the hack, leading to the creation of Ethereum Classic.\nGas is a crucial concept in the Ethereum ecosystem, representing the fee required to execute transactions and smart contracts on the network.\nEach operation on the Ethereum blockchain consumes a certain amount of gas priced in Ether.\nThe concept of gas ensures that the Ethereum network remains efficient by incentivizing miners to prioritise transactions based on their gas fees.\nEthereum is undergoing a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0, or ETH 2.0, to improve the network’s scalability and sustainability.\nOne of the critical components of Ethereum 2.0 is the transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\nThis shift will reduce the energy consumption associated with Ethereum mining and enable faster transaction processing speeds.\nEthereum 2.0 is being rolled out in multiple phases, with the beacon chain, the first phase, already live.\nAccording to Coinsdrom opinion, Ethereum’s versatility and developer-friendly ecosystem make it a standout platform in the cryptocurrency space.\nEthereum’s support for smart contracts and DApps has fueled its adoption across various industries, including finance, gaming, and decentralised finance.\nWith ongoing upgrades and improvements, Ethereum continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible with blockchain technology, solidifying its position as a cornerstone of the decentralized internet.\nThese lesser-known facts shed light on Ethereum’s fascinating history and evolution, highlighting its pivotal role in shaping the future of decentralized applications and digital finance.\nYou can buy and sell Ethereum at Coinsdrom. As Ethereum continues to innovate and grow, its impact on the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem will endure, driving forward the adoption and utility of blockchain technology on a global scale.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

The protocol eliminates the need for constant and complex bridges between different blockchains, making the process of interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) much smoother.\nUsers will no longer need to be aware of the underlying processes involved in accessing another chain, fostering an improved experience and greater accessibility.\nTo illustrate the utility of AggLayer, consider a user on an Ethereum layer-2 chain X1, who holds Dai and wishes to purchase a nonfungible token on Polygon’s zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM).\nWith AggLayer, the user doesn’t need to bridge their Dai to the zkEVM in advance. From their perspective, the process is as straightforward as dealing with a single chain, allowing them to interact with dApps effortlessly, without the need to understand the complexities of chain interactions.\nAggLayer is not just another addition to the blockchain space; it’s an evolution. Traditional monolithic blockchains like Bitcoin process everything from transactions to data availability within a single layer, which can lead to limitations in scalability.\nModular blockchains, such as post-merge Ethereum, distribute these functions across multiple layers to address these issues.\nAggLayer takes the best of both worlds, enhancing the integrated and modular architectures through the use of ZK technology, which leads to improved efficiency and scalability.\nPolygon Labs isn’t stopping at the initial launch of AggLayer in February. Plans for a second iteration of the protocol later in the year are already in motion.\nThis version will support cross-chain transactions without both chains needing to be online at the same time.\nAs Polygon Labs continues the development and refinement of the AggLayer protocol, their goal remains steadfast: to forge a unified, highly scalable network that brings together the diverse world of blockchains.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

Learn the key elements that drive demand and establish a digital currency's worth in the market.","title":"What Creates Value in Cryptocurrency?","content":" What makes crypto hold such value?\nTable of Contents\nDid you know that in just the last decade, Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, soared from a few cents to tens of thousands of dollars?\nThat’s the kind of stuff that can turn a pizza into a million-dollar meal if you paid for it with Bitcoin back in the day!\nThis makes a lot of people wonder, what really makes these digital coins valuable? If you’re reading this, chances are you’re scratching your head trying to figure out why something you can’t even hold can be worth so much.\nMaybe you’ve tried to get in on the action, but the ups and downs of the market are giving you a real headache.\nYou’re not alone. A lot of folks find it tough to understand the whole cryptocurrency thing. It’s like you need to be a tech wizard and a finance guru all at once, and even then, the rules seem to change overnight.\nIn this article, we’re going to break it all down. I’m going to show you what’s behind the numbers and buzzwords, and by the end, you’ll have a clear picture of what drives the value of these digital currencies.\nSo stick with me, and let’s figure out this whole cryptocurrency value puzzle together.\nCryptocurrency values really depend on how much people want them and how many are up for grabs.\nPeople wanting to buy more usually means prices go up.\nAs someone who really likes the independence that cryptocurrencies provide, I’ve spent a lot of time getting to grips with what makes their prices change.\nWhen lots of folks are looking to buy, it shows there’s a high demand, and this pushes up the prices.\nTake Bitcoin, for example. It’s only ever going to have 21 million coins. This limit is like saying there’s only so much digital gold out there, making sure its worth isn’t watered down by making too many (like the FEDs are doing with the Dollar)\nWhen there aren’t enough cryptocurrencies for all the interested buyers, the prices tend to shoot up.\nSometimes, the people behind a cryptocurrency will destroy some coins on purpose. Similar like the diamond industry destroys diamonds to keep the prices high.\nThis makes them even rarer, and can really make prices jump if more people want to buy at the same time.\nThe situation is always changing, with supply and demand bouncing up and down because of how people feel about the market, what investors are doing, and new tech developments.\nBig-time investors (a.k.a Whales) can really swing things around. They’ve got a lot of money and can snap up a bunch of coins, pushing prices higher by showing there is demand and when the price is up to the point they like, sell them all causing the prices to fall.\nCryptocurrencies get a lot of their worth from how useful they’re and how many people use them.\nThese things decide if a cryptocurrency is actually handy and if a lot of different kinds of users like it.\nIf a cryptocurrency becomes more useful, like being part of new apps or systems, often more people want it.\nThat happens because people are looking for cryptocurrencies that do more than just let them bet on prices going up or down.\nFor example, some tokens let people who own them make decisions about how a network should change. This can make more people want these tokens.\nThe big point is that when more people start using a cryptocurrency, it starts a “good cycle“.\nMore use means even more people will use it. This is important because even if a cryptocurrency is really new or smart, it only really matters if people use it for real things.\nThe mix of good technology and lots of people using it’s what can keep demand strong.\nIn short, for a cryptocurrency to do well, it’s not just about having a limited number of coins or fancy math.\nIt has to fix a problem, give people more freedom, and be something that lots of people want to use.\nGetting a grip on market sentiment is key because it’s the overall mood of investors, which can really shake up the prices of cryptocurrencies.\nSince the crypto market can be unpredictable, changes in how people feel can happen fast, affecting both how much is bought and sold and the price tag that comes with a crypto coin.\nHere’s my simple game plan for keeping up with what the market feels:\nPaying attention to what people think about the market is important, but it’s just as key to see how different cryptocurrencies are always trying to do better than each other.\nThis isn’t just about the big names with the most value; it’s also about all the new and smaller coins, each finding their own way.\nFor example, in the DeFi space, there’s a lot of competition. Projects are fighting to get more money and people using them.\nThey all have different things they’re good at, like helping you earn more on your investment, borrowing against your assets, or having a say in how things are run.\nThis variety means people who want to be in charge of their own money can pick and choose to fit their own comfort with risk and how they want to invest.\nNew coins keep popping up, creating a place where each one has to prove it’s really useful to stick around. This keeps them on their toes because if they don’t get better, they could disappear.\nWhen I’m checking out a new cryptocurrency or thinking about putting money into one, I make sure to look at two big things: tokenomics and how the digital money is handed out.\nThese details really matter for figuring out if a token will stick around and be worth something down the road.\nHere’s the lowdown:\nTokenomics and the way tokens are spread around are super important for any cryptocurrency. I’m always looking for systems that are steady and give people freedom. They’re what make people trust in the value and use of the tokens.\nWhen thinking about how digital currencies work and how they’re shared out, it’s important to also look at how rules and laws are changing and what that means for the future and safety of the crypto market.\nThe influence of rules on the money value in the crypto world is huge.\nGovernments all over are trying to figure out how to fit these digital coins into the money rules we already have.\nThe SEC and the CFTC in the US are working hard to set the rules for how these digital assets should be handled.\nEurope is rolling Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) in an attempt to regulate the industry. Poland and Turkey too.\nWhen the people in charge make the rules clear, it makes investors feel more secure, and more people might start using (thus buying) cryptocurrencies.\nThis kind of sureness can help the value of digital currencies because it lowers the worry about sudden, harsh rules that can hurt new ideas and stop people from joining the market.\nBut if the rules are too tough, they might kill the main idea of being free from control, and that could stop growth.\nFollowing the rules can cost crypto companies a lot, and it could make it harder for them to come up with new ideas.\nBig changes in rules can also make the market jump up and down a lot.\nPeople who know the market well have to keep an eye on what’s happening with the rules and find a balance between wanting freedom and being practical by following the new rules.\nThis back-and-forth between being controlled and being free keeps affecting how people see the value of cryptocurrencies.\nIn conclusion, cryptocurrency value is a multifaceted beast, shaped by supply-demand interplay, utility, market sentiment, competitive forces, tokenomics, and regulation.\nAs you can see there isn’t just one reason that drives the value in cryptocurrency up or down.\nUnderstanding them is key for planning your next move.\nREAD ALSO\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

This development aims at making the blockchain more efficient by enabling automatic adjustments to the size of blocks according to real-time transaction demands.\nThe core idea behind ABL is straightforward: allow the blockchain to adapt its block size limits dynamically based on how many transactions are occurring.\nIf there are more transactions, blocks can increase in size; if fewer, they can decrease.\nThis flexibility helps manage traffic effectively without manual intervention—a process that can be slow and susceptible to influence or errors.\nTraditionally, debates around block sizes have been intense within cryptocurrency communities.\nLarger blocks generally mean more transactions per second and lower fees but require more computational power and storage space from those participating in maintaining the network (known as miners).\nSmaller blocks tend toward higher fees and slower processing times but are easier for individual miners to handle.\nTechnically speaking, Bitcoin Cash’s ABL algorithm calculates changes using what’s called an exponentially weighted moving average—this looks at previous block sizes and adjusts future limits accordingly. There are two main components involved:\nThese mechanisms work together seamlessly under normal conditions while providing additional support during high-demand periods without compromising security or performance.\nThis innovative adjustment mechanism sets both minimum floor values for safety and responsive ceilings for growth potential within predetermined parameters ensuring stability even with fluctuating usage levels.\nAs cryptocurrencies continue evolving towards broader adoption globally, solutions like Bitcoin Cash’s ABL algorithm represent significant steps forward in addressing fundamental challenges such as scalability—an essential factor for any technology aspiring widespread use across various industries worldwide.\nEnthusiasts believe these improvements might finally resolve longstanding scaling issues that have plagued similar technologies since their inception.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

There have been plenty of success stories floating around and this has drawn in millions of people into the world of online trading.\nBut, you have to bear in mind that while you can make fortunes, there is also a possibility of devastating losses if you make the wrong decisions. One of the important wrong decisions to avoid is related to the broker you sign up with.\nThe right one can lead you to success, while the wrong one is the road to disaster. This TradeSafer review talks about a platform that falls in the first category.\nI had experimented with several brokers when I first started trading and had found myself back at square one because most failed at living up to the claims they had made.\nThe TradeSafer broker was like a breath of fresh air because it had everything that I could have possibly asked for. You can find out more details here.\nI will start this review with the security features on the TradeSafer trading platform because it is the first thing I checked when I came across it. As there has been a surge in cyberattacks, I was worried about the safety of my sensitive information and my financial details.\nI did not want hackers to steal and misuse it, which had happened on plenty of other platforms. Hence, security was a big priority for me, as it is for anyone else who decides to put their trust in any online trading platform.\nThe good news is that the Trade Safer broker has not taken this responsibility lightly. It understands just how vital it is to keep the data they are entrusted with and the funds safe. It accomplishes this task through the use of SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption that keeps the data safe from prying eyes.\nThe segregation of funds ensures they are not misappropriated. The platform also uses 2-FA (two-factor authentication) for adding another layer of security and the website is also protected through firewalls.\nThe key to trading success is not making profitable trades all the time; even the most professional and expert traders cannot earn profits in every trade. Instead, it is about minimizing your risks and keeping your losses as low as possible and diversification is the strategy that can help you in doing so.\nUnfortunately, it is not that simple to manage because most platforms have very limited assets available that can make it difficult to expand your portfolio. Luckily, the tradesafer.com trading platform proves to be different because it offers you a horde of assets belonging to different markets.\nThe fact that they can be traded via a single trading account is undoubtedly convenient for every trader. There are different types of assets to choose from, whether forex currencies, stocks, indices, commodities, or cryptocurrencies.\nYou can decide to add as many or as little assets as possible for creating a balanced portfolio. This ensures that you are able to reduce your risks and increase your chances of profits as well.\nThe knowledge you have about the financial markets and the ins and outs of trading can make all the difference in your level of trading success.\nWhile luck definitely plays a role in your journey, your knowledge and skill are what is most important. Thus, if you wish to make the right calculations and trades, you need to have an understanding of the markets and the trading dynamics.\nThe TradeSafer trading platform provides you access to in-depth learning resources that can help you accumulate the said knowledge and skills.\nThey have created an entire library of learning resources that you can use for polishing your knowledge about the trading market. There are guides, e-books, tutorials and videos that cover different aspects of trading.\nThe tradesafer.com broker also conducts regular seminars and webinars where traders can learn about the important trends and strategies in the financial markets.\nThis enables every trader to gain an in-depth understanding about how the financial markets and trading works, thereby improving their chances of making successful trades.\nWith the high number of scams happening in the online trading space left and right, it is understood that you will also be worried about TradeSafer scam.\nTo ease any doubts, I went to great lengths to check out the broker’s offerings and studied its policies to see if there were any loopholes. I did not find anything that would send up a red flag, as it proved to be capable and professional in every way.\nThanks to this TradeSafer review, every trader will be able to see that it is the best choice for unlocking the secrets to trading success. And a little bit offtopic (well not really) – I really enjoyed this blog on trading and cryptocurrencies.

He invested in the $DNODE project with unfixed liquidity, did not sell when the price fell, but ended up with a profit, having sold coins before the dump.\nHe also talked about the second successful deal with $JIM coin, where he followed a large investor and made money on the meme token despite the huge risk.\nFor further details on this and other case studies, readers are encouraged to explore the blog section on the ArbitrageScanner website.\nThe user tracked the wallet, analyzed it and as soon as the wallet went to 10% plus, the owner sold both coins and the client did the same. The main goal of the customer was to make money, which he did with the help of the wallet analysis tools.\nWallet analysis helps a lot in finding those coins that will shoot up by dozens of profit, but before you go into them you need to look carefully: contract security like with $DNODE and watch for tokens on social networks, as it happened with $JIM, where he is under-earned.\nArbitrageScanner has also added collections and the ability to track all transactions of the wallets you have selected.

For example, Kane Warwick, CEO of Synthetix, joined the list of successful crypto traders with a monthly profit of $11.5 million, equaling a 78.1% increase.\nYou can see this wallet here: https://wallet.arbitragescanner.io/0x9c5083dd4838e120dbeac44c052179692aa5dac5?ref=9Q0750G6H3\nIf you’re a beginner and don’t know much about arbitrage, the ArbitrageScanner team will help you take your first steps in blockchain analysis and cryptocurrency arbitrage.

You can start with as little as","title":"How Much Money Do You Need To Start In Crypto?","content":" TL;DR -If you are wondering How Much Money Do You Need To Start In Crypto, note that is less than you are probably thinking. You can start with as little as $5. No, I am not kidding. You can pick a cryptocurrency, sign up to a trusted crypto exchange like Binance, set an automatic, recurring purchase every day, week or month – depending on your needs and you are done.\nThis article will provide insights into determining how much money you should invest based on various factors such as your income, expenses, savings, and investment goals. Additionally, we’ll explore different investment strategies for beginners and tips for monitoring your investments effectively.\nAs a novice in the world of cryptocurrency, I was always curious about how much money one needs to start investing in this market. The abundance of information on the internet can be overwhelming, and it’s easy to get lost in all the jargon and technical terms.\nAfter conducting extensive research and speaking with experts in the field, I have compiled a guide that will help you determine how much money you need to start your cryptocurrency investment journey.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies can be incredibly lucrative, but it’s important to understand that there are risks involved. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets that can fluctuate significantly within seconds or minutes. Therefore, before deciding on an investment strategy, it’s essential to assess your financial situation carefully.\nYou’ll want to be careful before jumping into cryptocurrency, as it’s like diving into a pool without knowing the depth or temperature – there are risks you need to understand.\nOne of the most significant risks is crypto market volatility, which refers to the unpredictable and rapid fluctuations in prices. Since cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic value and are not backed by any government, their prices can be influenced by speculation and hype.\nAnother factor that contributes to the volatility of cryptocurrencies is regulatory challenges. Governments around the world have yet to come up with a unified approach when it comes to regulating cryptocurrencies, which has led to a hodgepodge of regulations that vary from country to country. This uncertainty can lead to sudden price drops or even legal issues for investors who may unknowingly violate laws.\nThe technology behind cryptocurrency is still relatively new and constantly evolving, meaning that there will always be some level of risk involved. It’s crucial that you do your research before investing in cryptocurrency and only put in what you can afford to lose.\nBy understanding these risks, you’ll be better equipped to make informed decisions about whether or not investing in cryptocurrency is right for you.\nAssessing your financial readiness is key to embarking on a successful crypto investment journey. Before investing in cryptocurrency, it’s important to evaluate your budget planning and risk tolerance levels. This will help you determine how much money you can afford to invest without putting yourself in financial jeopardy.\nBudget planning involves analyzing your income and expenses to identify areas where you can cut back or save more. It’s important to have a clear understanding of your monthly cash flow before investing in cryptocurrency. If you’re struggling to make ends meet, it may not be the best time to invest. A rule of thumb is only investing what you can afford to lose.\nRisk tolerance levels vary from person to person and depend on various factors such as age, income level, and investment experience. Generally speaking, younger investors with higher incomes tend to have a higher risk tolerance level compared to older investors with lower incomes.\nIt’s important to assess your own risk tolerance level before investing in cryptocurrency because it can impact the amount of money you’re willing to invest and the potential returns you can expect.\nIn conclusion, assessing your financial situation is crucial when considering investing in cryptocurrency. This helps provide clarity about how much money you should allocate towards this type of investment and whether you are prepared for any potential losses that could arise from doing so.\nWhen selecting a cryptocurrency exchange, it’s important to consider factors such as security, user interface, and transaction fees.\nBy taking all these things into account, you’ll be able to choose an exchange that meets your needs while also keeping costs low.\nOne of the best ways for new investors to approach cryptocurrency is by starting with small investments and gradually increasing their position over time.\nInvesting in cryptocurrency can be volatile, so it’s important to mitigate risk through diversification techniques.\nThis means spreading out your investments across different cryptocurrencies, rather than putting all your funds into one.\nAnother effective strategy for new investors entering the world of cryptocurrency is to employ a technique known as dollar cost averaging. This approach involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the current price or market conditions.\nDollar cost averaging offers several advantages, particularly when dealing with the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. By investing a fixed amount at predetermined intervals, you reduce the impact of short-term price fluctuations on your overall investment. Instead of trying to time the market and make large investments all at once, you spread out your purchases over time.\nThis strategy helps to mitigate the risk associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. Since prices can experience significant fluctuations, it can be challenging to accurately predict the optimal entry point. Dollar cost averaging allows you to bypass the need for precise timing and eliminates the stress of trying to make accurate predictions about short-term price movements.\nBy consistently investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, you benefit from a concept known as “pound-cost averaging.” This approach ensures that you buy more cryptocurrency when prices are low and less when prices are high. Over time, this can result in a lower average cost per unit of cryptocurrency, potentially enhancing your overall returns.\nMoreover, dollar cost averaging promotes discipline and removes the emotional factor from investing. It helps investors avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations or succumbing to the fear of missing out on potential gains. Instead, you establish a systematic approach that encourages consistency and aligns with a long-term investment perspective.\nTo do dollar cost averaging using Binance, follow these steps:\nWhen choosing which cryptocurrencies to invest in, it’s important to consider both long-term and short-term gains.\nShort-term gains involve buying low and selling high in a shorter period of time, while long-term gains involve holding onto an investment for a longer period of time with the expectation that its value will increase significantly over time.\nIt’s important to have a mix of both strategies in your portfolio. Here’s an article I wrote a couple of weeks ago suggesting, in my opinion, some cryptocurrencies worth investing.\nAnother factor to consider when investing in cryptocurrency is the overall market trends. While some cryptocurrencies may experience sudden spikes or drops in price due to individual events or news, there are often broader movements across the entire market.\nBy monitoring these trends and adjusting your investment strategy accordingly, you can improve your chances of success as a beginner investor in cryptocurrency.\nTo effectively monitor your cryptocurrency investments, you must set clear goals and regularly conduct research and analysis.\nSetting goals is essential because it helps you stay focused on achieving a specific outcome. For instance, if you want to earn a certain amount of profit within a specific period, setting this goal will inform the investment decisions you make.\nResearch and analysis are equally important in monitoring your crypto investments. Keep track of market trends by following relevant news outlets, social media accounts of influencers in the industry, or using analytical tools that provide real-time information on price fluctuations. Analyzing historical data can also help predict future trends.\nLastly, be prepared to make timely decisions that could impact your financial future.\nThis means having a plan in place for when market conditions change unexpectedly. Staying informed about the latest developments in the crypto world will enable you to react quickly and make informed decisions about buying or selling assets.\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your investments are monitored effectively and meet your desired outcomes over time.\nI highly suggest to get a book from this collection – if you are serious on cryptocurrency investing: Top 10 BEST Crypto Trading Books for New Traders.\nIn conclusion, investing in cryptocurrency can be a risky but potentially lucrative venture. It’s important to thoroughly assess your financial situation and understand the risks before diving in. Choosing a reputable cryptocurrency exchange is crucial for the safety of your investments.\nAs a beginner, it’s recommended to start with small investments and gradually increase as you become more familiar with the market. Monitoring your investments regularly will help you make informed decisions based on market trends and news updates.\nRemember, patience and persistence are key when it comes to crypto investing. Overall, while there’s no set amount of money needed to start investing in cryptocurrency, it’s important to approach it strategically and cautiously.\nWith careful planning and research, you can potentially reap the rewards of this exciting new asset class.\nREAD ALSO\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

To cap it all off, on Sunday, the final day, a semi-official gala was organized as well, where the Golden Rabbit Awards were given for the best films nominated in four categories. The winners were announced as follows: DIRTY COIN for Best Movie, SEARCHING FOR SATOSH for Best Story, HODL for Best Short, and MY TRUST IN YOU IS BROKEN for the Audience Choice award.\nBesides the film screenings, the iconic rooms of the Warsaw’s palace also hosted dynamic sessions led by selected participants on the Community Stage, along with a special segment for younger guests, focused on cartoons and an open stage co-run by children and teenagers.\nIn addition to these points, attendees also took part in several games, from paper and scissors to a Chain Duel tournament on a large cinematic screen, organized as a part of the Halving Party to introduce new traditions related to Bitcoin’s cyclical nature.\nWhat’s uncommon in buildings like PKiN was the DIRTY COIN pre-premiere cocktail party, which due to the Bitcoin halving happening just a few hours later, transformed into a grand celebration in the palace interiors, accompanied by the aforementioned laser show outside the building.\nThe extensive program of both BFF24 and the European Halving Party didn’t solely center around the Palace of Culture and Science.\nSeveral satellite meetups, networking gatherings and leisure activities extended across various nearby locations, offering all guests a comprehensive taste of Warsaw and its attractions. From retro-bus tours around the city to authentic Polish cuisine at the charming Prodiż Warszawski restaurant, and even cruising down the Vistula River — there was something for everyone.\nAdditionally, for those seeking an extra thrill, side activities such as a shooting range and laser paintball were also an option to take part in.\nSaturday, already signaling a new era in the Bitcoin cycle, as it surpassed block number 840,000, offered another entertaining opportunity in the evening.\nWhile not held in Kinoteka, the festivities continued within the iconic walls of the Palace of Culture and Science, particularly at the bar-café Kulturalna, where on April 20th, a large open party took place as part of the overall event program.\nOther unique points of the program as part of BFf24 and the European Halving Party include:\nIn the official communication conducted by the Bitcoin FilmFest project, whether on the halving website (which contained the entire program of both events) or on the project’s main social media channel, X (formerly Twitter), there were frequent mentions that BFF and the European Halving Party are not “just another conference, but a cultural experience driven by the community.”\nConsidering all the points mentioned in this read, it’s hard not to agree with that statement — it wasn’t just a conference, not even just an event, but a 100% experience, built by and for people.\nAn innovative approach to education and conscious Bitcoin adoption through art, culture and cinema.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

We’re holding the federal government accountable and fighting for clear, consistent regulation of digital assets in Texas: https://t.co/IFKowMoc2w\nAt the heart of this legal confrontation is a broader industry frustration with the SEC’s approach to digital asset transactions.\nMany in the sector argue that the SEC’s reliance on ad hoc enforcement actions, rather than establishing clear regulations, creates a cloud of uncertainty that hampers business operations and innovation.\nThe plaintiffs are seeking a judicial declaration to bring clarity to the industry, arguing that digital asset transactions should not be classified as securities based on the broad interpretation of investment contracts.\nThe SEC’s current regulatory stance has cast a shadow over companies operating in the digital asset space, with LEJILEX among those feeling the crunch.\nThe industry is calling for the SEC to reevaluate its enforcement strategy and work collaboratively with sector leaders.\nSuch a partnership could pave the way for a regulatory framework that supports compliance with American laws while also fostering the growth of future technologies.\nThe Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas, a nonprofit trade association, stands at the forefront of advocating for sensible digital asset policies in the state.\nWith a membership comprising leading innovators in the digital asset space, the Alliance champions the potential of blockchain technology as a cornerstone of the internet’s future.\nSimilarly, LEJILEX, a Texas-based company, is making strides with its non-custodial trading platform, Legit.Exchange, aiming to provide a secure and cutting-edge trading experience. Both organizations share a vision for Texas as a leader in digital asset policy and innovation.\nThe legal challenge mounted by LEJILEX and the Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas against the SEC is more than a dispute over regulatory jurisdiction; it is a stand for the freedom to innovate and operate within a clear, predictable legal framework.\nAs the digital asset industry continues to mature, the need for regulatory clarity and collaboration has never been more apparent.\nThis lawsuit represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing dialogue between regulators and the digital asset community, with the potential to shape the future of digital asset innovation and regulation.\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

But crypto is much more than Bitcoin. Investors get bigger gains plus cross-border liquidity when they hold crypto directly instead of just having exposure through an ETF.\nSheridan, Wyoming, March 21, 2024, Solo Investing in cryptocurrencies is not suitable for beginners.\nThe world of cryptocurrencies has undergone significant changes since the emergence of Bitcoin more than ten years ago.\nIt is a rapidly evolving investment platform.

These moves come as part of broader efforts to protect the national currency from further decline.\nDr. Emomotimi Agama, Director General of Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced during a virtual meeting that new rules are being formulated to curb P2P cryptocurrency transactions.\nThis announcement has sparked widespread discussion among financial experts and crypto traders who doubt the feasibility of such bans due to the decentralized nature of these transactions.\nFollowing initial steps taken by President Bola Tinubu’s administration in February, which included detaining employees from major crypto exchange Binance, there was a temporary improvement in the value of the naira.\nHowever, this recovery was short-lived as recent reports indicate another significant drop in its value against the dollar despite previous interventions like interest rate hikes and treasury bill sales.\nMany financial experts argue that enforcing a complete ban on P2P cryptocurrency transactions is nearly impossible given their decentralized structure.\nThey suggest focusing on more effective economic strategies rather than attempting to control an inherently uncontrollable market segment.\nFor instance, Kalu Aja pointed out that personal trades between individuals are difficult for any government body to monitor or regulate effectively.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has weighed into this issue by recommending that Nigeria should consider licensing international cryptocurrency platforms as part of its economic reforms. By doing so, it could better integrate cryptocurrencies into its financial system while ensuring proper regulatory oversight through anti-money laundering frameworks.\nAs discussions continue about how best to manage these challenges facing Nigeria’s economy concerning digital assets and currency stability, it remains clear that simple bans may not be sufficient or practical solutions moving forward.\nFollow BITNEWSBOT on Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, and Google News for instant updates >\nLATEST POSTS\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

Through some","title":"Tokenizing the Future of Real Estate: An Interview with Julia Filobokova, CEO of Sabai Protocol","content":" Exploring the vision, utility token, and innovative ecosystem behind the blockchain platform democratizing real estate investing.\nA week or so ago, I came across Sabai Protocol – a blockchain platform for tokenizing real estate and other physical assets, which intrigued me. Through some connections, I managed to score an exclusive interview with Julia Filobokova, the CEO of Sabai Protocol.\nJulia has over 12 years of experience in real estate and her team created Sabai Protocol out of a desire to bring more accessibility, efficiency and transparency to real estate investing through blockchain technology.\nIn our discussion, she shed light on the company’s origins, their innovative product ecosystem powered by the $SABAI utility token, and their ambitious vision for the future of tokenized real estate and assets.\nWhat follows is the full transcript of my interview with Julia Filobokova, where she provides insights into Sabai Protocol’s unique offerings, the tangible benefits for investors, and the key milestones they hope to achieve in revolutionizing this industry over the next 5 years.\nSabai’s team has over 12 years of working in and with real estate making the company’s leadership team experts in the market.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we were seeking new resort real estate opportunities to add to our tokenization project.\nDisappointed by existing protocols, we took the risk to create our own. Almost four years later we scaled into different areas as well providing products like tokenized private equity, funds, debt and its own academy created for those willing to step into the world of blockchain, crypto and tokenized real estate.\nFor individual token holders, the primary interest lies in the potential growth of the token price as the platform expands and new business clients come on board.\nFurthermore, token holders do get a lot of benefits from staking including in real estate pools, which will be launched soon.\nWe also recently launched a fully operational sales department. That means the imminent signing of contracts by new business clients, resulting in the purchase of tokens in large quantities, and consequently, an increase in token prices.\nIn our business model, B2B clients must purchase tokens to tokenize their assets.\nFor example, a real estate developer seeking to tokenize a seaside project would pay for the tokenization protocol and buy utility tokens for consulting on Sabai Academy.\nThese tokens are continuously spent on staff training, resulting in their burning. Moreover, ongoing training for their staff, including sales managers and marketers, will necessitate the continual expenditure of tokens, leading to their burning.\nAs Sabai Property is fully digital, customers can purchase part or a full property with just a few clicks saving their time and money on in-person meetings, flights and all the paperwork.\nOn average our customers save four weeks, by filling out all the necessary information within 15 minutes.\nOne of Sabai’s key strategic partners is Villa Carte – one of the leading property service providers in Phuket which essentially provides real estate assets for tokenization through Sabai’s platform.\nWe are also in conversation with other large and small real estate companies and will announce new partnerships quite soon.\nSabai Ecoverse encompasses our entire product ecosystem, with Sabai Property serving as our investment platform built upon our tokenization protocol.\nThe strength lies in the seamless integration and mutual reinforcement of these products. The key advantage of our investment platform is its superior profitability compared to all other “safe investment options”.\nIn simpler terms, Sabai Property offers the highest profitability, second only to cryptocurrency, while maintaining the lowest volatility.\nSabai ID serves as both a personal user account and a manager’s admin cabinet.\nFor users, Sabai ID provides effortless access to all ecosystem products, a user-friendly dashboard for asset tracking, and investment tools for tokenized real estate.\nManagers, on the other hand, benefit from a constructor to issue RWA\\VA and a comprehensive dashboard to oversee the entire system from one interface.\nSabai ID undergoes continuous updates, with new features regularly introduced.\nToken holders are eligible to receive profits, while all other matters are managed by the platform’s management and associated companies.\nThis setup enables investors to enjoy a passive income without delving into the intricacies of real estate management.\nI concur with those who argue that the “metaverse” is overhyped. In fact, I might go as far as to say it’s a dead-end technology branch.\nSabai has no affiliation with the “metaverse”. The similarity in names can sometimes cause confusion.\nHence, we’ve opted to refresh our branding and will be using the name Sabai Protocol moving forward.\nMost of our focus is on our main product, Sabai Protocol. Our immediate goals include signing new clients and reaching a $10 million milestone in tokenized asset value by summer’s end.\nToday, we’re in talks with a Georgian developer keen on tokenizing part of their resort\nWe’re also gearing up for a big marketing push to promote our utility token, featuring a fresh design and new exchange listings.\nAdditionally, we’re also working on a major announcement targeted at the Thailand-based realtor community to accelerate partnerships and sell tokenized assets.\nThailand’s growing real estate market is driving the adoption of tokenization among key players like developers.\nWhile competitors offer solely white paper and landing pages, we’ve developed a demo product and a platform for RWA tokenization.\nThe demo version of the Sabai World mobile game will be tokenized next quarter, allowing us to secure contracts with clients.\nOur five-year plan focuses on leveraging our strengths: the Sabai protocol, the RWA & VA assets tokenization platform, and our suite of services. This involves attracting new clients, tokenizing more assets, and exploring new sectors.\nWith a new marketing director, we’re planning to forge partnerships in finance, real estate, technology, and regulatory sectors.\nOur marketing team is expanding efforts to broaden our audience. Additionally, we aim to list new top exchanges, with Binance being our ultimate goal.\nABOUT JULIA\nJulia Filobokova is the CEO at Sabai Protocol. With a diverse background spanning finance and technology, she brings a blend of strategic insight and operational expertise to her role. Prior to joining Sabai, Julia had been COO at OMNIC, an international R&D company that develops automation and self-service solutions for logistics, e-commerce, retail, and HoReCa.\nCHECK ALSO\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

Customers on YouHodler can use their crypto as collateral on short-term loans.\nYou can even use the funds borrowed to carry out more trading on the platform. There are some advanced trading tools on the platform and it also has a strict anti-money laundering process.\nThe interest rate here is pretty decent.

You can have access to loans with your Bitcoin from Ledn.io. One of my problems with the platform is the lack of other cryptocurrencies on the platform.\nUsers can earn as high as 12.25% APY when they save their idle digital assets on the platform. You can also collect bitcoin-backed loans as well as B2X loans.\nThe platform is transparent in its dealings and it is also efficient and accountable. They have a mobile app that was released in January 2021 but it’s not as easy to use. the company needs to do some work on the app to make the user experience better.\nPROS\nCONS\nVauld is another platform that lets you earn interest on your Bitcoin and other digital currencies as soon as you deposit your funds on their platform. The interests are calculated daily and you are paid the interest every week.

This is a typical example of an instance where HODLers can borrow money using their cryptocurrency as collateral.\nThey have their SALT token and they can be used by members to pay for memberships and other perks on the SALT platform.\nInterest rates for crypto-backed loans on SALT start from 5.95% interest, but there is no pre-determined set rate for loans on the platform.\nThey accept several Stablecoins and altcoins like Doge, BTC, Ether, Litecoin, and Ripple.\nPROS\nCONS\nSmart Credit was founded in 2019 and it offers a different service when compared to all the platforms on this list. It is a peer-to-peer lending platform that allows for direct interactions between P2P customers.\nThere are no charges or intermediaries unlike what we have with other conventional crypto borrowing platforms.\nBorrowers normally submit their loan requests on the platform and lenders place their loan offers the matching algorithm will then match loan supply with loan demand. Once a match is identified, the lender can supply ETH and the borrower can borrow ETH.\nAll loans on the platform are insured for face value. The main aim of the platform is to provide the key components of the alternate blockchain-based financial system. the crypto lending/borrowing, the fixed-income funds, and integrations.\nPROS\nCONS\nA cryptocurrency-backed loan is a collateralized loan that you can get from a crypto lending platform or crypto exchange. The loans work in the same way a mortgage or a car loan works in the sense that you are using an asset. In this aspect, you will be using your cryptocurrency as collateral to secure the loan.\nYou can also decide to borrow your Cryptocurrency to a crypto lending platform and you will be able to earn interest on your digital assets when the crypto loan platform lends them to institutional borrowers.\nLet’s say you have a lot of cash stashed in your savings account and your bank pays you 0% interest in exchange for using it to issue loans to other customers. You must be absolutely crazy to\nThere is no business without risk and crypto lending has its fair share of risks. If you want to make a profit from your capital then you always have to accept the risk that comes with it.\nThe higher your potential profit the higher the risk involved. Cryptocurrency is a good example of this business mechanism.\nYou can be able to amass exorbitant profits but as a crypto investor, you still need to live with the high volatility.\nCrypto lending is not risk-free and in the normal sense, it shouldn’t be. You want to make profits from your crypto savings and there should be some risk involved certainly.\nHowever, before deciding to be a crypto lender or borrower you need to understand the risks you are about to take and the expected returns justify the risk you will take.\nYou can minimize the risk by making sure you invest with a renowned crypto lending service provider – like NEXO for example. It is also good to consider investing only in stable coins and also receive interest in stable coins.\nIt is actually up to you to adopt whatever strategy you want to use, but if you want to get higher profits you have to take additional risks. It is always wise to use stable coins when it comes to crypto lending because we all know that volatility is prevalent in the crypto world.\nDeposits in Interest accounts are not insured – this is one of the biggest risks when it comes to crypto lending. The assets in your crypto interest account are not insured like money in a traditional bank account. if the exchange fails or has any technical problem you can lose everything.\nCounterparty risk – this is another serious issue when it comes to crypto lending. Crypto lending platforms receive crypto from savers and borrowers.\nThe service providers normally regulate what they can do with the crypto they receive. In the clause you will have to agree that they might lend, sell, pledge, hypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or even dispose of an asset and eligible digital assets to the counterparty. The platforms will use your crypto assets whether you are a saver or borrower and make money from them.\nThey lend them to crypto exchanges, hedge funds, and other institutional investors. The risk here is that it creates a counterparty risk because if the counterparty to these trades fails to return the cryptocurrencies, your lending platform provider may become insolvent.\nRepayment terms are different – depending on the crypto lending platform you might have less than a year to repay what you borrowed. It is important to know the length of repayment even before you collect the loan.\nIn some cases, you can create your repayment schedule but it is usually short-term repayment plans. Each crypto lender has its terms and conditions, unlike traditional money institutions where everything is almost similar.\nNo access to your digital assets – as long as you have an outstanding balance to your loan, you can’t have access to your holdings to transact or trade. It can be an issue if there is volatility and the price of the crypto drops or appreciates or maybe you need cash in a hurry.\nYou must be absolutely crazy not to take advantage of this Decentralized Finance revolution. Ditch the banks. Convert your fiat money to stablecoins or cryptocurrency and add them to any of the above platforms (except Salt Lending) to start earning compounding interest on your Crypto of up to 12.73%.\nIf you want to help more people, friends, or relatives to start building their wealth I suggest sharing our best cryptocurrency lending platforms article with as many of them as you can.

It's crucial for individuals interested in purchasing, selling or trading","title":"Custodial Exchanges Explained: Why You Should Embrace Them","content":" Secure Transactions, Ease of Use\nCryptocurrency heavily relies on exchanges to help users conduct transactions. It’s crucial for individuals interested in purchasing, selling or trading assets to grasp the concept of exchanges and their role in ensuring security.\nIn this detailed guide we will examine how these custodial exchanges work, including their roles, safety protocols and the benefits they provide to cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\nTable of Contents\nCustodial cryptocurrency exchanges, known as centralized platforms enable individuals to participate in asset transactions by offering a variety of options for buying, selling and trading.\nIn contrast to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that operate on networks without authority, custodial crypto exchanges are overseen by companies or organizations.\nThese entities serve as intermediaries presenting users with a user interface to engage with the cryptocurrency market.\nUsers benefit from the convenience of management-streamlined transactions and access to a selection of cryptocurrencies when they entrust their funds to these exchanges.\nAt the heart of custodial exchanges lies the concept of custody. Where users’ assets are securely stored by the exchange on their behalf, this involves the exchange holding both the cryptocurrencies and private keys needed to access and manage those assets.\nWhile this centralized approach provides ease of use and convenience it also comes with risks such as vulnerabilities to hacking or mismanagement by the custodial entity.\nNevertheless centralized exchanges offer an entry point into cryptocurrencies by providing a user-friendly platform for buying, selling and trading digital assets.\nCustodial exchanges make cryptocurrency transactions easier for users around the globe providing convenience and accessibility. Knowing how centralized exchanges operate is crucial for anyone to confidently and securely navigate the evolving world of cryptocurrency trading.\nTo start using an exchange users must first sign up for an account. When signing up they will need to input details and possibly go through identity verification steps to adhere to regulations.\nAfter setting up their account users will be guided to transfer funds to their exchange wallet. This step typically involves using payment options like bank transfers, credit or debit cards or cryptocurrency deposits.\nWhen users deposit funds into their exchange wallet they are essentially handing over ownership of those assets to the exchange.\nThe exchange then takes on the responsibility of holding and managing these funds for the user. This custody agreement usually includes storing the cryptocurrencies and their private keys in wallets controlled by the exchange.\nUsers can securely access their funds held in custody to carry out transactions on the exchange platform. These transactions may involve purchasing, selling or trading cryptocurrencies.\nWhen users opt to proceed with a transaction they provide their instructions via the exchange interface indicating the type and quantity of cryptocurrency they wish to engage with.\nWhen a user sends a request for a transaction the exchange where they keep their funds takes care of it. They check if there are funds, confirm the transaction details and make the trade based on the market situation.\nThe exchange can also help users on its platform to trade with each other smoothly by connecting them.\nUsers are given tools and options through exchanges to handle their accounts and keep track of their transactions.\nThis involves checking transaction records, seeing account balances, customizing trading settings and setting up security measures like two-factor authentication (2FA) for added account security.\nUsers can choose to withdraw their funds from the exchange whenever they want. If users want to transfer their currencies out of the exchange wallet they can make a withdrawal request.\nThe exchange will then handle the withdrawal by subtracting the requested amount from the user’s balance and sending the cryptocurrencies to the specified external wallet address.\nWhile some have raised concerns about exchanges consolidating control over users’ funds these platforms provide a range of advantages that meet the varied requirements of cryptocurrency traders.\nCustodial exchanges benefit from their user interface which simplifies the buying, selling and trading of cryptocurrencies.\nThese platforms are made for both newcomers and seasoned traders and have navigation, clear guidance and user-friendly features.\nWith a user experience centralized exchanges enable traders to participate confidently in the cryptocurrency market no matter their skill level.\nCentralized exchanges are commonly known for their liquidity compared to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) which facilitate more competitive trade executions for users.\nThe enhanced liquidity on platforms results in bid-ask spreads and lower slippage allowing traders to open and close positions with minimal disruption to market prices.\nThis advantage in liquidity makes centralized exchanges especially appealing to traders seeking transactions and smooth market entry.\nTrustworthy custodial exchanges place a value on assisting customers in addressing any questions, concerns or technical issues they may face.\nFrom guiding users through the platform to resolving account problems and helping with trading difficulties these exchanges offer avenues for support such as chat, email assistance and detailed FAQs.\nBy prioritizing customer service the exchanges aim to improve user satisfaction and create a trading environment that builds confidence among users on the platform.\nNumerous custodial exchanges extend beyond trading functions. Provide advanced options to accommodate intricate trading tactics.\nThese enhancements might encompass margin trading enabling users to enhance their trading positions by borrowing funds from the exchange along with stop-loss orders and chart analysis tools for managing risks and conducting analyses.\nBy granting access to trading tools and features custodial cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to implement trading strategies successfully, seize market prospects and enhance their trading outcomes.\nPlasBit price charts provide users with an array of information such as price fluctuations over time frames like 24 hours, weekly, monthly and yearly.\nAdditionally they display the 24-hour trading volume, market capitalization and the number of tokens in circulation.\nThese details offer perspectives for studying market trends and are accompanied by a user-friendly price calculator located next to the charts.\nCustodial exchanges frequently focus on ensuring security and employ measures to protect users’ funds and personal details.\nThese security protocols could involve using multi-factor authentication (MFA), encrypting sensitive information, conducting routine security checks and offering insurance for potential losses resulting from security breaches.\nBy placing a value on security custodial crypto exchanges offer users assurance and trust in the protection of their assets alleviating worries about risks linked to cryptocurrency trading.\nSeveral custodial platforms provide access to an array of cryptocurrencies beyond the known choices such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nTraders can look into assets including alternative coins and tokens to broaden their investment portfolios and seize potential opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.\nThis broad access to a range of cryptocurrencies enables users to experiment with investment approaches, leverage market trends and engage with expanding digital assets.\nEnsuring security is important in exchanges that safeguard users’ funds from theft, hacking, and unauthorized access.\nCentralized exchanges employ methods to uphold security standards aiming to protect user assets and preserve the reliability of their platforms.\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) plays a role in ensuring the security of exchanges. Most platforms mandate users to activate MFA which enhances security by requiring verification steps before entering a password.\nPopular methods include receiving a code via SMS or email and using authentication apps such as Google Authenticator or Authy.\nImplementing factors for authentication custodial exchanges lowers the chances of entry into user accounts.\nTo reduce the chances of hacking and unauthorized entry many custodial cryptocurrency exchanges use cold storage methods to store a large portion of users’ funds.\nCold storage entails keeping cryptocurrencies offline in hardware wallets or physical vaults that are not linked to the internet.\nBy separating assets from risks these exchanges can protect them from cyber attacks and unauthorized access attempts.\nCustodial transactions make use of encryption methods to safeguard details and transaction data against interception and unauthorized entry.\nEncryption guarantees that confidential information stays unreadable to those lacking the decryption key thereby preserving user privacy and confidentiality.\nThrough encrypting data both when stored and during transfer custodial cryptocurrency exchanges enhance the security of their systems that shielding against possible data breaches.\nCustodial exchanges regularly carry out security audits and evaluations to detect and fix any weaknesses in their systems.\nThese assessments are usually conducted by cybersecurity firms to guarantee fairness and thoroughness in the assessment process.\nBy pinpointing and addressing security vulnerabilities custodial cryptocurrency exchanges can strengthen the robustness of their platforms and uphold user confidence.\nSome custodial platforms provide insurance protection to offer a level of security and assurance for users.\nIf there is a breach in security or unauthorized transactions leading to fund loss this insurance can compensate affected users for their losses within limits.\nThrough this insurance offering these platforms show their dedication to protecting user funds and reducing the uncertainties linked to trading cryptocurrencies.\nIn cryptocurrency exchanges there are platforms that shine due to their trustworthiness, safety measures and user-friendly interfaces.

We're analyzing what cryptocurrencies are and how they can bring you money.","title":"How to make money investing in cryptocurrencies","content":" How safe and profitable is an investment in cryptocurrencies? We’re analyzing what cryptocurrencies are and how they can bring you money.\nCryptocurrencies have been in our lives for at least 12 years, and it has recently become known that Facebook will also enter the dance, launching its own cryptocurrency, called ‘Libra’. But why are cryptocurrencies so popular? How can you buy them? Is it in your best interest to enter the market or the cryptocurrency exchange? In this article, we will answer all these questions.\nWe start blasphemously, by paragraphing out the concept of Theogony, to give the definition of cryptocurrency: this is a word first recorded in 1998 by Wei Dai in the correspondence list of the Internet collective of cypherpunks, supporting the idea of a new form of money based on a distributed database (Blockchain), in open software, which users have the ability to modify (forking).\nThis new kind of money is not based on a central institution but obeys the norms of Peer-to-Peer transactions. Ten years later, Satoshi Nakamoto will publish in the same mailing list the first specifications of bitcoin in the now famous white paper that was soon filed in public.\nThe current exchange rate of bitcoin on the European money market is around 18.000 USD.\nHere’s what you need to start with making money with cryptocurencies\nIt is an intangible currency, the value of which is linked to the common trust between investors, its integration into the financial markets and the public interest in its use. Each cryptocurrency presents its own specificities in terms of digital analysis. Each transaction, however, occurs as follows:\nWhen the consumer makes any purchase online, the banks validate the transaction. In the case of Bitcoin, however, transactions occur without any third-party intervention, through a system called hashing. When a person pays another person with bitcoin, the Blockchain computers of each cryptocurrency check the validity of the transaction based on solving a related mathematical problem. If the result of the problem is valid, then the transaction unfolds normally and is registered in the cryptocurrency database.\nAll transactions of each cryptocurrency are available and transparent to anyone who wishes to keep a record, and it is worth stressing that there is no element of returnability and/or cancellation of transactions. Any transfer to and from Bitcoin is considered completely secure and it is extremely difficult to make losses or thefts.\nHere there is a significant difference between the two concepts:\nInvesting concerns those who want to exploit some profits in the long term through currency purchases, investing mainly in currencies that do not show serious fluctuations in their value.\nTrading is the exact opposite: it mainly concerns small investors who start with small amounts, who aim to profit, buying, and selling currencies according to their rises and falls. For example, the average price fluctuation of Ethereum starts at $338.54 per currency and ends at $392.90.\nCryptocurrencies are often paralleled with the digital revolution of the emergence of the Internet in the late 1990s. Those who rushed to invest in shares in digital technology companies then faced heavy losses.\nThe cryptocurrency, of course, is a slightly different revolution: it is a currency that practically abolishes the concept of the bank. As revolutionary as it sounds (and it is), it is more prudent to wait a few more years to see how much it will stabilize and how reliable the map of crypto-transactions is in terms of our daily lives.\n\nWe participate in marketing programs, our content is not influenced by any commissions.

{"url":"https://bitnewsbot.com/high-btc-stock-review-4-3-out-of-5-highbtcstock-com-review-how-to-be-a-professional-online-trader/","web_url":"https://bitnewsbot.com/","type":"article","description":"On This Page 👇","title":"High BTC Stock Review (4.3 out of 5) – highbtcstock.com review – How To Be A Professional Online Trader","content":" How To Be A Professional Online Trader\nOn This Page 👇\nI have found many people restraining themselves from considering the possibility of becoming online traders and earning extra income.\nAs a reviewer, I agree with them to some extent because in some cases their fears were genuine as they have seen people losing money to online brokers.\nThis is why we always insist upon newcomers to do their homework which requires a thorough probe of online brokers so that the fears can be eliminated.\nAlternatively, you can read my High BTC Stock review because the information that I am going to share in this review is going to be immensely valuable for them.\nIt is quite difficult to get yourself a platform that is simultaneously user-friendly and suitable for all kinds of traders. To me, the High BTC Stock broker platform is one such platform that is specially built for beginner traders.\nFirstly, it is the most convenient way of platform access which puts it at the top of my list. Access has been one of the major issues with most of the platforms because normally they ask the traders to first download a third-party software. This is not the case with this firm.\nSecondly, a trader is bound to access the platform only through a computer. In the case of the HighBTCStock broker platform, you can easily access the platform if your device has an internet connection. Your laptop, desktop PC, tablet as well as your Android/iOS phone can provide you convenient access to this platform.\nThe second thing which I liked most about the highbtcstock.com broker platform is that it allows traders to trade with a variety of instruments. The instruments it offers come from commodities, stocks, indices, and forex. The firm has more assets from the crypto trading market as well. These are the best markets containing high-yielding assets that can be traded through this firm.\nWhile trading, your option to trade would expand over not only local but global markets. You can choose the instrument of your choice and can then maximize the profits by availing ‘Leverage’ feature provided by this service provider.\nIt also doesn’t matter if you are a beginner and need guidance because High BTC Stock trading firm will provide you with all the assistance you need. These include trading tools, educational and training resources as well as outstanding features.\nThirdly, I had a good look at the trading accounts of highbtcstock.com trading firm. I found them to be most relevant in the sense that they have been so sensibly designed. Irrespective of whichever account you choose, each account individually is good for a beginner, average, and experienced trader.\nAbove all, the account funding requirement is intentionally kept on the lower side which makes them highly accessible as compared to other service provider accounts. Only the advanced types of accounts require a bit more funding than the basic and average accounts.\nTo me, this makes sense because advanced accounts consist of some extraordinary features that nobody would like to let go of easily.\nFor instance, the leverage feature for the advanced accounts is maximum and furthermore, they also come with exclusively risk-free trading features as well.\nThe way I see it, choosing a trading account is a big deal. This is because they consist of both common features and exclusive features.\nHowever, in my view, I think that the resources provided in each of them by the High BTC Stock trading platform are the best you can find in the market.\nMost importantly, you can conveniently benefit from them because they are easy to understand.\nFor instance, much-needed trade-oriented education material is there so that you can improve your trading skills and boost your trading experience. Resources would also include market expert assistance from professional traders, one-on-one training, and access to an online library consisting of e-books, tutorials, etc.\nFurthermore, you will be provided with the most advanced trading tools/features such as market insights, trading alerts, asset indexes, smart charts, and risk management tools.\nRight from the beginning of my High BTC Stock review, I had indicated that fears exist amongst the general public who though want to trade online but are afraid. However, in my personal view, I didn’t come across anything that even remotely suggested to me that this broker is not authentic.\nI even had a good look at this broker’s compliance aspect and found that it strictly adheres to KYC and AML policies which double ensured me that this broker is the right place for potential traders.\nBefore parting and ending my High BTC Stock review, I would reiterate that a thorough probe of a trading service provider is a must. However, if you are considering the possibility of trading online but are afraid, then you can initiate your career through High BTC Stock trading firm.\nI am confident that this firm will eliminate your fears and let you have a career you have always hoped for.
