However, at $169, it's a pricey option.","title":"ELLIPAL Titan review: Beginner-friendly security - Decrypt","content":" In the last five years, cryptocurrency hardware wallets have gone from being an obscure way to securely manage digital assets, to a popular tool used by even inexperienced crypto investors.\nWith an explosion in the number and variety of different digital assets available, the number of hardware wallets on the market has surged; each with their own unique feature set.\nThe ELLIPAL Titan is just one of a number of options in a crowded field of hardware wallets. First released in 2018 and priced at $169, it's heftier than many of its USB stick-sized rivals, with a bulky build that's reminiscent of a smartphone. It's also completely air-gapped for extra security, with no wireless connectivity.\nDoes the ELLIPAL Titan stack up against its sleeker, more modern rivals? We go hands-on to find out.\nThe ELLIPAL Titan resembles a small, robust smartphone, with an aluminum alloy frame that measures a sizable 118 x 66 x 9.7mm. The wallet's completely sealed, making it tamper-resistant; anyone who attempts to disassemble and reassemble the device will leave obvious damage. Its sealed design also makes the ELLIPAL Titan one of the few dust and water-resistant hardware wallets available.\nThe front of the device is dominated by a 4-inch touchscreen display, while the rear adorned with a textured metal rear panel and features a slightly protruding 5-megapixel camera. There is only one button to speak of—a power button located on the right side of the device.\nThe ELLIPAL Titan comes in a flip box that lacks the security seal or holographic sticker some other hardware wallet manufacturers package their products with.\nInside, you will find the ELLIPAL Titan device itself, along with a flat micro-USB charging cable, a security adapter used for updating and charging the device, and several stickers.\nYou also get a quick start guide, thank you note and a card used for storing your 12-word mnemonic recovery phrase.\nInitializing the ELLIPAL Titan is a fairly painless process, and should only take a few minutes for most people. You'll need your smartphone nearby to complete the process.\nAfter selecting your language from the four available options, the ELLIPAL Titan will ask you to download the associated ELLIPAL app. You'll then need to create an account on the device by selecting an account name and a password, following which the ELLIPAL Titan will display your 12-word mnemonic recovery phrase. This needs to be stored in a safe place and confirmed on the device before you can choose which cryptocurrencies to manage on your device.\nOnce that's done, you'll be able to connect each wallet to the ELLIPAL app individually by scanning the QR code presented on the ELLIPAL Titan through its associated smartphone app. Once connected, this cryptocurrency can then be directly managed through the app, while sensitive actions such as sending cryptocurrency will need to be confirmed on the ELLIPAL Titan.\nUnlike most hardware wallets, which draw power through a USB cable, the ELLIPAL Titan features a built-in 1,400 mAh battery with a standby time of up to 259 hours. That means you don't need to plug it into a computer or smartphone to function, and you can tote your wallet about for more than a week without needing to recharge.\nMost wallet management operations are performed on the associated ELLIPAL app, which is available for both iOS and Android devices. Through the app, users can create transactions, before signing them on their ELLIPAL device. The ELLIPAL Titan uses its built-in camera to scan transaction QR codes created on the app—enabling you to verify the transaction address on the Titan's screen before signing it and helping to prevent address-swap attacks. It's typically a quick process, which should take less than a minute if performed correctly.\nThe ELLIPAL Titan's large color touchscreen and Android-like OS make navigating around the device a simple task compared to the miniscule displays and two-button interfaces seen on devices like the Ledger Nano S and Trezor One.\nAs a completely air-gapped device, the ELLIPAL Titan lacks any sort of wireless connectivity. It also lacks any input ports and instead has to be updated using the supplied security adapter, which has a built-in microSD card port.\nThe Titan is also rated IP65 for dust and water resistance, meaning that it's completely dust resistant and is able to withstand weak water jets but not complete submersion. Nevertheless, that's more water-resistant than bestselling wallets like the Ledger Nano X and Trezor One, though it's pipped to the post by the IP68-rated Cobo Vault.\nThe ELLIPAL's associated mobile app comes with some additional features; as well as letting users directly exchange cryptocurrencies with the added security of the associated hardware wallet, it includes market tracking tools and lending products similar to those found on Binance.\nThe Titan is also one of the few cryptocurrency hardware wallets that allow owners to create multiple accounts on the same device. With this feature, users can easily separate their finances into separate accounts, allowing for improved budget and portfolio management. ELLIPAL claims that users can store as many as 10 accounts on a single device, but this can vary based on the size of each account.\nAlthough the ELLIPAL Titan offers features that are difficult to find elsewhere, it does lack the additional functionality provided by some of its rivals, including FIDO U2F support and multi-signature compatibility.\nUnlike many new cryptocurrency hardware wallets, the ELLIPAL Titan completely lacks USB and wireless connectivity. This makes the device immune to network-based and other types of remote attacks. Since the ELLIPAL Titan is an air-gapped cold storage wallet, remote attacks are practically impossible. Physical attacks are similarly difficult, since the wallet will automatically wipe itself if it detects a physical breach.\nThe ELLIPAL Titan's secure enclosure is impact and crush resistant, ensuring funds are kept safe even if the hardware wallet is dropped or knocked.\nAccess to the device is protected by an 8-32 character password which can include symbols. If this password is entered incorrectly too many times, the wallet will be automatically erased. For those who want to add an additional layer of security to their device, the ELLIPAL Titan also supports passphrase protection. This passphrase takes the form of an extra word added to the 12-word recovery phrase, and will need to be entered when attempting to recover the wallet using its recovery seed.\nHowever, like many hardware wallets, including the Trezor One, the Titan can be breached if a sophisticated attacker is able to gain physical access to the device—as was demonstrated by the Ledger Donjon team. Moreover, the ELLIPAL Titan lacks a secure element like those seen in some competing wallets, like the Ledger Nano X and Cobo Vault, which is widely considered to be the gold standard in hardware wallet security.\nNonetheless, most potential exploits can be avoided by simply restricting physical access to the wallet, while keeping its firmware up-to-date.\nThe ELLIPAL Titan supports a total of 33 different blockchains and more than 7,000 tokens—including most of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, as well as some offbeat choices.\nSome of the major supported assets include;\nAccording to its website, ELLIPAL adds new coins to the Titan every month. A full list of supported cryptocurrencies can be found on the ELLIPAL Coin List page. Titan users will need to update the device's firmware using a microSD card to begin managing newly added assets.\nAlthough the ELLIPAL Titan supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, privacy coin holders may be disappointed to find a lack of Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) support.\nAt its current price of $169 (barring discounts), the ELLIPAL Titan sits firmly in the mid-range price bracket, competing with the likes of the Ledger Nano X and Trezor Model T.\nThat $169 buys you a robust device that should thwart practically any remote attack, while allowing you to store dozens of different cryptocurrencies in a single wallet. At around the same size as a small smartphone, the ELLIPAL Titan certainly isn't one of the smallest hardware wallets on the market. However, it does feature one of the largest screens of any hardware wallet, as well as an intuitive user interface, making it suitable for less experienced cryptocurrency holders.\nWhether the ELLIPAL Titan is suitable for your needs will likely depend on whether you favor absolute portability and security, or prefer a mix of security and usability—since the Titan squarely fits the latter option. All-in-all, the Titan is a solid contender in today's hardware wallet market.\n","create_date":"2020-04-17T16:32:07","tag":"ELLIPAL,ELLIPAL Titan,hardware wallet,review","author":"Decrypt / Daniel Phillips"},

It’s like diluting soup, and that could lead to hyperinflation and a collapse in the dollar. And what will be left to consider? Cryptocurrency and gold.\nThat’s the opinion of Caitlin Long, at least. Long, the CEO of Avanti, a regulated crypto bank set to launch in the US next year, and an advisor to the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, sees a paradigm shift in the works.\nSo far, the US has created $2 trillion for a coronavirus stimulus package, nearly all of it out of thin air. With so much borrowed money sloshing around in the economy, she believes the time is nigh for only “real assets” backed by real equity.\n“The virus was the pin that pricked the credit bubble,” she said at Virtual Blockchain Week last night. “A credit bubble has been building in the Western world for more than five decades.”\nShe's referring to 1971 when the US severed the link between the dollar and gold in lieu of fiat—legal tender backed by government decree. The move gave the government more flexibility in expanding and contracting the money supply, as needed.\nIt’s no secret that Long is a fan of Austrian economics, which supports the idea that a rigid gold standard is the only way to “sound money.” She has said she became a convert in 2008, during the last financial collapse.\nThe problem with gold, though, is you can only expand the money supply as fast as you can dig the precious metal out of the ground. But at a time of crisis, when companies need money to stay afloat, that could lead to economic collapse.\nIn a 2017 podcast, Long said she doesn’t necessarily advocate a return to the gold standard, but she does think money should be equity-backed.\nLong believes the current crisis brought on by COVID-19 could cause a collapse in the dollar, forcing people to rethink the real value underlying their assets. According to her, the dollar is going to encounter a “short squeeze of staggering proportions.”\nIT WAS ONE HELLUVA PARTY for US (& Europe) for >50 years—we consumed more than we produced & hangover has now begun. It seems the dollar is having one more short squeeze higher (predictable). Will “almighty dollar” then go by the wayside, just as “sound as a pound” sterling did?\n— Caitlin Long 🔑 (@CaitlinLong_) March 18, 2020\n\nAs Long explained it, the system has been designed in such a way that the incentive is to lever up balance sheets and not pay attention to solvency anymore. \"A lot of publicly traded companies now running to the Fed for a bailout are those who bought their stock back at higher prices,” she said. (In fact, several major US airline companies are guilty of this.)\n“In the old system, the incentive was to lever up and buyback stock and strip capital, and literally hollow out the solvency of the system,” said Long.\nThat's not going to continue to work well, she said. Because many foreign governments and corporations need dollars to finance trade, the pandemic has fueled massive demand for US currency as investors exit markets and seek stable assets. As a result, the global economy is effectively net short dollars, ergo “the short squeeze.”\nIn response to that demand, the US is overissuing dollars. But once the crisis passes and demand drops, the value of the dollar will not be sustained, Long said.\nWhen that happens, balance sheets will start to matter again, if not now, then in the next crisis, she said. \"We want to understand what assets we own that are nobody else’s IOU.” According to an earlier story she wrote in Forbes, that means assets that are no one’s liabilities and have no counterparties. Examples of other equity-based assets are land, physical commodities, and personal property.\nAnd that, of course, leads to crypto, which she refers to as a “naturally equity-based asset.” As long as you own your private keys, nobody else can lay claim to your crypto, argued Long. She compared owning private keys to Bitcoin to owning a deed to real estate or owning an actual physical gold bar. “Those are assets that are no one else’s IOUs.”\nLong cautioned that when it comes to stablecoins, however, because many of those are actual IOUs. In fact, several stablecoins, most notably Tether, are purportedly backed by the US dollar.\n“If you look at the volume of crypto assets that trade every day, well over a third are stablecoins that are backed by IOUs. And also 25% of Bitcoin and Ether are held in third-party custody, so those are IOUs, too,” she said. (She failed to mention another shortfall of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, is their wild volatility. In 2018, Americans lost $1.7 billion trading bitcoin.)\nIn closing, Long advised folks to examine their balance sheets to see which assets might be someone else’s IOU. And along that same line, she said that we have “no clue” whether some cryptocurrency exchanges are solvent. That is because unregulated exchanges are not subject to third-party audits.\n“I for one would be happy if some of the weak balance sheet players flushed out of this industry and let the strong balance sheet players who are providing valuable services, and helping crypto adoption rise [like] cream to the top,” she said.\n","create_date":"2020-04-29T20:46:09","tag":"short-squeezed dollar,bitcoin,Caitlin Long,Avanti","author":"Decrypt / Amy Castor"},

According to the core developer, EIP-4844 sets the foundation for data sharding through the introduction of a new transaction type—the oddly named “data blob.”\nBlob blocks also introduce what’s called a KZG commitment. The name stands for Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg, the names of the original authors who came up with it.\nAccording to Havel, the KZG commitment will point to certain “blobs” of information. That's helpful for layer-2 scaling solutions, like Optimism and Arbitrum, because they batch transactions together in what are known as \"rollups\" and currently have issues accessing data needed to verify those transactions.\nThe easier it is for a rollup to access the data it needs, the faster and cheaper the transactions can be verified and reported back to the Ethereum mainnet.\nAccording to Carl Beekhuizen and Trent van Epps, two members of the Ethereum Foundation who are working on proto-danksharding, the blobs set the foundation for data sharding.\nOn the Epicenter Podcast earlier this year, they clarified the idea, saying that instead of having multiple simultaneous sidechains, there is only one chain but with “crazy” amounts of information.\nThe data can then get split up on the one chain, allowing for individual stakers or smaller sized machines to be responsible only for a sliver of that large amount of information. And, says Havel, that data will only be stored for a few weeks at a time.\nKZG commitments are at the end of their “KZG summoning ceremony,” or a “multi party computation ceremony,” said Havel, which calls upon the community to help with the scaling effort.\nHavel also explained that blobs will only store data for a limited amount of time, and will never touch the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the environment where all smart contracts live and interact with one another, nor the Ethereum state directly.\n“Instead, they will create a KZG commitment, which will allow us to handle data much more efficiently and in a much cheaper way,” he explained, given the fact that blobs are small enough that they make disk use manageable.\nHavel explained that blobs will only store data for a limited amount of time, and will never touch the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). “We will be able to handle data much more efficiently, and in a cheaper way as well,” he concluded.\nAdditional reporting by Rodrigo Martinez.\n","create_date":"2023-07-08T16:01:17","tag":"Layer 2,ETH,Ethereum,Ethereum upgrade,Optimism,Arbitrum,proto-danksharding,eip-4844,data blobs","author":"Decrypt / Pedro Solimano"},

More broadly, the protests, which have so far led to more than 6,000 arrests, are a reaction to China’s growing influence over Hong Kong.\nSpeaking in front of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, Lee said, “Under Hong Kong law, law enforcement agencies have the responsibility to prevent and detect crime to protect citizens' lives and property.”\nHe said that 3,721 phones have been seized by police from June to November 2019. The police conducted “digital forensic examinations,” said Lee, declining how these forensic examinations operated.\nJoshua Wong, the leader of the pro-democracy Umbrella movement, tweeted last month that text messages from his phone—which had been seized by police—surfaced in court trials, despite him never giving police the passwords. Police said they had obtained a warrant, reported the South China Morning Post.\nLee’s comments have drawn sharp criticism from the cryptocurrency industry, which champions privacy and self-sovereignty as a fundamental right.\nFernando Gutierrez, CMO of the Dash Core Group, an organization that serves the privacy coin, Dash, told Decrypt, “We understand the need for authorities to fight crime, but not by renouncing privacy. Authorities are not always right or trustworthy, so the authorities-know-better approach is not acceptable.\n“Individuals should have a choice about what is public and what is private. Cryptography is the most potent tool available to the individual to defend from bigger and more mighty beasts, like governments, but also from smaller ones, like all sorts of criminals. With cryptocurrencies, we extend that power to money, which is extremely potent,” he added.\nDiego Salazar, who helped design the website for the privacy coin Monero, told Decrypt that he found the news worrying. “This is our future. Those in the west first world are not safe if we do nothing. It's only a matter of time. The feds are already saying they want to backdoor encryption.”\nLee, the Hong Kong official, cited a previous ruling from 2017, which said that, in demanding situations, police could examine the contents of arrested people’s phones without a warrant.\nTo that, Gutierrez added, “What is happening in Hong Kong is relevant everywhere because it shows what governments do when there are no checks in place. However, we can get to the same situation slowly if nobody cares or looks. If we don't stay vigilant and use the available protections, surveillance will keep growing, and our right to privacy will die like the proverbial slowly-boiled frog.”\nAnd that’s not the way anybody wants to go out.\n","create_date":"2020-01-11T12:11:14","tag":"Hong Kong,monero,seizure,phones,Blockchain,crypto,Dash","author":"Decrypt / Robert Stevens"},

Here's what it means for crypto startups—and you.","title":"Welcome to Wyoming: the Blockchain State - Decrypt","content":" Over the past few weeks, Wyoming’s legislature has deliberately passed a number of bills that will almost certainly be signed by the governor and become law. In so doing, Wyoming is making a play to be most crypto friendly state in the country—and an example for other states, and perhaps even D.C., to follow.\nIt’s clear that Wyoming, a state known more for its vast ranch lands than its technological developments, is making a bid to become the Malta of the Americas, a safe haven for the burgeoning crypto industry. But what does it mean to the industry itself?\nPlenty, say lawyers and regulatory pundits. For starters, Wyoming is attempting to clarify the regulatory framework for ownership of crypto assets. Currently, every business engaged in cryptocurrency lending or coin custody—from crypto exchanges like Coinbase to blockchain-loan platforms like SALT—are taking on significant legal risk as an ordinary part of their day-to-day operations.\nThe problem is no one can say with certainty how a court will handle any sort of dispute stemming from litigation or bankruptcy that challenges the question of to whom a crypto asset truly belongs.\nDrew Hinkes, an adjunct professor at NYU Law and Athena Blockchain general counsel, explains that, as it stands, sorting out the legal status of blockchain-based digital assets at the federal level in the United States is a mess. Each federal agency, whether it’s the IRS, FinCen, the SEC or the CFTC, has its own incentives for defining crypto in its own specific way. “There is no consensus—and I use that word half-ironically—as to what you actually own when you own a crypto asset,” he says.\n“There’s this predicate assumption that when someone has a private key associated with a wallet that controls some crypto asset, that you own it,” says Hinkes. And while a judge might agree with that assumption, there is nothing on the books that spells it out in black and white—that is, until now.\nWyoming is now the first state to offer a clear set of property rights for three kinds of blockchain-based assets: a digital security (investment contracts), a digital consumer asset (utility tokens), and virtual currencies (bitcoin and ether, for example). What’s more, in the absence of such rules, certain specialized crypto-based businesses will struggle to get off the ground. “It complicates lending,” for example, says Hinkes. “It complicates the ability to take or give security interest, and it complicates the ability to establish derivative products based on crypto.”\nFor example, companies that provide crypto-backed loans like BlockFi, if established in Wyoming, can now avail themselves of the legal backing of the state’s “Digital assets-existing law bill” (SF0125), which leaves no question as to their claims to bitcoin or an Ethereum-based token once a customer has delegated them authority. And for investors, they can rest assured that their bitcoins aren’t being loaned out more than once, and that the lender is fully collateralized at all times (which protects against artificially inflating the number of bitcoins in circulation)—something that isn’t available anywhere else at the moment.\nThe uncertainty regarding ownership rights for crypto has other effects as well. “You can go down a rabbit hole of all kinds of really bizarre and interesting implications,” says Hinkes. “If you don’t really own it, should you be paying taxes to buy it? Or are you actually having a taxable transaction when you sell it?” What’s more, how ownership is ultimately defined for these assets will determine how they are regulated. “If an instrument is regulated like a commodity versus a security, transactions work very differently,” says the attorney. “The markets that allow these transactions are also structured very differently.”\nAnd while each piece of legislation that Wyoming recently passed is distinct and important in its own away, they all seek the same ends: (1) a signal for crypto startups to reconsider those New York and Delaware state incorporations and instead make the trek out to the Rockies; and (2) the mainstreaming and financialization of crypto.\nI'm very bullish on the CO/WY crypto scene.\n+ Legit people / companies are already here (@RadarRelay @ShapeShift_io @zcashco @IOHK_Charles) + Denver is ~90 minutes from Cheyenne (WY capital where all reg innovation is happening) + This region is paradise for outdoorsy people\n— Ryan Selkis (@twobitidiot) February 17, 2019\n\n“If we want [crypto assets] to be fully financialized and commercialized, and if we want people who own them to maximize their value, there’s a desire to have a well understood set of property rights around them,” Hinkes says.\nBy disambiguating ownership questions regarding digital assets, Wyoming aims to begin to untangle this web. And if it’s successful, we can expect other states to follow suit. “We’ve seen this play out beautifully in the cannabis sector,” says the professor.\nAnd who knows, if enough states jump aboard the blockchain bandwagon, maybe then the alphabet soup agencies in D.C. will even take a hint.\n","create_date":"2019-02-19T15:58:24","tag":"ENTREPRENEURSHIP,cryptocurrency,Startups,Wyoming","author":"Decrypt / Guillermo Jimenez"},

With South Korea's National Assembly focused on its response to the virus outbreak, it’s expected to delay passing key cryptocurrency legislation until March.\nCongress was originally scheduled to pass a regulatory framework that adopts cryptocurrency guidelines laid out by G7 watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\nIn June 2019, the FATF released regulatory guidelines that would see governments tightening control over cryptocurrency exchanges and financial service providers dealing with digital assets. The guidelines require stricter anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing prevention compliance from companies.\nThe National Assembly of South Korea had already approved the framework in November 2019; it was awaiting final approval from the Congress.\nWhen passed, the legislation would apply more pressure on existing cryptocurrency exchanges to adhere to rigorous AML policies, which would give the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and other relevant financial authorities in South Korea more control over the cryptocurrency exchange market.\nIt would also legitimize the local cryptocurrency market, since exchanges will have to register with the FSC and obtain an information security management (ISMS) license to operate.\nSouth Korea’s proposed cryptocurrency legislation in South Korea is similar to that already approved in Hong Kong. Earlier this month, Hong Kong’s financial watchdog formalized strengthened AML and terrorist financing prevention requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges.\nFollowing the encouragement of the G20 to all of its member countries to adopt the cryptocurrency guideline created by the FATF, most major cryptocurrency markets including Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong have quickly implemented stricter policies to govern cryptocurrency firms.\nStricter requirements could create a challenging environment for both minor and large-scale cryptocurrency exchanges, especially with the volume of the cryptocurrency market dropping since mid-2019. On BitMEX, for instance, weekly volume of the Bitcoin perpetual swap has dropped from $55 billion to $19 billion since June 24, 2019.\nIt comes after a difficult year for South Korean exchanges, with leading lights Bithumb and UPbit having faced high profile hacks, investigations, and hefty tax bills.\n","create_date":"2020-02-28T09:59:21","tag":"south korea,bithumb,bitmex,crypto exchange,upbit","author":"Decrypt / Joseph Young"},

What it got instead was a #DeleteCoinbase movement on social media.\nThe reason, according to a tirade of critics, was down to all three members of Neutrino’s board being previously involved in a company called Hacking Team. The company, based in Italy, is alleged to have sold spyware to oppressive regimes in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Venezuela. Coinbase, in a bid to salvage the purchase, has sacked Neutrino’s executive board. But this just opens up even more questions.\nIn an original statement, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the acquisition was made because other blockchain analytics providers did not offer support for the broad range of cryptocurrencies the exchange had on its books. However, it was later revealed that the acquisition was in fact, designed to help stop third parties selling user data. Armstrong admitted Coinbase did not do enough due diligence, and as a result, those who worked at Hacking Team will transition out of Coinbase.\nAccording to its website, Neutrino only has three team members: CEO Giancarlo Russo, CTO Alberto Ornaghi, and CRO Marco Valleri, all based in Milan, Italy. These have all been involved with Hacking Team, with Ornaghi and Valleri being the two founding members of it. This means Coinbase will have to fire its entire executive suite. But if Coinbase does sack the whole team, who will run the company?\nSome have suggested that the team members might be spun out to a separate company and then be contracted by Coinbase to run the Neutrino software. Developer Udi Wertheimer—who was a big supporter of the #DeleteCoinbase movement—said on Twitter, “Coinbase customers will want to know that these people weren’t just ‘transitioned out’, but that Coinbase doesn’t use them or their companies as contractors either.” A similar post on Reddit asked a bunch of similar questions.\n2/ BUT... there’s still too much ambiguity, and while I applaud Brian for not doubling down, I’m disappointed in the lack of clarity here.\nWho exactly is going to be transitioned out? We need names. When will they be transitioned out? This needs to happen IMMEDIATELY.\n— Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) March 5, 2019\n\nCoinbase is already fighting fires after news emerged this week that the company had been leaking data. While head of sales Christine Sandler admitted its former analytics provider had been selling data, there has been no official statement over the scale of the leak and what kind of data was sold.\nThis uncertainty is unlikely to dampen the spirits of those who are protesting. Perhaps instead of hiring an analytics platform to investigate its customers, it needs to be more forthcoming about its own shortcomings.\n","create_date":"2019-03-05T10:50:40","tag":"public relations disaster,blockchain analytics,crypto exchange Coinbase","author":"Decrypt / Tim Copeland"},

It appears they stumbled across the coin only recently and took to BitcoinTalk to find out what to do with the massive stash.\n2010 wallet moving coins https://t.co/gSFn1ypESD pic.twitter.com/8rt0lGBtIX\n— red (@redxbt) March 13, 2020\n\n\"I mined some bitcoin for a little bit, a long time ago; back when it was still possible to mine with GPU.

While the miner didn't specify, later that day a transaction was made moving 1,000 Bitcoin, worth $7.95 million at the time.\nThese coins were originally mined on August 24, 2010—suggesting they belonged to this poster. It's rare to see coins that have been stagnant for so long suddenly move.\nBut the stash was likely even bigger. Since the Bitcoin blockchain has been forked a number of times since 2010, the wallet also contained 1,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 1,000 Bitcoin SV (BSV) and so on. Just these two coins, when combined, add an extra $475,000.\n\"Thank you all for all the suggestions.

But is it a cut above the Nano S?","title":"Ledger Nano X Review (2021): An Expensive Step In The Right Direction - Decrypt","content":" \n\nSince cryptocurrencies were invented over a decade ago, there have been many attempts to build more advanced, secure and user-friendly walletsto store them.\nAs of 2021, the current gold standard for security is known as a hardware wallet—a physical device that stores your cryptocurrency private keys in a secure offline environment.\nOne of the most prominent companies involved in moving the needle forward is Ledger, the firm behind the popular, but flawed Ledger Nano S hardware wallet—and the Ledger Nano X, its flagship device.\nWith a bigger screen, Bluetooth connectivity and a built-in battery, the Nano X is certainly an upgrade—but does it live up to the hype? Let's find out.\nAt 72mm x 18.6mm x 11.75mm with a weight of 34g, the Ledger Nano X is almost twice as large and more than twice as heavy as the Ledger Nano S.\nOne reason for the Nano X's greater bulk is that it has a built-in 100mAH battery, meaning that you can use it on the move—unlike its predecessor, which had to be plugged into a PC using a USB cable to draw power. Also filling out its frame are increased memory and a larger OLED screen.\nAs we can see, although the Ledger Nano X is far smaller than the KeepKey wallet and the Ledger Blue, it is noticeably larger than the Nano S and Trezor Model One. Nonetheless, it is still an incredibly small device, and is roughly comparable in size to a common USB pen drive.\nOverall, the Ledger Nano X has a modern aesthetic that is similar to the Ledger Nano S, albeit more streamlined, since the buttons are now built into the body of the device and sit flush with the casing.\nThe Ledger Nano X comes supplied in a small cellophane-wrapped box, measuring approximately 80mm x 131mm x 31mm. Interestingly, Ledger chooses not to use tamper-evident seals on its packaging, stating that they're \"easy to counterfeit and can therefore be misleading.\"\nInside the box, you'll find the Ledger Nano X device (obviously), in addition to a braided USB A to USB C cable and a keychain strap. Documentation includes a getting started leaflet, three recovery sheets (for recording recovery phrases) as well as several stickers featuring Ledger branding.\nThe Nano X may be heftier than the Nano S, but it's still a small device. As a result, navigating through the on-device menu isn't exactly the simplest process in the world—particularly when considering the fact that it only has two buttons. However, the larger screen and controls make for a significantly less fiddly user experience than that of the Ledger Nano S.\nNavigating the device's menu involves scrolling left or right using the left and right button respectively, or selecting options by pressing both buttons simultaneously. Beyond this, most of the action actually occurs on the associated Ledger Live application, with the Ledger device itself being mostly used for verifying addresses and authorizing transactions.\nThe Ledger Nano X's larger screen resolves one of the most common gripes about the Nano S, since crypto addresses can now be displayed in their entirety instead of requiring you to scroll. One niggling issue is that the Nano X ships with a relatively short USB cable—just 50cm long, which can make it difficult to use if your computer isn't in a convenient location.\nTo begin using the device, you'll first need to download and install the Ledger Live client for your operating system. This is currently available for most desktop operating systems including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, as well as mobile operating systems like iOS and Android.\nOnce Ledger Live is up and running, you can power up the Ledger Nano X device by holding the left button, after which you'll be able to navigate through the startup screens to configure the device.\nThis will involve choosing a 4 to 8 digit PIN code, and backing up and verifying the randomly generated 24-word recovery phrase shown on the device. Overall, this process takes around 5 to 10 minutes, and only needs to be completed once.\nBy default, the device doesn't ship with any preinstalled wallet apps. Instead, these need to be manually downloaded by connecting the Ledger Nano X with Ledger Live. Thanks to its Bluetooth capabilities, the Ledger Nano X is able to pair with mobile devices running Ledger Live wirelessly; if you're using the device with a desktop PC, you'll have to use the supplied USB cable.\nAs a hardware wallet, the Ledger Nano X is primarily designed for the safe storage of cryptocurrencies and other crypto assets. Because of this, the Ledger Nano X is compatible with practically every major cryptoasset, while support for new assets is added regularly.\nThe Ledger Nano X also overcomes one of the major limitations of its Ledger Nano S, by bumping the available internal memory from 320kb up to 2048kb. This allows users to store up to 100 apps on their device at once—considerably more than the 3 to 7 simultaneous apps the Ledger Nano S could hold. This means the Ledger Nano X can currently hold the entire app library simultaneously—avoiding the need to manually remove and switch out apps due to memory constraints.\nWhile the vast majority of these apps allow the wallet to hold additional cryptocurrencies and tokens, a handful impart additional functionality to the Nano X. For example, the FIDO U2F app turns the device into a two-factor authentication key, whereas the recovery check app can be used to ensure you have correctly saved your recovery phrase.\nMoreover, the Ledger Nano X is the first cryptocurrency hardware wallet to include a built-in 100mAH battery, a necessary upgrade since the device now features Bluetooth connectivity out of the box. This allows the device to connect to mobile devices wirelessly, whereas the older Ledger Nano S could only connect to mobile devices using a Ledger OTG Kit.\nWith the addition of wireless connectivity, increased memory, and a much larger screen, Ledger has clearly paid attention to the shortcomings of its earlier products and is trying to make safely storing crypto assets a less challenging task.\nThe Ledger Nano X is compatible with well over 1,000 digital assets, including 23 coins and all ERC-20 tokens. Many of these can be managed through Ledger Live, whereas some require the Ledger Nano X to be used in conjunction with a compatible wallet. Supported crypto assets include;\nThe Ledger Nano X supports practically every crypto asset supported by the Ledger Nano S, but is able to hold more of the relevant wallet apps at any one time thanks to its expanded internal memory.\nAs such, the Ledger Nano X is ideal for securing diverse portfolios, though individuals looking to store newly released crypto assets may need to wait until Ledger adds support for them.\nAs a hardware wallet, the Ledger Nano X targets the minority of cryptocurrency users that value security above all else. As such, the team behind the product has clearly put a great deal of thought into the potential ways such a device could be attacked, and have incorporated a huge number of potential safeguards into its design.\nLike all Ledger devices, the Nano X features state-of-the-art security and incorporates a physically isolated security element certified as CC EAL5+. These secure elements are similar to those used to secure credit and debit cards, and are the standard used by banks for the protection of financial information.\nThe device also features a dual-core MCU which runs a proprietary operating system known as BOLOS and controls communication between the connected device and the Ledger secure element.\nAlthough the addition of Bluetooth theoretically increases the number of potential entry points hackers could use to compromise the device, the Ledger Nano X encrypts Bluetooth traffic between the mobile device and requires manual verification for all important device actions.\nBeyond this, Ledger's Nano X and Nano S are the only hardware wallets to receive CSPN (First Level Security Certificate) certification, which means their security has been independently certified by ANSSI—the National Cybersecurity Agency of France.\nThese hardware-based security measures are also supplemented with several software-based ones, including a 4-8 digital security PIN, automatic inactivity lockouts and an optional Ledger Live password lock.\nOverall, the Ledger Nano X is without question one of the most secure cold storage solutions on the market.\nHowever, although its devices offer a high level of security, Ledger has experienced some security lapses as a company.\nIn June 2020, data from the company's e-commerce database was leaked, resulting in over a million customer records being posted to hacker forums. Some quarter of a million records included details such as physical addresses and phone numbers—exposing Ledger customers to the threat of phishing attacks and even threats.\nRecently, we shared news of a data dump. On December 23, we were alerted by our e-commerce provider Shopify about an incident in April & June '20 where their rogue team members exported merchants' customer databases. Ledger was included. More details: https://t.co/NHU3IbDL0a pic.twitter.com/DHQQ9arxCu\n— Ledger (@Ledger) January 13, 2021\n\nWhile Ledger has committed to changing how it handles customer data and identifying and prosecuting those responsible, it's an embarrassing lapse for a company whose business is the security of your crypto.\nThe Ledger Nano X is currently available for purchase from the official Ledger website for $119. With that said, it can often be found for cheaper at authorized third-party retailers as well as official resellers on Amazon. You should exercise caution when purchasing any hardware wallet, making sure to only purchase from authorized sources, and never using any hardware wallet that has already been configured.\nAt twice the price of the Ledger Nano S, the Nano X is one of the more expensive hardware wallets on the market. If portability and usability are your top concerns, it's probably worth the hit on your wallet—but if you're already happy with the Ledger Nano S, there's little reason to upgrade.\nThe addition of Bluetooth and massively expanded internal memory are steps in the right direction, whereas the huge range of supported cryptocurrencies means that even the most diverse cryptocurrency investors can secure their entire portfolio.\nThe Ledger Nano X is an excellent product marred only by its high price tag; those in the market for a less expensive alternative may want to take a look at the cheaper, but dated Ledger Nano S.\nRating: 4/5\n","create_date":"2021-02-26T18:15:27","tag":"ledger,hardware reviews,hardware wallet,hardware wallets,review,Reviews,bitcoin hardware wallet,best ethereum wallet,crypto hardware wallets","author":"Decrypt / Daniel Phillips"},

Japan announced a $1 trillion deal of its own last month and G20 leaders have put forward $5 trillion in stimulus payments.\nThe US debt alone has exceeded $24 trillion recently as the Federal Reserve is injecting unprecedented amounts of money into the economy, trying to counter the impact of the pandemic.\nAs Decrypt reported on April 9, Bank of America's analysts predict that the Fed’s actions could cause its balance sheet to reach over $9 trillion by the end of 2020—over 40% of the US gross domestic product (GDP).\nAt the same time, Krishna Guha, a vice-chairman at Evercore ISI, believes that it could reach as much as $12 trillion by the middle of the year, or 60% of the US GDP.\nIn their turn, both Germany and Italy have already allocated over 30% of their respective GDPs to efforts such as direct spending, bank guarantees as well as loan and equity injections. These stimuli amounted to $1.84 trillion in aid, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n“Governments worldwide are unleashing fiscal support measures, but not all fiscal packages are the same,” said Chua Hak Bin, a senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research in Singapore, adding that “While ‘fiscal bazookas’ are the norm in the more advanced economies, emerging markets don’t have that kind of ammunition and fiscal space. Their fiscal packages are more water pistols than bazookas.”\nWhile the extreme rate at which states are printing money to counter the economic impact of the pandemic could be concerning in the long term, some experts believe that government and central bank stimuli are actually “good for Bitcoin,” especially as the next mining reward halving is just around the corner.\n“As things stand, we are in line to post a 182% rise for Bitcoin since the lows of December 2018, and the surge we are currently seeing paints a bullish picture for the months following this third halving,” Joshua Mahony, a senior market analyst at UK-based derivatives trading company IG Group, told Decrypt.\nHe said the huge growth in central bank easing and government debt highlights why many feel the need to store their wealth in alternative assets to avoid the apparent depreciation that could be on the cards.\n“Crucially, this drive higher appears to be feeding into the historical pre-halving trend that could point towards a huge upside over the coming year. [...] The truth on the ground is very different and the desperation to keep markets pushing higher means we are likely to see more and more stimulus come into force. That is good for Bitcoin and other non-fiat assets such as gold,” said Mahony.\nMati Greenspan, the founder of Quantum Economics, came to a similar conclusion, noting that as central banks have recently reaffirmed their commitment to creating even more “free money,” Bitcoin is now the best performing asset this year.\n“Just like it's done nearly every year since inception,” he added.\nTips\nHave a news tip or inside information on a crypto, blockchain, or Web3 project?

Adding insult to injury, altcoin markets fell in tandem—erasing $25 billion from the total crypto market cap.\nUnlike previous dumps, however, Bitcoin's latest descent appeared to be correlated with systemic risk resulting from Covid-19—and mirrored movements in the stock markets.\nAs governments took unprecedented measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus, including travel bans and lockdowns of metropolitan areas, markets around the world posted the most dramatic freefall since the 2008 recession. The US equities market cited a loss of $11.5 trillion, wiping off almost four years of solid gains. And even gold—the ultimate safe haven—fell to a 3-month low, following a sheer 10% drop in the same week.\nWith the coronavirus panic transcending markets and breaking convention, Decrypt asked leading cryptocurrency and finance experts to give their verdict on the best, middle, and worst-case-scenarios for Bitcoin in the coming weeks.\nThey say it's best to end on a high note. So, with that in mind—here's the bad news first.\nRight now, the coronavirus is showing no tangible signs of slowing, though scattered data suggests that the arrival of spring and summer may help curb the virus.\n\"Should the virus continue to spread, it will likely be devastating for all assets, including Bitcoin,\" Mati Greenspan, the founder of Quantum Economics, told Decrypt.\nIt's not just Bitcoin's value at stake, either. Luno Exchange CEO Marcus Swanepoel told Decrypt that adoption rates would be \"mildly affected.\" Which, in turn, would impact BTCs price \"in the short to medium-term.\" It's not unexpected—especially in the wake of a significant crash—to see adoption rates slow; after all, blood filling the street doesn't exactly scream 'jump in.'\nNevertheless, Swanepoel added the caveat that sluggish adoption is not something that will spell significant trouble in the long run. \"Bitcoin will recover to its original value,\" he said.\nGold’s luster as a safe haven might have tarnished in the current crisis, but Bitcoin’s own price plunge has made it difficult to maintain its risk-off narrative. Amid this recent slump, even the most ardent proponents of Bitcoin's safe-haven status have been forced to reevaluate, with the likes of Tyler Winklevoss tweeting that, “The fact that it's not acting how you might expect only underscores just how early it is.”\nIf bitcoin isn't gold 2.0, then what is it? The fact that it's not acting how you might expect only underscores just how early it is.\n— Tyler Winklevoss (@tylerwinklevoss) March 14, 2020\n\nRan Neuner, the host of CNBC's Crypto Trader, suggests this is a lingering sore spot for BTC. \"I fear that Bitcoin may be going through a mild identity crisis,\" he told Decrypt. Neuner implies that Bitcoin's safe-haven standing counted on its not being correlated to traditional assets, a thesis that had held—until the recent crisis.\nI fear that Bitcoin may be going through a mild identity crisis.\n\"Bitcoin is now being tested for the first time and it is, unfortunately, behaving like a highly correlated asset,\" he said. \"I suspect Corona and its implications will be very far reaching and be here for a long while. I suspect that central banks, driven by the USA and Trump's needs to win an election will do much more damage to the already over inflated economy and hence I think Bitcoin’s true test is now.\"\nRegardless of the naysayers, venture capitalist and BTC bull Tim Draper told Decrypt that he stands by Bitcoin as a hedge against macro risk.\n\"I expect Bitcoin to balance between a safe harbor like gold and a stock like Amazon. Buyers will want to store value in the face of a downturn. The sellers will be strapped for cash and be forced to sell,\" Draper explained.\nStill, with the equities markets in a shambles, gold expunging its 2020 gains, and Bitcoin capitulating on a grand scale—there might soon be nowhere else to turn.\n\nIn an attempt to stem the bleeding markets, the world's economies have begun rolling out stimulus packages. Last week the UK announced emergency spending to the tune of $39 billion. This boost came in conjunction with the Bank of England slashing interest rates by half a percent.\nThe US followed suit on Sunday, with its own economic life preserver. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero and pumped $700 billion into the financial sector.\nThe Federal Reserve just ran a $700 billion marketing campaign for Bitcoin.\n— Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) March 16, 2020\n\nHowever, lengthy deliberations on a fitting coronavirus stimulus package have decelerated the US government's efforts to revive the markets.\nNevertheless, once passed, the package—along with the Fed’s intervention—could be the defibrillator needed to restart the US economy. And the Trump administration is considering even bolder moves; just today, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin floated a plan to send out $1,000 in unrestricted cash to Americans to help them pay the bills.\nHUGE.\nTreasury Sec Steve Mnuchin: \"We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately...Americans need cash now and the president wants to get cash now. And I mean now, in the next two weeks.\"\nHow much?\nMnuchin: Discussing details w/ GOP senators. We like idea of $1K.\n— Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) March 17, 2020\n\nAs long as Bitcoin continues to move in step with traditional assets, America's efforts could prove to lessen some of the ongoing pain.\n\"Any kind of stimulus is more money in the system,\" says Swanepoel, alluding to the notion of stimulus trickling into the crypto markets.\nEconomic meddling aside, Greenspan affirms that as long as efforts to contain the coronavirus prove constructive, Bitcoin could be in for a \"full recovery within the next few months.\"\nNow for the good news. For the most part, the consensus appears to be wholly positive for Bitcoin, in the long term.\n\"The best-case scenario is people recognizing Bitcoin as a safe haven,\" says Swanepoel. \"If that's the case, it will then become one of the world's biggest asset classes in just a matter of months.\"\nWhile some have distanced themselves from the “Bitcoin as digital gold” analogy, Swanepoel implies that now is the perfect time to draw a parallel between them. \"If we look at gold during the financial crisis, we saw its price fall by 25% and then totally recover all losses in a very short space of time. In 4-6 months, we should have a far clearer picture,\" he argues.\nIndeed, the same happened in late February. Gold slumped from its previous 7-year high—only to stabilize, rebound, and break its previous record. Now—despite Goldman Sachs declaring it \"immune\" to coronavirus—the precious metal finds itself at a similar impasse to Bitcoin.\nNeuner concurs with Swanepoel, suggesting that Bitcoin might just need a little time to adjust.\n\"It is simply too soon to come to any conclusion or to speak credibly about BTC as a non correlated asset,\" he said. \"The true test of correlation comes over a long period of time, through multiple bull and bear markets, crises and recessions, and this is something that gold has managed to establish.\"\nMeanwhile, Greenspan maintains that Bitcoin can only come out on top once the virus has vanished and the economic status quo has returned. \"Should this scenario materialize it would be very good for asset prices across the board and present quite an opportunity for all investors,\" he said.\nDraper, however, goes a step further. With coronavirus frenzy nearing fever pitch, and investors seeking an exit route out of every perceivable risk, he sees an opportunity for BTC to overhaul the global financial infrastructure.\nIt is possible that this crisis drives people to look at Bitcoin as an alternative to the current shaky banking system.\n\"It is possible that this crisis drives people to look at Bitcoin as an alternative to the current shaky banking system,\" Draper says, \"People could start recognizing that their governments need transforming, and the governments start realizing that they need to provide better services for lower taxes and see opportunities to better provide those services via Bitcoin.\"\nIn the meantime—despite its price taking a tumble—Bitcoin remains fundamentally unscathed. In its ten-year lifespan, BTC has crashed and recovered in countless cycles, been declared dead 380 times and counting—and yet somehow, has managed to prevail time and again.\nDisclaimer\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.\n","create_date":"2020-03-17T18:40:37","tag":"gold,federal reserve,bitcoin,coronavirus,stock market","author":"Decrypt / Will Heasman"},

That scrutiny recently led to several of Facebook’s major payment partners, including PayPal, MasterCard, Visa and Stripe, dropping their support for the project.\nBut in a first today, Zuckerberg said that Facebook would abandon the project if it didn’t receive approval from “all” regulators. He added that the company would be “forced” to abandon the Libra Association, the consortium that governs the project, if the 21 members chose to proceed regardless. \"Of course, as a big company, we're not going to do something that isn't regulated or is decentralized,” said Zuckerberg, apparently contradicting the original mission statement for Libra.\nSimilarly, when lawmakers suggested that the “permissionless” system Facebook plans to create could encourage developers to build anonymous wallets—useful for money laundering—he vowed to ban them from the platform, while saying, again, that he couldn’t speak for the other members of the Libra Association.\nHe also explained why Facebook had not opted for a dollar-based payment system, or a system tied to another national currency, instead opting to create a wholly new, digital currency. He said that infrastructure for a Chinese-style payment system, like the popular Alipay, didn’t yet exist in the U.S., but nevertheless acknowledged that a fiat-based system might work as an alternative. Asked by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) whether it would be a problem if a member of the Libra Association chose to replace the dollar in the “basket” of currencies backing the Libra, Zuckerberg demurred: he hadn’t considered it.\nElsewhere, representatives were keen to voice their disapproval of the project. Maxine Waters, who chairs the committee, called for a “moratorium” on the project entirely, urging the company to improve its record on diversity, advertising standards, consumer protections, antitrust issues, political interference, freedom of speech and privacy before attempting to move forward with anything else.\nIn his testimony at the start of the hearing, made public Tuesday, Zuckerberg said that he understood lawmakers’ queasiness about the Libra project, acknowledging that it was “difficult” to trust Facebook. He repeated the refrain that responsibility for the digital currency should be deferred to the 21 members of the Libra Association.\nHe also said that the “risks of not innovating” threatened to give overseas competitors, particularly China, an advantage in the burgeoning field of digital currencies. But he acknowledged that he wasn’t “the ideal messenger for this right now.”\nThis is a developing story...\n","create_date":"2019-10-23T16:12:16","tag":"","author":"Decrypt / Ben Munster"},

But is it a cut above the Nano S?","title":"Ledger Nano X Review (2021): An Expensive Step In The Right Direction - Decrypt","content":" \n\nSince cryptocurrencies were invented over a decade ago, there have been many attempts to build more advanced, secure and user-friendly walletsto store them.\nAs of 2021, the current gold standard for security is known as a hardware wallet—a physical device that stores your cryptocurrency private keys in a secure offline environment.\nOne of the most prominent companies involved in moving the needle forward is Ledger, the firm behind the popular, but flawed Ledger Nano S hardware wallet—and the Ledger Nano X, its flagship device.\nWith a bigger screen, Bluetooth connectivity and a built-in battery, the Nano X is certainly an upgrade—but does it live up to the hype? Let's find out.\nAt 72mm x 18.6mm x 11.75mm with a weight of 34g, the Ledger Nano X is almost twice as large and more than twice as heavy as the Ledger Nano S.\nOne reason for the Nano X's greater bulk is that it has a built-in 100mAH battery, meaning that you can use it on the move—unlike its predecessor, which had to be plugged into a PC using a USB cable to draw power. Also filling out its frame are increased memory and a larger OLED screen.\nAs we can see, although the Ledger Nano X is far smaller than the KeepKey wallet and the Ledger Blue, it is noticeably larger than the Nano S and Trezor Model One. Nonetheless, it is still an incredibly small device, and is roughly comparable in size to a common USB pen drive.\nOverall, the Ledger Nano X has a modern aesthetic that is similar to the Ledger Nano S, albeit more streamlined, since the buttons are now built into the body of the device and sit flush with the casing.\nThe Ledger Nano X comes supplied in a small cellophane-wrapped box, measuring approximately 80mm x 131mm x 31mm. Interestingly, Ledger chooses not to use tamper-evident seals on its packaging, stating that they're \"easy to counterfeit and can therefore be misleading.\"\nInside the box, you'll find the Ledger Nano X device (obviously), in addition to a braided USB A to USB C cable and a keychain strap. Documentation includes a getting started leaflet, three recovery sheets (for recording recovery phrases) as well as several stickers featuring Ledger branding.\nThe Nano X may be heftier than the Nano S, but it's still a small device. As a result, navigating through the on-device menu isn't exactly the simplest process in the world—particularly when considering the fact that it only has two buttons. However, the larger screen and controls make for a significantly less fiddly user experience than that of the Ledger Nano S.\nNavigating the device's menu involves scrolling left or right using the left and right button respectively, or selecting options by pressing both buttons simultaneously. Beyond this, most of the action actually occurs on the associated Ledger Live application, with the Ledger device itself being mostly used for verifying addresses and authorizing transactions.\nThe Ledger Nano X's larger screen resolves one of the most common gripes about the Nano S, since crypto addresses can now be displayed in their entirety instead of requiring you to scroll. One niggling issue is that the Nano X ships with a relatively short USB cable—just 50cm long, which can make it difficult to use if your computer isn't in a convenient location.\nTo begin using the device, you'll first need to download and install the Ledger Live client for your operating system. This is currently available for most desktop operating systems including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, as well as mobile operating systems like iOS and Android.\nOnce Ledger Live is up and running, you can power up the Ledger Nano X device by holding the left button, after which you'll be able to navigate through the startup screens to configure the device.\nThis will involve choosing a 4 to 8 digit PIN code, and backing up and verifying the randomly generated 24-word recovery phrase shown on the device. Overall, this process takes around 5 to 10 minutes, and only needs to be completed once.\nBy default, the device doesn't ship with any preinstalled wallet apps. Instead, these need to be manually downloaded by connecting the Ledger Nano X with Ledger Live. Thanks to its Bluetooth capabilities, the Ledger Nano X is able to pair with mobile devices running Ledger Live wirelessly; if you're using the device with a desktop PC, you'll have to use the supplied USB cable.\nAs a hardware wallet, the Ledger Nano X is primarily designed for the safe storage of cryptocurrencies and other crypto assets. Because of this, the Ledger Nano X is compatible with practically every major cryptoasset, while support for new assets is added regularly.\nThe Ledger Nano X also overcomes one of the major limitations of its Ledger Nano S, by bumping the available internal memory from 320kb up to 2048kb. This allows users to store up to 100 apps on their device at once—considerably more than the 3 to 7 simultaneous apps the Ledger Nano S could hold. This means the Ledger Nano X can currently hold the entire app library simultaneously—avoiding the need to manually remove and switch out apps due to memory constraints.\nWhile the vast majority of these apps allow the wallet to hold additional cryptocurrencies and tokens, a handful impart additional functionality to the Nano X. For example, the FIDO U2F app turns the device into a two-factor authentication key, whereas the recovery check app can be used to ensure you have correctly saved your recovery phrase.\nMoreover, the Ledger Nano X is the first cryptocurrency hardware wallet to include a built-in 100mAH battery, a necessary upgrade since the device now features Bluetooth connectivity out of the box. This allows the device to connect to mobile devices wirelessly, whereas the older Ledger Nano S could only connect to mobile devices using a Ledger OTG Kit.\nWith the addition of wireless connectivity, increased memory, and a much larger screen, Ledger has clearly paid attention to the shortcomings of its earlier products and is trying to make safely storing crypto assets a less challenging task.\nThe Ledger Nano X is compatible with well over 1,000 digital assets, including 23 coins and all ERC-20 tokens. Many of these can be managed through Ledger Live, whereas some require the Ledger Nano X to be used in conjunction with a compatible wallet. Supported crypto assets include;\nThe Ledger Nano X supports practically every crypto asset supported by the Ledger Nano S, but is able to hold more of the relevant wallet apps at any one time thanks to its expanded internal memory.\nAs such, the Ledger Nano X is ideal for securing diverse portfolios, though individuals looking to store newly released crypto assets may need to wait until Ledger adds support for them.\nAs a hardware wallet, the Ledger Nano X targets the minority of cryptocurrency users that value security above all else. As such, the team behind the product has clearly put a great deal of thought into the potential ways such a device could be attacked, and have incorporated a huge number of potential safeguards into its design.\nLike all Ledger devices, the Nano X features state-of-the-art security and incorporates a physically isolated security element certified as CC EAL5+. These secure elements are similar to those used to secure credit and debit cards, and are the standard used by banks for the protection of financial information.\nThe device also features a dual-core MCU which runs a proprietary operating system known as BOLOS and controls communication between the connected device and the Ledger secure element.\nAlthough the addition of Bluetooth theoretically increases the number of potential entry points hackers could use to compromise the device, the Ledger Nano X encrypts Bluetooth traffic between the mobile device and requires manual verification for all important device actions.\nBeyond this, Ledger's Nano X and Nano S are the only hardware wallets to receive CSPN (First Level Security Certificate) certification, which means their security has been independently certified by ANSSI—the National Cybersecurity Agency of France.\nThese hardware-based security measures are also supplemented with several software-based ones, including a 4-8 digital security PIN, automatic inactivity lockouts and an optional Ledger Live password lock.\nOverall, the Ledger Nano X is without question one of the most secure cold storage solutions on the market.\nHowever, although its devices offer a high level of security, Ledger has experienced some security lapses as a company.\nIn June 2020, data from the company's e-commerce database was leaked, resulting in over a million customer records being posted to hacker forums. Some quarter of a million records included details such as physical addresses and phone numbers—exposing Ledger customers to the threat of phishing attacks and even threats.\nRecently, we shared news of a data dump. On December 23, we were alerted by our e-commerce provider Shopify about an incident in April & June '20 where their rogue team members exported merchants' customer databases. Ledger was included. More details: https://t.co/NHU3IbDL0a pic.twitter.com/DHQQ9arxCu\n— Ledger (@Ledger) January 13, 2021\n\nWhile Ledger has committed to changing how it handles customer data and identifying and prosecuting those responsible, it's an embarrassing lapse for a company whose business is the security of your crypto.\nThe Ledger Nano X is currently available for purchase from the official Ledger website for $119. With that said, it can often be found for cheaper at authorized third-party retailers as well as official resellers on Amazon. You should exercise caution when purchasing any hardware wallet, making sure to only purchase from authorized sources, and never using any hardware wallet that has already been configured.\nAt twice the price of the Ledger Nano S, the Nano X is one of the more expensive hardware wallets on the market. If portability and usability are your top concerns, it's probably worth the hit on your wallet—but if you're already happy with the Ledger Nano S, there's little reason to upgrade.\nThe addition of Bluetooth and massively expanded internal memory are steps in the right direction, whereas the huge range of supported cryptocurrencies means that even the most diverse cryptocurrency investors can secure their entire portfolio.\nThe Ledger Nano X is an excellent product marred only by its high price tag; those in the market for a less expensive alternative may want to take a look at the cheaper, but dated Ledger Nano S.\nRating: 4/5\n","create_date":"2021-02-26T18:15:27","tag":"ledger,hardware reviews,hardware wallet,hardware wallets,review,Reviews,bitcoin hardware wallet,best ethereum wallet,crypto hardware wallets","author":"Decrypt / Daniel Phillips"},

A bad year for Korean crypto just got worse.","title":"Bad news for Bithumb: Government slams Korean exchange with massive surprise tax - Decrypt","content":" Arguably the worst year for South Korea’s crypto exchange market just got even worse. The National Tax Service just told Bithumb, South Korea’s second biggest cryptocurrency trading platform, to pay $67 million in additional taxes.\nThe regulatory agency ordered Bithumb was to pay the extra tax to cover withdrawals it processed for foreign users, according to reports from local mainstream media outlets.\n“This is significant as Bithumb, like many other Korean exchanges, is suffering from loss right now. The exchange had a net loss of $180 million in 2018 according to an article by the Korea Times,” said Doo Wan Nam, an associate for South Korea business development at MakerDAO.\nThe National Tax Service said that Bithumb failed to withhold taxes from foreign users that traded on its platform. It argued Bithumb has to pay the $67 million first, and then it can ask its foreign users to pay taxes for their previous trades directly to the exchange.\nHowever, it’s functionally impossible for Bithumb to tax foreign users, who may or may not be based in South Korea. In response, Bithumb said it plans to take legal action to fight the request.\nThe controversy around the National Tax Service’s request is not about the amount, nor Bithumb itself. Instead, it centers around the lack of clear taxation policies and guidelines for both cryptocurrency exchanges and investors in South Korea.\nIndustry experts said that the tax agency cannot request additional tax payments when there is no regulatory framework in place to tax cryptocurrency trades in the first place.\nOne expert who asked for anonymity told Hankyung that if the National Tax Service “wants to impose taxes on cryptocurrency trading legally, the government of South Korea has to first make changes to the income tax law and give legal status to cryptocurrency.”\nMany local experts and industry executives agree that the request cannot be justified since it sets a bad precedent for the cryptocurrency sector.\nA bill outlining a regulatory framework aimed at cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers passed South Korea’s Parliamentary Affairs Committee on November 25. It’s awaiting final approval from the Congress. However, though the bill is considered to be a crucial step in the legalization process of cryptocurrencies in South Korea, it did not clarify taxation policy for local and foreign cryptocurrency investors.\n","create_date":"2019-12-28T17:46:53","tag":"korea,bithumb,crypto exchanges","author":"Decrypt / Joseph Young"},

There’s no getting away from it; to even get your hands on some crypto, you need to familiarize yourself with concepts like private keys and seed phrases, which can be a daunting prospect. And that’s before you even start navigating the waters of decentralized finance (DeFi). If crypto really is the future of currency, it needs to be as simple to use as regular currency.\nThat’s the future Argent is aiming for. It’s an Ethereum smartphone wallet that founder Itamar Lesuisse bills as the “simplest and safest place for your crypto.” To date, Argent has raised $16m in funding, releasing a closed beta with 5,000 loaded wallets holding an average of $2,000. A full public launch is planned in the coming weeks.\nArgent’s big innovation is to use smart contracts to replicate the features of a conventional banking app like Revolut. “We’ve abstracted all the complexity that comes with a noncustodial wallet,” Lesuisse explains. “So you don't have to backup a seed phrase, you don't have to worry about gas, you can use a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol like Compound in one tap.”\nWith crypto fraud and theft hitting $4.5 billion last year, Argent is also leaning heavily on user security; large transfers are delayed and subject to verification, while users can set daily transfer limits on their wallets.\nArgent’s unique approach to wallet security makes use of networks of trust. Users appoint “Guardians” to their account—which can include hardware wallets, MetaMask accounts, other Ethereum accounts held by trusted friends or family members, or Argent’s own two-factor authentication tool, Argent Guard. Significant actions, like verifying a large transaction or recovering a wallet, need the approval of one or more Guardians.\nWith seed phrases a thing of the past, here's the future:\nSocial recovery 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 - Use people you trust\nAnti-social recovery 🕵️‍♂️ - Use hardware wallets or MetaMask that only you control.\nWe got you covered for both. https://t.co/XMalNCuiGk\n— Argent (@argentHQ) January 24, 2020\n\nIt’s a nice idea, though in practice the challenge of finding close associates who are both crypto-savvy and sufficiently trustworthy to act as Guardians means that most people will probably resort to using Argent Guard or a hardware wallet as their Guardians.\nAt this week’s Ethereal Summit, Lesuisse will be taking to the virtual stage to discuss “Bringing DeFi to a billion people.” It’s a lofty ambition, and he freely admits that “Argent is only part of the solution.”\n“We’re starting to see pockets of users and areas where crypto solves problems, but I think we're at the very start of the journey,” says Lesuisse. “We see a lot of demand for stablecoins; there are entire regions that are very eager to move their money into dollars, and I think DeFi brings something very interesting there.”\nThe first stage in the process of bringing DeFi to a billion people was, as Lesuisse explains, “making [a wallet] simple, but in a way that’s secure and non custodial.” The next step was to bring DeFi “a tap away from the user.” For Argent, that meant integrating DeFi platforms like Compound and Maker’s Dai Savings Rate within the app. “It's easier to move money in Compound to Argent than it is to open a savings account with a high street bank in the UK,” Lesuisse says.\nOver 95% of Ethereum addresses have only used 1 DeFi protocol*.\nIt's time to change that.\nYou can now earn interest with @MakerDAO and @compoundfinance in just a few taps.\n🚀\n*(source: https://t.co/hg4047czAj) pic.twitter.com/Qba78SbSsi\n— Argent (@argentHQ) February 21, 2020\n\nThe next stage, and arguably the most important, is to scale DeFi. “To reach a billion, I think we need to acknowledge that not every person in the world should have something that looks and feels like Argent; we might not solve every problem for everyone,” Lesuisse concedes. He adds that DeFi is inherently built on network effects. “Often it's about liquidity and volume making it stronger and more useful for people,” he says. “That doesn't mean that it goes viral, and suddenly we have billions of people using it, obviously.”\nPayments and remittances will be a key driver of growth for DeFi, Lesuisse adds. He argues it’s unlikely that growth in DeFi will come from established markets. “It won’t happen straight away in the US or UK, or Europe, where payment networks are very advanced,” he says. “But I think there are markets where payment through crypto can provide a lot of value, and that’s an area that can grow quite quickly.”\nThe world is currently gripped by a financial crisis, with the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown shrinking economies and driving governments to unprecedented stimulus measures. For some crypto advocates, it’s a sign that cryptocurrencies’ moment in the sun has come, with widespread adoption sure to follow. Not necessarily, cautions Lesuisse.\n“I don't think we'll see some giant sudden mass adoption because of the financial crisis,” he says. “Some assets could move to crypto, because it might be an asset that can grow inside the situation. But I wouldn't call that mass adoption—that's talking about the minority of people who can afford to have savings and investments, not the majority.”\n“We do see a huge demand for the dollar,” he adds, “so I think that will increase with the current situation in some markets; we hear that mostly from markets like South America.” Ultimately, he argues, the financial crisis could help drive crypto adoption, “but I think in the end we as an ecosystem, as developers, need to build strong enough and compelling enough use cases.”\nWhy does DeFi matter?\n- Open to anyone, anywhere - You're in control - Transparent - And much, much easier to use 👇 pic.twitter.com/FWLcXc0S4P\n— Argent (@argentHQ) January 29, 2020\n\nThat means “generating value besides speculation,” Lesuisse says, adding that DeFi is still predominantly used by traders looking to leverage. “Lending with interest rate on the dollar is a bit more of a mass market use case; that's why we've been very bullish integrating it into Argent early on,” he says. “But overall the majority of DeFi is still mostly used by professionals, by traders. It's a good use case for them. It's just not yet a mass market use case.”\nThe majority of DeFi is still mostly used by professionals, by traders. It's not yet a mass market use case.\nWith Argent’s user base currently sitting at 5,000, versus the 515 million people worldwide who opened bank accounts between 2014 and 2017, there’s clearly plenty of room for growth. It is, Lesuisse says, “a very long journey” to mass adoption, and the ecosystem needs to work together to gradually add value. “We can’t just wait five or 10 years to delineate value, we need to find ways to add value to pockets of users on the way,” he says. “Expand that pocket bit by bit, rather than just reinvent the entire financial system over a 10 year period and hope that one day we turn it on and suddenly it works.”\n","create_date":"2020-05-06T11:34:09","tag":"Decentralized Finance,DeFi,ethereal,software wallets,Argent","author":"Decrypt / Stephen Graves"},

Anyone who runs an Ethereum node or mines ETH tokens should update their software client accordingly.\nThe Berlin upgrade will incorporate four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), made by users and integrated into the blockchain’s code by core developers. These include EIP-2565, which reduces some gas costs algorithmically, and EIP-2718, which is a wrapper allowing multiple transaction types on the blockchain.\nGet ready! The Berlin network upgrade is coming soon.\nSee the post below to learn more about what's included and how to upgrade to the latest clients.https://t.co/oDKvMz33lt\n— Ethereum (@ethereum) March 8, 2021\n\nTim Beiko, an Ethereum core developer, told Decrypt after this article was originally published that, in terms of EIP-2565, \"It means that the specific precompile which is affected by 2565 will be relatively cheaper gas-wise to execute, but if that's not the main source of demand for [transaction] fees (it's not), then it won't affect the overall gas prices.\"\nGas costs refer to how much it costs to execute a smart contract on the network, whereas gas prices, said Beiko, refer to \"how much ETH you are willing to pay per unit of gas.\" Transaction fees are a product of the two.\nThe other two EIPS to be included both come from Martin Swende and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. EIP-2929 actually increases gas costs in order to limit processing times and help block denial-of-service attacks. However, these increases are partially balanced out by EIP-2930, a proposal that also helps reduce the risk of broken smart contracts.\nWhat’s not included in Berlin is EIP-1559, the controversial proposal that will reduce the overall supply of ETH. At the moment, miners have some control of network fees, which are predominantly established via supply and demand; once EIP-1559 is incorporated into the blockchain’s software, the fees will be set by the network—then burned. Miners will continue to receive block rewards in the form of freshly minted ETH.\nSeveral mining pools aren’t happy about the change, which could eat into their profits. We have until July’s London hard fork to see whether its proponents are right, and that the change will serve to boost the price of ETH enough to placate the miners.\nEthereum transaction fees, which hummed along at under $4 for most of the blockchain network’s lifespan, began rising late into last year’s “DeFi Summer,” when interest in blockchain-based financial services exploded. On February 23 of this year, average transaction fees went above $38. They’ve since cooled down to around half that.\nThat is both bad and good news for the second-largest blockchain network. On the one hand, it indicates that developers are building atop the network and people are interested in the applications there. On the other, the fees mean that every transaction—from sending funds to bidding on NFTs—must be timed to coincide with lower congestion.\nEthereum 2.0, the proof-of-stake network that’s in development should solve the gas fee problem almost altogether by creating shard chains. By working like side streets, the chains will remove congestion and make the network faster. By extension, fees should decrease as infrastructural supply increases.\nBerlin won’t be as drastic an improvement, but it’ll be a start.\nEditor's note: This article has been updated.\n","create_date":"2021-04-15T10:07:30","tag":"Ethereum,Ethereum 2.0,berlin hard fork,Blockchain,Technology,vitalik buterin","author":"Decrypt / Jeff Benson"},

{"url":"https://decrypt.co/59224/why-does-coinbase-have-3-different-apps","web_url":"https://decrypt.co/","type":"article","description":"Crypto exchange Coinbase has three different apps, including two wallets and a trading app. Here's what they all do.","title":"Why Does Coinbase Have 3 Different Apps? - Decrypt","content":" San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase is one of the only regulated crypto offerings for US citizens and offers over ten products for both retail and institutional clients. But newcomers to Coinbase are usually left confused.\nWhile three of the firm’s retail products—Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Coinbase Wallet—may sound like they serve the same function, they actually cater to distinct audiences. This short guide tells you what each app does and who it's designed for.\nCoinbase's main app is known simply as \"Coinbase.\" It lets you buy a range of cryptocurrencies, store them in its in-built wallet and trade them for other coins. It is the main app for retail investors who want to buy small amounts of cryptocurrency. It's available both as a mobile app or as a web interface.\nThe app, however, is relatively expensive (particularly for small transactions). When buying or selling cryptocurrency, the app charges either a flat fee between $0.99 to $2.99 or a fee that varies depending on a number of factors, whichever is greater. On top of that, it charges a 0.5% spread on the sale. This is where you pay more for the cryptocurrency you're buying than the market rate—and Coinbase pockets the difference.\nSo, if you're buying $25 of cryptocurrency, you'll probably pay a fixed fee of $1.99 plus $0.12 in the spread—totalling $2.11, or around 8.4%.\nOn the other hand, the app is very easy to use and it has an excellent design. It's very simple to interact with and cuts out the confusing aspects of blockchain technology. It also has an Earn section where you can learn about the various coins it has on offer and get rewarded with some of those coins—making back some of those pesky fees.\nCoinbase Pro turns this crypto experience up a few notches. Unlike Coinbase's main app, this product is an advanced trading platform suitable for retail and institutional investors alike.\nCoinbase Pro lists over 43 cryptocurrencies over 125 trading pairs and the ability to view historical trading data and put on “limit” orders—a feature that allows users to specify exactly what price they want to buy or sell a coin at. There’s also an API key offered for algorithmic traders to build their own automated trading systems.\nPro has lower fees compared to Coinbase and is one of the world’s most liquid crypto exchanges. It is typically cheaper to send fiat money into Coinbase Pro and buy using its platform than it is to use Coinbase's main app. But, it's a bit more technical because you have to know how to make trades—and it's easy to make mistakes if you don't know what you're doing.\nYou can also send your funds between Coinbase's main app and Coinbase Pro very easily and for free. You simply go to deposit or withdraw funds, select your Coinbase amount and choose how much you want to transfer between them. This means you can buy cryptocurrency on Coinbase Pro and transfer it to Coinbase, if you want your funds to sit in the more user-friendly wallet.\nOver $9 billion worth of crypto traded on the exchange yesterday, as per markets tool CoinGecko, meaning users have a regulated, safe, and highly-liquid entryway into the crypto market.\nCoinbase Wallet is another wallet that does one thing differently. Instead of Coinbase looking after your cryptocurrency on your behalf, Coinbase Wallet lets you actually possess your own coins.\nThis is one of the cool things about cryptocurrency, you can actually own it—a bit like having dollars stuffed in your wallet. Every cryptocurrency is controlled by one thing, a private key, and this is a long string of alphanumeric digits that effectively act as your password, enabling you to spend your coins. You can also store this private key as a seed phrase, or a list of 12-24 words.\nThe good thing about this is it means you are in control of your own money, you look after it and you can do whatever you want with it. The drawbacks are that if you make a mistake, you could lose your money. For example, if you don't keep a safe record of your seed phrase and you lose your phone, you would lose your funds. So, there are risks.\nCoinbase Wallet lets you store Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as all ERC20 tokens (or tokens issued on Ethereum) and crypto-collectibles conforming to the ERC721 token standard (such as digital art or NFTs issued on Ethereum).\nSo there’s why Coinbase offers three retail-focused platforms. They are all entryways for new users into the burgeoning crypto market, but offer different products based on each user’s individual needs and privacy requirements.\n","create_date":"2021-02-24T09:50:14","tag":"holdings,fiat,bitcoin,coinbase,cash,crypto,coinbase pro,wallet","author":"Decrypt / Shaurya Malwa"},

But Bitcoin's one step ahead.","title":"Bitcoin beats gold as the most profitable investment of 2020 - Decrypt","content":" Bitcoin (BTC) has secured the position of most profitable investment of 2020, after eclipsing the performance of gold and oil, as well as major stock indices.\nSince the start of the year, Bitcoin has experienced some of its highest-ever volatility, which has seen its price fluctuate between a high of $10,446 on February 13 and a low of $4,111 on March 13. According to TradingView, the cryptocurrency also witnessed one of the most dramatic sell-offs in its decade-long history, crashing from $7,717 to $4,111 in a single day—equivalent to a 47% loss.\nDespite this volatility, Bitcoin has now managed to recover most of the value lost during its mid-March crash, and is now up 22.4% since the start of the year.\nGold, on the other hand, has also posted strong results so far in 2020. Starting the year at $1,529/oz, gold spiked to as high as $1,700/oz in early March, before collapsing to as low as $1,491 throughout mid-March. Since then, gold has recovered to its current value of $1,675/oz—equivalent to a gain of 9.5% YTD.\nAlthough both Bitcoin and gold witnessed a dramatic sell-off in mid-March after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a coronavirus pandemic, both are now trading at close to their pre-crash value. Comparatively, major US stock indices including the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and S&P 500 are still in the red following the crash, with DJI still down 15.7% YTD, while the S&P 500 is down 10.6% since the start of the year. Nonetheless, the S&P did manage to gain 12.7% in April alone, and appears to be showing strong signs of recovery.\nAs the world enters into a period of economic slowdown as a result of the movement controls instituted in most countries to tackle the coronavirus, several industries have been hit hard. Among these, few have been hit as hard as the crude oil industry, which saw shattering losses in the first four months of 2020.\nBack in April, futures contracts for West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) were trading at below zero due to a combination of extreme lack of demand and oversupply, forcing traders to pay buyers to take it off their hands. Although things have recovered somewhat since then, WTI oil's futures for June expiry are currently trading hands for just $18.59—compared to more than $60 for the June 2019 contract.\nLikewise, stocks in major oil firms like Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corporation have tanked this year, falling to their lowest value in more than a decade.\nBanking firms have been hit too by the coronavirus. As Decrypt reported, British bank HSBC reported a 50% fall in profits while Spain’s Santander suffered an 82% decline in quarterly net profit.\nDoes this mean Anthony Pompliano, partner at Morgan Creek Digital, was right?\nTips\nHave a news tip or inside information on a crypto, blockchain, or Web3 project?

It’s widely considered to be one of the most accessible too, as it allows users to purchase crypto using fiat currencies.\nFounded in San Francisco in 2012, Coinbase increased its assets under management from $35 billion in 2020 to $90 billion in 2021, and posted a Q1 2021 profit of $730-800 million. The exchange went public via a direct listing on the Nasdaq in April 2021, with shares trading under the COIN ticker.\nIn addition to its regular exchange the company also has a professional trading platform called Coinbase Pro (formerly known as GDAX).\nThe look and feel of a crypto exchange might seem like a strange thing to focus on, but exchanges with complicated or convoluted interfaces can be daunting enough that you’ll actually feel nervous about making costly errors.\nThankfully, Coinbase has an incredibly clean, easy-to-use interface that’s free from clutter and a breeze to navigate. Its dashboard shows you all the key information you’re likely to need at a glance such as your portfolio holdings, price charts and recent activity, with easy access to trading features, tools and account settings on the side.\nOverall, Coinbase’s interface is one of the main reasons other than fiat purchasing support that makes it a solid choice for crypto newcomers.\nCoinbase supports over 60 assets, though availability varies based on what territory you're in. It lists most of the big hitters, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Uniswap (UNI) and Cardano (ADA). After a lengthy wait, Dogecoin (DOGE) was finally listed on Coinbase in June 2021.\nThere are a few notable omissions, however. Following the SEC's $1.3 billion lawsuit against Ripple, Coinbase suspended trading of XRP on its platform, though users can still send and receive XRP from their account. Of the top 10 cryptocurrencies, Coinbase has also yet to list Polkadot (DOT) and (perhaps unsurprisingly) Binance Coin (BNB). Coinbase has also held off on listing privacy coin Monero (XMR), with CEO Brian Armstrong explaining that the exchange's hesitancy is down to conversations with regulators and internal risk assessments.\nOverall, Coinbase has a good selection of cryptocurrencies available, though its line-up pales in comparison to the range found on rival exchanges such as Binance.\nKicking things off with Coinbase is a straightforward experience. Naturally you’ll start by signing up with your name and email address, while setting up a password too. After verifying your address, you’ll need to provide your phone number to receive a verification code, which you then have to enter to proceed. These verification codes can then be sent to the same number in future for more secure logins.\nThe next step might seem scary to total newcomers as it involves proving your identification by providing state ID. In the US, that means you’ll have to share your social security number.\nRest assured that this is a normal process that’s just just like opening up any bank or investment account. Once that’s all done, congratulations—you’re the owner of your very own Coinbase account.\nThe next step is to add your bank account, credit, or debit card information to allow you to make deposits and withdrawals, for trading and/or investing. Again, this process is very easy and intuitive, and should pose no problems.\nYou can add your bank account by opening up your ‘Payment Methods’ page, and selecting ‘Link a New Account’, and choosing ‘Bank Account’. Select your bank, fill in your login credentials, and boom—your bank account is now linked to Coinbase. Adding a debit card is just as easy—just select to add a debit card, fill in the information, and you’re good to go. Note that credit cards are no longer supported.\nOnce you’re sorted on the bank account/card front, you can go to the ‘Buy’ section, browse for the crypto you’d like to buy, select your preferred payment method, confirm the details, and hit ‘Buy now’.\nEach purchase incurs a transaction fee (outlined in detail here), which may be higher than other exchanges. If you’ve bought $100 of Bitcoin, for example, your fee would be $2.99. Given how easy Coinbase is to use and set up, this could be viewed as an acceptable cost by beginners who have yet to broaden their trading experience.\nSelling is just as easy. Simply select the ‘Trade’ button, hit ‘Sell’, choose the crypto you want to sell, and sell it to your USD wallet. Select the wallet, choose ‘Withdraw’ and you can cash out the funds to your account too.\nSafety is never 100% guaranteed, but as crypto exchanges go, Coinbase is one of the safest options out there. It’s the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange and broker and is backed by trusted investors. The fact that it’s located in San Francisco (a highly regulated location) is another welcome bonus.\nTo date, the company has never experienced a hack, which is an impressive record, to say the least. Part of this robust security record is due to the fact that 98 percent of customer funds are stored offline in cold storage (aka disconnected from the Internet), protecting them from nefarious online thieves. In addition, drives and paper backups are distributed geographically in safe deposit boxes and vaults around the world.\nHaving said all that it’s worth noting that cash held in Coinbase wallets is FDIC insured up to $250,000. Crypto, however, isn’t insured, so unless you plan on day trading, you should always store your coins in an appropriate wallet after purchasing.\nWhile highly praised on the security front, Coinbase’s privacy track record is less impressive to those people who've been drawn to crypto on its promise of anonymity.\nThere’s no shortage of reports that claim that Coinbase tracks how its users spend Bitcoin. Indeed, the point was proved in May 2021, when the company provided information on a user's account to the FBI in response to a subpoena in a murder-for-hire case.\nCoinbase's acquisition of Neutrino—a blockchain-tracking startup—has done little to change the minds of privacy advocates.\nNeutrino is a company that focuses on analyzing blockchains with the goal of revealing the identity of address owners. Coupled with the news that Coinbase wants to sell its blockchain analytics software to the DEA and IRS, it’s clear to see why privacy alarm bells are (very loudly) ringing.\nWhen Coinbase works, it works very well. But when things go south, the exchange's customer service has been found wanting by some users. On the r/coinbase subreddit, there are a number of complaints from disgruntled users, who report being unable to access their accounts, having had their accounts locked, and waiting on slow responses from Coinbase Support.\nIn June 2021, a group of Coinbase users went so far as to file a class action lawsuit against the exchange, claiming that the company wrongfully locked them out of their accounts for several months. In response, a Coinbase spokesperson stated that, \"We take all customer concerns seriously. We are aware of the complaint and are reviewing the allegations, but we have no further comment at this time.\"\nDecrypt has some experience in this area. One writer's relative had their Coinbase account locked after being told they were \"ineligible\" to use the exchange; they were left unable to buy, sell, or move the cryptocurrency they'd purchased to an external wallet. Coinbase Support responded to inquiries stating that they were \"not able to provide specific details\" relating to the review process, and subsequently shut the support ticket after two months, without enabling the user to withdraw their purchased cryptocurrency.\nIn the end, the situation was only resolved when the writer contacted Coinbase's press office to flag up the issue (not an option available to most users). The account, Coinbase explained, had been suspended \"to protect against loss, because once funds are sent off our platform, we have no way to reverse those transactions.\"\nDuring this exciting time in the cryptoeconomy, we’re seeing a lot more people reaching out to Coinbase Support. This isn’t the ideal experience and we’d love to further explain what’s going on and how we’re committing to doing better. https://t.co/XvKtZe3B0N\n— Coinbase Support (@CoinbaseSupport) January 15, 2021\n\nTo its credit, Coinbase is aware of issues relating to customer support, and has committed to turning around delays in its response time, including expanding its support team and announcing plans to launch a chat function to enable users to communicate directly with Coinbase Support.\nLike many exchanges including Binance and Kraken, Coinbase has suffered from periods of downtime—frequently coinciding with periods of elevated price volatility in the crypto market.\nThe reason is likely down to surges in traffic placing extra load on the exchange, coupled with the fact that unlike traditional trading platforms, crypto exchanges are expected to operate 24/7—leaving limited opportunities to carry out maintenance on infrastructure.\nAccording to a January 2021 blog post, Coinbase has a number of fixes in the works to address downtime issues, including \"decomposing our monolithic application server into separate discrete services.\"\nHowever, Coinbase's efforts appear to have met with limited success; during the May 2021 market crash, Coinbase (along with other centralized exchanges) experienced \"intermittent downtime\" in the face of high trading volumes\nIf you're planning to take advantage of fluctuations in the market in order to trade, it remains best practice to keep your crypto in a wallet that you control, rather than on Coinbase (or any exchange). There are a number of possible options, including web wallets, mobile wallets (such as Coinbase's own Coinbase Wallet; see below) and hardware wallets.\nCoinbase Wallet is a standalone cryptocurrency wallet for iOS and Android that anyone can download, regardless of whether or not they have a Coinbase exchange account. It’s an alternative to other mobile wallet apps that let you store crypto, and the private key to your funds is held on the smartphone itself, putting you completely in control of your funds (unlike storing coins on an exchange).\nAs with the exchange, the Coinbase Wallet is easy and clear to use, letting you store, send and receive the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, ERC20 tokens and more, with the ability to back up your private keys to the cloud if you accidentally lose your recovery phrase. If you do happen to have a Coinbase account then you have the option to link it to your wallet to access your funds there too.\nCoinbase Pro is Coinbase's alternative exchange aimed at more experienced users, with more trading options. Despite being a separate exchange, users can still transfer funds between their regular and Pro Coinbase accounts.\nIn addition, Coinbase Pro actually offers lower fees than the regular Coinbase exchange while providing more options, albeit at the cost of a more intimidating interface.\nStarting today, Coinbase Pro customers in 23 US states can access up to 3x leverage on USD-quoted books. Trading crypto on margin (or leverage) can amplify the impact of your trades by allowing you to borrow additional funds. https://t.co/RZTiV0eUpf\n— Coinbase Pro (@CoinbasePro) February 12, 2020\n\nWhile Coinbase is simplistic in nature, Coinbase Pro has more mechanics when buying and selling, letting you choose your own market prices. This lets you, for example, set a buy price that’s lower than the higher Coinbase rate and more in line with the rest of the market, with lower fees to boot.\nIf you really want to sell without spending a little time setting up your buy and sell orders in this manner, you can always choose to sell at the market price, although that offers the same experience as the regular Coinbase exchange.\nLong story short? You’ll get a better deal using Coinbase Pro. Don’t be put off by the fancy interface and graphs which—while intimidating at first—actually don’t have a large part to play during simple, immediate transactions.\nIf you're a more experienced trader, check out our full review of Coinbase Pro.\nCoinbase also offers UK and some European residents the ability to sign up for Coinbase Card, a Visa Debit card that's linked to your Coinbase account. The card lets you spend any cryptocurrency stored in your Coinbase account, automatically converting crypto to fiat currency at the time of payment.\nCurrently, you can use the card to buy things in-store and online using any of the cryptocurrencies held in your Coinbase wallet, with contactless payments and Google Pay (although not Apple Pay) support to boot. With the option to earn back 4 percent in XLM or 1% back in BTC.\nCrypto, meet Coinbase Card. Now in the US you can spend the crypto in your Coinbase account everywhere Visa® debit cards are accepted and earn up to 4% back in crypto rewards. Terms apply. Join the waitlist today: https://t.co/Qg7LGDqrgn pic.twitter.com/DsbeX2Qm5o\n— Coinbase (@coinbase) October 28, 2020\n\nHowever, thanks to its high fees we’d say that this card is more of a novelty for now, and should be treated as a simple way to show people the potential of wider crypto adoption. With the US launch of the card announced in October 2020, US residents can now sign up for the Coinbase Card waiting list.\nCoinbase is one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges for a reason. It offers a very simple fiat entry point into the world of crypto trading, bolstered by a simple interface and sign-up process, not to mention an incredible security track record.\nThe price for this convenience, however, is a gray area surrounding its privacy practices, not to mention some of the highest transaction fees around.\nIn some ways, Coinbase has been a victim of its own success; its user base has grown so rapidly as a result of the recent crypto bull run that its infrastructure and customer support have struggled to keep pace with increased demand. Coinbase claims it's taking steps to remedy its deficiencies in these areas, and we'll check back to see how successful they've been.\nAnother consequence of its rapid growth is that it's accumulated a slightly confusing array of apps; to a newcomer, it's tricky to distinguish between Coinbase itself, Coinbase Pro, and Coinbase Wallet, though they offer very different services to very different audiences.\nCoinbase remains a solid exchange that we’d recommend to crypto first-timers looking to dip their toes into buying, holding and selling. Once you’ve gained some experience, though, it’s well worth exploring some of the other options out there, such as Gemini, Kraken and Binance.\nStar rating: 4/5\n","create_date":"2021-06-09T13:30:41","tag":"bitcoin exchange,coinbase,coinbase card,cryptocurrency exchange,crypto exchange,crypto exchange Coinbase,coinbase pro,coinbase wallet","author":"Decrypt / Esat Dedezade, Stephen Graves"},
{"url":"https://decrypt.co/22646/cobo-vault-wallet-review-impressive-security-comes-at-a-cost/","web_url":"https://decrypt.co/","type":"article","description":"Offering protection against both hacks and physical damage, the Cobo Vault strays from the status quo.","title":"Cobo Vault Wallet review: Impressive security comes at a cost - Decrypt","content":" In the more than six years that cryptocurrency hardware wallets have been around, the vast majority have iterated on the same formula.\nThey almost all feature a compact, minimalist design with two buttons for navigation, and include support for as many cryptocurrencies as possible. Most are designed to be relatively inexpensive and are constructed mostly from plastic.\nBut not the Cobo Vault.\nThis high-end cryptocurrency hardware wallet comes with a premium price tag to boot. At $479, the Cobo Vault is one of the most expensive hardware wallets on the market, but it does offer a no-compromises approach to not only security but also protection against physical damage to the device and its recovery phrase. Does its security warrant its price tag? Let's find out.\nThe Cobo Vault has arguably the best build quality out of any hardware wallet we have tested so far. The device is made from an aerospace-grade aluminum alloy and appears to have been constructed out of a single piece of metal, giving it a sturdy feel that indicates the device is robust enough to withstand the rigors of everyday use.\n\n\nAt 111.8mm x 64mm x 14.6mm, the Cobo Vault is one of the largest hardware wallets on the market, about the size of a small smartphone and weighing in at a somewhat hefty 190g. It's clear that Cobo isn't trying to compete with other devices in terms of portability, though the Vault is still small enough to carry around without too much hassle.\nAround the front, the Cobo Vault sports a 4-inch, 640 x 1136px LCD display, while the rear face features a built-in camera and can be removed to reveal a swappable 1,540mah battery. With only a single button used to power the device on and off, the Cobo Vault has a distinctly minimal and industrial aesthetic.\nThe Cobo Vault's packaging is as bulky as the device itself, with a reassuring heft to it and a tamperproof sticker sealing the contents. Inside, the Cobo Vault unit and its battery are packed separately in rigid foam compartments, with assorted other parts and tools tucked away beneath.\nUnlike the paper recovery sheets that come with most hardware wallets, the Cobo Vault ships with a Cobo Tablet metal wallet to store your 12-24 word recovery phrases, as well as letter blocks for each letter of the alphabet. You also get a protective case and charging dock, as well as a 1 meter Cobo-branded USB to USB-C cable.\nLastly, the box also contains a quick guide, warranty card, and mnemonic tablet instruction card, along with a small hexagon key, screwdriver, and replacement screws.\nGetting started with the Cobo Vault is a relatively simple process.\nFirst up, you need to create a new vault on the hardware wallet by generating and confirming a new 24-word mnemonic phrase. Once confirmed, the Cobo Vault will take around 15 seconds to generate the vault.\nThen it's simply a matter of selecting which cryptocurrencies you want to use with the device, after which you need to choose a 10-30 character password including upper and lowercase characters, digits and symbols. Finally, you have the option of adding an unlock pattern for additional security.\nThe next step is to scan your unique QR code in the Cobo Vault mobile app, which syncs the Cobo Vault wallet with the Cobo Vault app.\nDespite being one of the heftier hardware wallets on the market, the Cobo Vault is also one of the most usable. Thanks to its large color touchscreen, interacting with the device is a simple process, not unlike using an Android mobile device.\nUnlike most other popular hardware wallets, the Cobo Vault does not need to be connected to any other device in order to send payments. Instead, wallet users use the device camera to scan QR codes displayed on the associated Cobo Vault app to sign transactions. This is a slightly more involved process than with most other wallets, but it does increase the device's security.\nFurther boosting its security, the Cobo Vault has no input ports or wireless connectivity; instead, it's updated using a TransFlash (TF) card.\nThe Cobo Vault has an extremely simple setup process, but it can be a challenge to scan the QR code with the associated mobile app. However, once the device has been initialized, managing cryptocurrencies on the Cobo Vault using the hardware wallet and mobile app is a simple task.\nThe only downside is the Cobo Vault's relatively slow cold boot time of around 30-40 seconds, after which the device is pretty responsive.\nUnlike many cryptocurrency hardware wallets, the Cobo Vault doesn't offer a multitude of additional features. Instead, it keeps things basic and does one thing extremely well—keeping your cryptocurrencies secure.\nBecause of this, you won't find much additional functionality on the Cobo Vault. There's no Bluetooth, no FIDO U2F support and no USB connectivity—all things that competitors like the Ledger Nano X offer.\nHowever, the Cobo Vault does ship with a range of extras that make using the device simpler, safer and more convenient. For one, the device includes a stainless steel recovery phrase storage card known as the Cobo Tablet. This can be used to store the 24-word recovery phrase provided during setup, ensuring it remains safe should it ever be needed in the future. In addition, the Cobo Vault also ships with a protective case which Cobo claims is strong enough to withstand a tank driving over it.\nThe device is also IP68 rated, which means it can survive submersion in up to 1.5m of water for at least 30 minutes. The Cobo Vault is also one of the few hardware wallets to support multi-signature for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nThe Cobo Vault lags behind many other hardware wallets in terms of the number of crypto assets it supports. In total, customers can store 11 different cryptocurrencies on the device—including eight of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\nThe Cobo Vault currently supported the following cryptocurrencies;\nCustomers can also store Ethereum, Tron and EOS tokens on their device.\nAlthough the Cobo Vault currently supports less than a dozen cryptocurrencies, Cobo does release firmware updates several times per year—each of which generally adds support for one or more cryptocurrencies.\nThe Cobo Vault's USP is security, and Cobo really hasn't skimped in that regard. It's designed to keep the user's private keys safe from practically any conceivable threat. To help achieve this, Cobo has reduced potential attack surfaces down to an absolute minimum by forgoing Bluetooth and USB connectivity, protecting the Vault against man-in-the-middle and side-channel attacks.\nLike many other hardware wallets, including the Ledger Nano X and D'CENT Biometric Wallet, the foundation of the Cobo Vault's security is a secure element. Unlike other hardware wallets, the Cobo Vault's secure element is open source and has been graded FIPS 140-2 for security.\nAccess to the Cobo Vault is restricted by an up to 30 character long password and optional pattern code. Cobo Vault prevents the password from being brute-forced by adding an incrementally increasing lockout period, which delays subsequent password attempts.\nBeyond this, the Cobo Vault also includes a so-called \"self destruct\" function, which will automatically wipe the secure element if an attacker attempts to open the body of the device. Owners can also create additional hidden vaults on their devices by creating a unique passcode for each.\nThe Cobo Vault doesn't just provide security against attacks, it is also arguably the most physically durable cryptocurrency hardware wallet on the market today. The wallet is MIL-STD-810G certified for temperature and vibration resistance (among other things). It is also rated IK9 impact resistant, which means it can sustain survive an impact of 10 joules of impact force.\nThe Cobo Vault is among the safest hardware wallets available, thanks to its built-in secure element, tamper-proof design, and extreme damage resistance. It's also intuitive to use, despite its security protocols adding additional steps to the transaction signing process.\nHowever, this level of security comes at a steep cost—$479—and the Vault only supports a limited range of cryptocurrencies. As such, the device is suited to those who place a premium on security and are prepared to limit themselves to predominantly mainstream cryptocurrencies.\nIf you're prepared to pay the price for peace of mind, the Cobo Vault is an undeniably secure and simple way to store cryptocurrencies.\n","create_date":"2020-03-22T14:00:46","tag":"hardware wallet,Secure element,bitcoin,Cobo,Cobo Vault","author":"Decrypt / Daniel Phillips"},

Since the outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, it has infected over 17,000, and killed 361, as of Monday, February 3. Experts say it may be the next pandemic.\nFears over the virus—and how it might affect China’s economy—have hurt its stock market. China’s stock market fell by 8% today—its worst day since 2015.\nCoincidentally, the total amount the Chinese central bank is pumping into the economy is virtually the same as Bitcoin’s entire market cap, which is $170 billion, or 18 million Bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap.\nChina's central bank will inject the equivalent of 21,000,000 bitcoin into their markets tomorrow.\n1.2 trillion yuan = $174 billion = bitcoin's entire market cap\nEverything is fine. 🙃\n— Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) February 2, 2020\n\nSkeptics of central bank authority—some of whom are outspoken in the crypto community—regard large government injections of this ilk as reckless proof that financial control shouldn’t be ceded to governments. They note that Bitcoin’s monetary supply is fixed, with a maximum amount of Bitcoin ever to be created.\nIn December, the US’s Federal Reserve Bank pumped around $400 billion into the economy through “repos”—marketing repurchasing agreements—the same mechanism that the Chinese government is using this month.\n“This is 3x the entire Bitcoin market cap,” tweeted cryptocurrency analyst Ivan Liljeqvist at the time. ““EvEryThiNg’s fInE,” he said, mocking those who have faith in the government to sort out the economy.\n“Opt out of this crap, buy bitcoin,” tweeted one “John Bitcoin” at the time. Unsurprisingly, Mr., er, Bitcoin has already retweeted the China news.\nBut Chinese citizens won’t necessarily have a choice. China continues to ramp up development on its imminent digital currency and is cracking down on crypto businesses across the country. But with the ability to print their digital currency at will—and at little to no cost—will things only get worse?\n","create_date":"2020-02-03T14:26:43","tag":"Blockchain,china,crypto,coronavirus","author":"Decrypt / Decrypt Staff"},

Popular messaging app, Telegram is a primary target.","title":"Is Russia’s Internet ban an elaborate ploy to block Telegram? - Decrypt","content":" Russian lawmakers on Thursday approved a controversial bill to cut off the country's internet traffic from foreign servers and block popular messaging app, Telegram.\nThe legislation is designed to route all web traffic through Russian servers, enabling the government to control information and block messaging or other applications.\n“Telegram is the last remaining secure messenger available to Russians today and it’s been under assault from the government for the past year,” Mikhail Svetov, a spokesman for protest organizers the Russian Libertarian Party, told Decrypt.\nThe bill’s authors say its goal is to “ensure a stable, secure and seamless” internet, but it has raised fears that it will usher in a new era of widespread censorship.\nMoscow is, however, attempting to quash any debate of this kind. On Tuesday, Russian media deleted regulators’ comments that the bill will target popular messaging app, Telegram.\nAlexander Zharov, head of the Russian government's communications watchdog, told the state-run TASS news agency, that the bill “prevents the spread of banned information.”\nIt’s obvious that one of the elements of this prevention will be fighting against online resources, including the Telegram messaging app, Zharov said.\nBut, by Wednesday, at least four Russian media outlets (including TASS) had deleted the regulators’ comments, according to a Telegram channel that monitors efforts by Zharov’s department to block the messaging app.\nRussia’s main security agency, the FSB (a successor to the KGB) has branded Telegram the messenger of choice for “international terrorist organizations in Russia.”\nThe government’s first attempts to ban it, a year ago, resulted in entire sections of the web, online stores, services—even the Kremlin museum’s ticket sales—being inadvertently blocked. But the messaging app has adopted a clever system of changing IP addresses that currently outsmarts the government ban.\nMeanwhile, users have continued to access Telegram through VPNs, or virtual private networks, which have become increasingly popular.\nTelegram is insanely popular in Russia, where its encrypted technology makes it possible for people to communicate without government snooping, and for protest organizers to operate with impunity. As a result, the controversial internet bill’s first passage through the duma, the Russian Parliament, was met by the biggest demonstrations in Moscow since 2011.\nThe $1.7 billion messaging app was founded by Pavel Durov, the “Russian Mark Zuckerberg.” Durov made his name in 2007, developing Russia’s answer to Facebook, the Vkontakte (VK) social media network, which recently launched a digital currency.\nDurov was was forced to flee Russia and sell his VK stock after refusing to hand over the company’s encryption keys to security services, contravening a court order.\nHe founded Telegram while based in Dubai. Its token, GRAM, is keenly anticipated and trials are currently underway on the blockchain-based Telegram Open Network (TON) platform.\n\nTelegram was once even used by the Kremlin to communicate with the press.\n\nThe token is expected to be introduced by the autumn, but Russia’s Internet ban may well be effective before then.\nOnce signed into law, the internet bill will go into effect on Nov. 1. A third and final reading is expected early next week. If passed, only upper house approval, and President Vladimir Putin’s signature, stand between plans to cut off the country’s Internet from the outside world.\nThe date is auspicious: April 16, 2019, the anniversary of the government’s first attempt to block the Telegram app.\n","create_date":"2019-04-12T18:00:00","tag":"INTERNET,russia,Durov,Telegram","author":"Decrypt / Adriana Hamacher"},

(Don't worry: we'll tell you what \"da bing\" means, too.)]\nWhen Zhou Xiaochuan talks, people listen. The former—and longest-serving—governor of the People's Bank of China is an elder statesman and sort of like the country's Alan Greenspan. He gave a 30 minute talk in China Friday on “Digital Currency Challenges Global Financial Infrastructure and Management” which was a lot more exciting than its academic-sounding title.\nMany have interpreted Zhou's talk as another hint that China is about to issue its own state-bank digital currency. Such speculation might indeed be warranted given all the recent noise. But beyond evangelizing for PBoC’s digital currency, his speech also revealed the big-picture approach the PBoC is taking in designing its state-backed cryptocurrency.\nAccording to Zhou: The central bank-backed digital currency is not solving a technical problem so much as a coordination-management problem.\n\n\nFor instance, he cited international remittance as a place where users, local governments and exchanges are at odds. He said: “Many countries regulate capital outflow, many have issues with capital inflow, and in addition, when it comes to exchanges, there’s a global issue of coordination.”\nIn other words, whether it’s Facebook’s Libra or PBoC’s own digital currency, any crypto solution will inevitably face the challenge of people/country-coordination. Since that’s the case, Zhou concluded:\nFun unrelated fact: Before the ICO craze in 2017, Zhou publicly described bitcoin as an asset class. He also claimed that the government would not consider banning bitcoin.\nTop 3 other things that happened in China this week\n#1: Bitmain Drama: Starring Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan—with a special cameo appearance by the Amazing Dr.Yang!\nMicree Zhan, the co-founder, CTO and largest shareholder of multi-billion-dollar mining company Bitmain, was ousted in a coup by his co-founder Jihan Wu. After Wu took control of the steering wheel, Micree issued a statement on WeChat stating that he will retaliate via legal action.\nIn the midst of that drama, Bitmain filed in the U.S. for an IPO, on the heels of its next biggest competitor, Canaan Creative. (Both companies had tried to go public earlier but were forced to withdraw during the crypto crash.) As if this drama wasn’t complicated enough, on Friday, Dr.Zuoxing Yang—the brains behind Bitmain’s popular S9 mining rig, who left to be CEO of rival MicroBT, was arrested on charges of IP Theft.\nBehind the big screen, the drama revealed the real dilemma Bitmain faces. Micree insists on incorporating AI in its chip design, which could be the key differentiator Bitmain needs, as it faces competitors with better tech. But AI will add extra cost, and crypto prices have not yet fully recovered. Meanwhile, competitors such as Yang are slowing eating into Bitmain’s market share. Any wrong move could lead to the mining king being dethroned.\n#2: No more free lunch for Hong Kong's crypto exchanges\nIt’s time for crypto exchanges that benefited from Hong Kong’s lax financial regulations to wake up. The Securities & Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC) published new rules on Nov 6th that will govern exchanges via licenses and mandatory enrollment in a regulatory framework.\nWill it work—or drive the exchanges out of Hong Kong? According to Reuters, many exchanges welcome the idea, but few are making the move proactively. For smaller exchanges, the license means that they can’t operate with retail investors, which account for most of their revenue. Other requirements imposes extra overhead to their business model.\nThus far, OSL is the first and only—exchange to apply for the license.\n#3: BAT Race: who gets the blockchain greenfield?\nBAT ( Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) —the Big 3 tech companies of China—are officially in the race to develop and commercialize blockchain technology. At the recent World Blockchain Summit in Shanghai, (which almost got killed a few months ago due to the “winter market,” aka bear market), every big tech company gave a keynote speech about its blockchain strategy. Common themes included: Permissioned blockchains, trust-based society, financial inclusion and blockchain-based cloud infrastructure.\nHmmm, that sounds eerily like the same keywords from President Xi’s speech last week.\nDo you know? In China, the mere mention of “bitcoin” online can attract unwanted attention from censors. So crypto insiders have come up with a darling nickname, which stems from the fact that the digital currency is typically depicted in photos as an orange-ish, round coin: da bing (大饼). That means “big pancake” in Mandarin.\n","create_date":"2019-11-09T16:00:52","tag":"president xi,bank of china,bitcoin,cryptocurrency,da bing,大饼","author":"Decrypt / Shuyao Kong"},

And “farming it” has yielded annual returns of 1,000% for some traders.\nWe’re talking about yEarn’s YFI token. yEarn (previously called iEarn) is a yield aggregator that redirects users’ deposits to lending markets offering the best rates. Four days ago, yEarn founder Andre Cronje launched YFI, its governance token, to cede control over their many products to users “mostly because we are lazy,” the team said in a blog post.\nWhatever the reason, in practice, the token distribution puts the entirety of the protocol in the hands of the community right out of the gate, unlike other projects where teams keep the majority of voting power.

Three days after the token distribution started, this is exactly what they did: deposits soared by more than $150M to over $280M.\nWhile governance is ruled by token holders, until a few hours ago, control over YFI was not. After millions flowed into yEarn pools, Ethereum community members were quick to point out that the admin keys in control of YFI issuance rest in the hands of Cronje, meaning he *could* have minted infinite tokens and drain the DAI/YFI pool containing over $60M in value.\nThis was fixed last night by putting control of YFI in a multi-signature wallet, which requires 6 out of 9 participants to agree on changes. Cronje is not a member of the multisig. (Disclosure: I am one of the signatories).\nSo what’s so great about YFI that traders are pouring over their crypto to get it? The yEarn team said it’s worthless:\n“We have released YFI, a completely valueless 0 supply token. We re-iterate, it has 0 financial value. There is no pre-mine, there is no sale, no you cannot buy it, no, it won’t be on uniswap, no, there won’t be an auction. We don’t have any of it.”\nThat statement is a tongue-in-cheek way to highlight that the token can only be earned by using the yEarn platform. It has a total supply of 30,000 which will be distributed to stakers in the platform’s liquidity pools. There is no separate stash for investors in the project, and it wasn’t sold in an “initial dex offering” like many other DeFi tokens.\nHere’s a quick look at the first two Pools which went live when YFI was announced:\nyEarn - Stake yCurve LP tokens to earn YFI\nBalancer - Stake Balancer LP tokens for this DAI/YFI pool to earn YFI\nSince then, two new pools have been announced, pushing composability to its limits:\nMeta Governance - Stake Balancer LP tokens for this yCurve/YFI pool to earn YFI and governance rights\nFee Rewards - Vote on a governance proposal and stake at least 1000 BPT tokens in the Governance pool to have a claim on yEarn’s ~$50k/wk trading fees.\nFor anyone wondering why the hell anyone would be interested in these convoluted positions, look no further than the outrageous APYs currently being offered. At its peak price of just over $2000/YFI, LP’s were looking at APYs north of 1,000% on any of the aforementioned pools.\n.@iearnfinance $YFI yield farming 👨‍🌾\nStaking @CurveFinance yCRV pool: 831% APY\nStaking @BalancerLabs YFI-DAI pool: 1830% APY\nStaking @BalancerLabs YFI-yCRV pool: 1571% APY\nShout out to @Weeb_Mcgee for creating https://t.co/VP78sVTr0W, thanks fren https://t.co/IpxvSxhEHc pic.twitter.com/rVMMDEKInT\n— ChainLinkGod.eth (@ChainLinkGod) July 19, 2020\n\nThese returns are the short-term result of the rapid spike in demand. Still, yEarn has consistently delivered annual returns of about 10% for it’s yearn.finance lending pool - a contract which autonomously shifts between Compound, Aave and dYdX based on which has the highest return.\nNow, so much money is flowing into the platform’s liquidity pool on the Curve DEX (called yCurve), that the stablecoin aggregator is now the second-largest DEX by trading volume, with volume peaking at $87M on Sunday.\n$78M daily trading volume, $168M TVL. That's our ATH metrics so far!\nJust to sink that in. Daily trading volume is higher than Kraken's today, and half of Coinbase's pic.twitter.com/HXbNi4j4Pc\n— Curve (@CurveFinance) July 19, 2020\n\nAs if 1,000% APY wasn’t exciting enough, YFI’s first governance poll has also intrigued yield farmers.\nProposal 0 decides whether the YFI supply should be capped at 30,000 in perpetuity or if the protocol should retain the ability to mint additional YFI tokens in the future as new pools come into play.\nWith 3x more votes in favor of “Against” it looks like YFI will in fact be capped, opening a pandora’s box regarding sustainability for DeFi’s hottest new governance token.\nTo corral the discussion around governance, the community has launched both an official governance forum and a Discord channel to discuss all things yEarn.\nhttps://medium.com/iearn/yearn-governance-forum-7b7c9d0300ac\nWhile the contracts used for YFI staking were forked directly from Synethix’s audited contracts, the YFI ones have not been audited after they were adapted to suit the needs of yEarn governance. Cronje is known for deploying code which hasn’t been audited —he even says so on his Twitter bio which reads “I test in prod.”\nThese contracts are now in review by Samczsun and a group of security auditors who form the group Audit DAO.\n1/3 In April, $SNX started doing incentivized pools. Specifically for the https://t.co/9AFGLyMg3y x sUSD pool.\nThis is the contract 0xDCB6A51eA3CA5d3Fd898Fd6564757c7aAeC3ca92\nIt is built by @k06a\nIt is the best IDO/ICO/IEO/I-LOL-O out there, and it works 100%\n— Andre Cronje (@AndreCronjeTech) July 20, 2020\n\nThe premise of a truly community-owned yield farming token is as exciting as it is scary. This experiment around truly decentralized governance is one that has us at the edge of our seats.\n—By Cooper Turley\n[This story was written and edited by our friends at The Defiant, and also appeared in its daily email.

Wyoming makes its case to become the new home for all your blockchain and crypto startup needs.","title":"How Wyoming is winning the blockchain West - Decrypt","content":" Home on the range, where the deer and the tokenized assets play.\nWyoming, of all places, is creating a regulatory environment for digital assets that could make it the Malta of 'Merica. A slew of bills passed there during the past year are transforming it into the go-to place for crypto startups—the latest specifically aimed at companies and investors looking to use digital assets to borrow money and finance new ventures.\nThe net result of the “Digital assets-existing law” bill—introduced by the Wyoming Senate last Friday—would be to establish a custody and lending regime for tokenized digital assets unlike anything currently available anywhere in the country.\nFor starters, the bill seeks to classify digital assets into three categories—a digital security (investment contracts), a digital consumer asset (utility tokens), and virtual currencies (bitcoin, ether, and the like)—and define property rights for each. The bill would also allow banks, rather than just financial institutions and trust companies, to function as “qualified custodians” for digital assets.\nBy providing both banks and their customers with clear rules regarding digital-asset custody and property rights, Wyoming would position itself as the premier location for coin lending services, as Caitlin Long—an advisor to the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition and former president and chair of Symbion—notes on Twitter.\n19/ So, if you must use a custodian, use a #Wyoming custodian--nowhere else will your property rights in digital assets be better protected. STAY AWAY from NY especially, bc NY permits #rehypothecation & allows failures to deliver. WY protects investor rights better than NY does!\n— Caitlin Long 🔑 (@CaitlinLong_) January 18, 2019\n\n“In practice, this could lead to much greater use of digital assets as collateral in lending arrangements, since lenders now have a clear roadmap for perfecting their liens on digital assets,” says Gabriel Shapiro, an attorney with the blockchain-focused DLx Law LLP. That’s a pretty big deal, but the Cowboy State wants more.\nLast week, the Wyoming House of Representatives put forth a bill (HB185) that aims to give corporations the ability to issue tokenized stock certificates. Shapiro calls it a “game changer,” adding that if the bill is passed, “it will make it easier for companies and investors to start harnessing the power of public blockchains for traditional stock ownership.”\nI love this!\nThis is so cool it needs an epic theme song.\nMaybe the Lord of the Rings theme: “Dunnnnn...dun dun dun...dun dun Dun!!”\n🍿 🚀 ❤️ 📝\nWith a blockchain replacing a 3rd party ledger, stocks can be on your phone, global and tradable in Bitcoin or fiat.\nThat’s huge. https://t.co/UmZwcsFNo8\n— Bruce Fenton (@brucefenton) January 17, 2019\n\nThe attorney explains that certificated stock in the form of digital tokens would best suit the needs of a corporation that wanted to give stockholders “more freedom” with regard to transferring their shares or using them as collateral in other transactions, without the corporation needing to authorize or even being aware of those transactions.\n“With token certificates, you could even do pretty exotic things like cross-chain atomic swaps where a given corporation has some of its float on, say, Ethereum and some of its float on Ravencoin or a plasma chain,” he says.\nAs if all this wasn't enough to attract crypto startups to the state, the “Financial Technology Sandbox” bill would give blockchain startups their own regulatory playground to test new products and technologies. Unanimously passed by the state’s House Committee on Minerals, Business and Economic Development on January 11, the bill would give companies the ability to seek waivers from the state to exempt them from certain rules for limited periods.\nMoves like this could very well be the reason that companies like Cardano are making the jump to Wyoming. Heck, even ConsenSys (Decrypt’s financier) might incorporate an entity or two in the state, according to the company’s general counsel Matt Corva:\nWe have a pipeline of new business incorporations @ConsenSys coming in Q1. Getting \"consensus\" on having at least some of those be in Wyoming to take advantage of the new laws and support THE leading state in blockchain business friendly innovation. Congrats! cc: @PatBerarducci\n— Matt Corva (@MattCorva) January 17, 2019\n\nShapiro says he’s “amazed” by Wyoming’s innovative path: “Before 2018, it never would’ve crossed my mind to advise a client to seriously consider incorporating in Wyoming, but for companies whose businesses are built around digital assets, Wyoming has become a very serious competitor to Delaware,” he says.\nJack Tatar, coauthor of Crypoassets, is similarly impressed with Wyoming’s progress, though worries that it will ultimately have “little impact” until clear rules are established at the federal level.\nWhile Tatar believes other states should also consider implementing similar “sandbox” environments for startups, he says that what investors really need is “federal regulatory clarity” for how to “effectively raise funds and target an exit strategy.”\nNevertheless, these bills could place Wyoming in a strong position relative to other U.S. jurisdictions and help the state “be seen as the new home for American crypto company creation,” he says. Wyoming, a crypto hub of conferences, innovation centers, and think tanks? “I can ride a horse and would be open to helping out,” says Tatar.\nIndeed, Wyoming may end up leading other state and federal regulators to water, but will they drink?\n","create_date":"2019-01-22T13:00:09","tag":"INTERNET,investing,government,finance,ENTREPRENEURSHIP,politics,Markets,Blockchain,business,Technology","author":"Decrypt / Guillermo Jimenez"},

It will then use that edge to gain greater control over its economics—as China President Xi Jinping highlighted in his speech on blockchain. That will help China to continue growing while positioning the Renminbi in a position to become the global reserve currency.\nAnd who’s most helping these efforts? The President of the United States, she claimed.\n“Trump is going to make China great again,” Wan said, onstage. “A lot of the policy Trump has pushed out has become a forcing function for China to accelerate this internal development and economic and political reform.”\nWan said that the issue really kicked off on October 23, two days before Xi’s speech on blockchain. On that day, Mark Zuckerberg, told Congress: “If America doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.”\nHis comments were later echoed by Xi, who said blockchain technology is important for economic freedom, and suggested that China should take the lead on it. “I don’t think it was a direct response, but the timing was very interesting,” Wan said yesterday.\nWan noted how unusual it was for Xi to make such a strong speech at that particular meeting. “This is a very important [Communist Party of China] internal meeting. Normally they would talk about state planning, strategy—things like that,” she said.\nShe pointed out that Xi didn’t mention Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, focusing instead on blockchain technology. She said this was unsurprising, given that China has always been fixated on infrastructure investment, from high-speed rail to metropolitan infrastructure.\n“Now for the last three decades, China’s GDP has been growing at 10% every year. [Xi] has to think about the next growth potential, the next growth topic. He handpicked three main technology infrastructures: AI, 5G—and blockchain,” she said.\nAt the same time, his speech also prepared the country for the digital Renminbi, she added.\nThe digital Renminbi is where it gets really interesting for China. “China has a huge problem: Its shadow banking industry, worth $10 trillion,” she said, noting that there are two benefits to having a digital Renminbi. First, it could provide visibility—and help to crack down—on this shadow banking industry, by restoring control of the money supply to the People's Bank of China. Second, it could allow China to program the new digital Renminbi to flow into a certain market sector, thereby exercising iron-clad, precision control over monetary policy.\n“Right now, we are in this fractional banking reserve system. They can only have an indirect impact on monetary policy. But what if they can program it? That would be extremely powerful,” she said.\nWan pointed out that the US has been on the fence about cryptocurrency and largely dismissed the idea of launching its own digital fiat. By contrast, China is leading the way, which could boost its global financial dominance. “China could help other countries build their own digital fiat,” Wan said. “This would further get rid of the US dollar dominance and help to boost Renminbi global liquidity.”\nThat could lead to a greater divide between East and West.\n“The new version of this cold war is not going to be a space race, it’s going to be an economic race. There’s going to be a huge partition. We have seen [how] the Internet has been partitioned. China has this great firewall and the US doesn’t know what’s going on in China. Chinese citizens don’t know what’s going on outside,” she said, adding, “There will be this currency partition too.”\nShe noted that China is racing ahead with its ambitious currency plan. The country is well on its way to becoming a cashless state—even beggars use QR codes, she claimed. The majority of all payments are made through mobile apps, such as WeChat Pay or Alipay. “It makes things much easier for the central government to roll out this digital Renminbi.”\nThe wild card in all this, however, is Bitcoin, Wan said. While the digital Renminbi is, “trying to gain market share, awareness and win over... Bitcoin, Bitcoin is the money of the people.”\nShe concluded, “Bitcoin is the red pill, digital fiat is the blue pill. [The] choice is on us.”\n","create_date":"2019-11-13T15:00:37","tag":"Donald Trump,digital money,bitcoin,china,trade war","author":"Decrypt / Tim Copeland"},

Telegram is changing the world. And it may yet beat Facebook to the ultimate prize.","title":"Telegram fever: the crypto messenger shaking up the world - Decrypt","content":" In Uzbekistan, it’s even spawned a new form of farewell; Uzbeki users of the popular messaging app, Telegram now say Telegramlashamiz—call you soon.\nThroughout the world, people are turning to Telegram, whether as a result of outages by rival Facebook, a desire to evade the authorities or simply because it’s a more cost-effective alternative to mobile messaging.\nThe app’s encrypted technology, which makes it possible for people to communicate without government snooping, has helped it amass a 200 million-plus user base. And, in Russia and Iran, countries that have tried to outlaw it (citing fears of terrorism and unrest,) users have not only circumvented a 2018 ban, but redoubled their efforts to get up the authorities’ nose.\nOn Thursday, ZDNet reported that a Telegram user leaked hacking tools used by Iran’s elite cyber-espionage unit on the messaging app, and doxed Iranian Ministry of Intelligence officers, posting the officers’ phone numbers, pictures and names.\nUnder the alias “Dookhtegan,” the user threatened the authorities with further exposure— and warned that he or she would wipe servers clean.\nIt’s no accident that Persian-language channels dominate the list of Telegram’s most popular public channels, despite a ban that’s been in place in Iran for almost a year.\nUsers circumvent the ban by using Virtual Private Networks (VPN’s.) Telegram’s encryption and robust support for Farsi has attracted 40 million users—nearly half the country's population.\n\n\nThe app allows users to send private messages to contacts, create private groups of up to 200,000 members and public channels that can be accessed by anyone who’s downloaded the app.\nBut there are now signs that government agencies, including state-run TV and the presidency's press office, are quietly returning to Telegram.\nPartly, that’s to do with its effectiveness in disseminating information during devastating floods that hit Iran in March and April, while Iranian state TV was criticized for failing to report on the floods and broadcasting exaggerated accounts of official aid to victims. Nevertheless, it’s unlikely that the courts will reverse the ban, despite high-ranking officials, including the president, speaking out against a failed censorship policy.\nIn Russia, when authorities first sought to ban the app citing security concerns, widespread protests ensued.\nRussians swiftly learned to use VPN’s to bypass the ban and, activists say that Telegram is used by pretty much everyone in Russia. Pavel Durov, the Russian exile who founded the app, is revered.\nThe government is now taking extreme measures to block the app; it’s threatening to “unplug” Russia from the Internet do so. Protest organizer, Mihail Svetov, told Decrypt (via Telegram!) that the controversial bill to cut off Russia’s Internet traffic from foreign servers is an attempt to trounce the messaging app for good: “Their inability to block Telegram last year is what convinced them to put the Internet under even tighter control,” he said.\nBut Durov has been “pro-active in resisting censorship and created a clever system of changing IP addresses that currently outsmarts the government ban,” says Svetov.\n“Telegram is the last remaining secure messenger available to Russians today.”\nOnce signed into law, the Internet bill will go into effect on Nov. 1, enabling the government to control information and block messaging or other applications. But, until then, the app is helping activists to organize protests against the new law.\nRussia and Iran are not the only countries attempting (and failing) to block Telegram. A user on Reddit’s privacy channel lists Bahrain, China, Indonesia and Pakistan as countries where the app is at least partially restricted..\nIndia my soon join them. A major government initiative is clamping down on social media, which it blames for spreading fake news. Facebook-owned platform WhatsApp, has already been banned, when it was deemed responsible for false rumors that went viral and led to a string of mob lynchings.\nIn Uzbekistan, Telegram is freely available and more popular than the Internet itself. Telegram’s Uzbek-language channels are eclipsed in number only by Persian ones.\nIn India, the availability of low-cost smartphones, along with a significant drop in the price of data plans in recent years, has made messaging apps popular. But analysts warn that the deeply intertwined religious and political beliefs—which make the country especially sensitive to rumors—are a veritable tinderbox when paired with social media.\nIn Uzbekistan, meanwhile, Telegram is freely available and more popular than the Internet itself. It’s the second-most downloaded application on iOS, after Instagram, and on Android after Shareit (an app to enable cross-platform sharing). Telegram’s Uzbek-language channels are eclipsed in number only by Persian ones.\nUzbeki’s use Telegram a forum for news, views and business activity. It’s instrumental in aiding the nation’s best-loved bloggers to expand audiences and monetise content, on a par to YouTube’s success in America and Europe. Uzbek companies, such as mobile operator Ucell, run advertising on Telegram and virtual shops are springing up on the network.\nBut Telegram has also become a forum for unprecedented levels of political discussion, following the easing of restrictions on free speech after the death of long-ruling leader Islam Karimov in 2016. Telegram has helped to expose the controversial activities of local and national government officials.\nIn 2017, for instance, as punishment for a poor harvest, farmers were made to stand in a ditch in front of officials, including the deputy prime minister. The images went viral, resulting in the removal of the deputy from his post.\nBut in neighbouring Kazakhstan, while popular, Telegram is not quite as effective.\nThere, the government is borrowing from the playbook of authoritarian peers like Russia and Iran and cracking down on dissidents using Telegram to discuss politics, with some success.\nThe content of incriminating discussions can be as nebulous as insinuating that the president is guilty of nepotism.\n“If you have Telegram on your phone, you are already a suspect,” activist Batyr Abayuli told news outlet, Eurasianet back in August.\nIn Kazakhstan, it seems, Telegram’s end-to-end encryption—while allowing for confidentiality—doesn’t prevent dissident groups from being infiltrated by security services. Perhaps Telegram’s newly-introduced message delete function will be helpful.\nIn Israel, the 27 people currently facing charges of involvement in a mass cannabis distribution network on Telegram, would likely agree.\nIndictments were filed on Thursday against those involved in the operation, which was dubbed “Telegrass.”\nAccording to the indictment, the network’s managers hid their revenue by using cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, and pocketed $8 million during the two years Telegrass was in operation.\nPolice said their efforts to break the criminal ring finally succeeded after an agent, who worked for the network, gathered evidence, according to Israel’s Channel 13.\nIt’s unclear whether Telegrass was a private or public channel. But Telegram, which is headquartered in the UK, reserves the right to take down public channels and has done so in the past.\nIn 2017, after Indonesia partially blocked access to the app in answer to the increasing number of public channels launched by extremist groups, the messaging app removed all terrorism-related public channels reported by the Indonesian government.\nSolutions to combat the spread of disinformation have also been put forward, including “fact-checking Telegram bots,” proposed by the BBC innovation department, News Labs. Essentially, a bot can be invited into private Telegram chats and can establish whether or not messages or articles posted in the chat are trustworthy.\nTelegram also has plenty of innovation in the works. It plans to release its GRAM cryptocurrency by October (at the latest) and to launch the Telegram Open Network (TON), a blockchain platform for the development and deployment of dapps, to rival Ethereum and EOS.\nTelegram has created a ready user base of prospective cryptocurrency users; a rapidly expanding network, seemingly immune to government interference (but not infiltration.)

Decrypt spoke to analysts to understand why.\nPer the upgrade, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, the Ethereum blockchain would use Ethereum transaction fees to buy ETH on the open market and then destroy it, reducing ETH’s overall supply.\n“It’s like a company that earns a profit and buys back shares,” Tim Ogilvie, CEO of Staked, an Ethereum infrastructure services company, told Decrypt.\nBurning billions of dollars in ETH could pump up the price of ETH, he said. “The net effect is that the remaining shares increase in value because the supply is smaller.”\n“It's extremely bullish,” said Ogilvie.\nHe estimates that at ETH’s current market cap, close to $200bn, the network would burn 1-4% of the supply each year. “If you like BTC’s hard cap at 21 million tokens, you’ll love ETHs declining supply.\"\nImplementing EIP-1559 would also introduce a set fee for processing Ethereum transactions, replacing the current auction-style market that confronts users with ever-changing transaction fees.\nThe hope is that introducing a set fee would stop miners from manipulating transaction fees that extract large amounts of money from users, making fees less volatile. That would be a godsend for users that this week had to pay, on average, fees of over $20 per transaction.\nInstead of buyers and sellers setting fees, the network would automatically generate a “BASEFEE” price in line with network activity. If the network is busy, the BASEFEE would go up. If the network is quiet, the BASEFEE would go down. Users could still tip miners extra money to process transactions, but it’s not necessary.\nThe Ethereum network would use the money raised from the BASEFEE to buy, and then burn, ETH.\nOne of the most exciting features of EIP1559 is the BASEFEE opcode\nIt will allow smart contracts to estimate congestion (by comparing historical basefee behavior) and programmatically adjust parameters such as dispute periods in optimistic rollupshttps://t.co/fLBUmUQKeY\n— Georgios Konstantopoulos (@gakonst) January 25, 2021\n\nOgilvie doesn’t expect that the proposal will immediately solve the problem of high transaction fees.\nBut he said it would make it easier for financial analysts to value ETH, who could be sure that the amount of money paid in fees isn’t manipulated or prone to volatility—encouraging investors into the network.\nEric Wall, CIO of crypto fund manager Arcane Assets, also thinks that EIP-1559 is bullish. “I think this is one of the most important proposals for the long-term health of Ethereum, on par with the move to proof-of-stake,” he told Decrypt.\nIf the potential for EIP-1559 is self-evident, why hasn’t it been adopted yet?\nOne reason: it’s not ready yet. “There’s still one outstanding [cyber security] risk issue with EIP-1559 that needs to be addressed,” Wall told Decrypt. “After that is fixed and it gains approval, it needs to get included in the next Ethereum hard fork, which would be sometime later this year—summer, perhaps.”\nI think it should be \"ready to be considered for mainnet\" in the next few weeks. See this checklist for what's left to do: https://t.co/l2kEfwgNZs\nWe want to get the \"Client Level Open Issues\" done before we present it on AllCoreDevs.\n— Tim Beiko | timbeiko.eth (@TimBeiko) February 6, 2021\n\nAnd the proposal faces staunch resistance from Ethereum miners, Ogilvie told Decrypt. “Miners are naturally resistant as this will transfer a portion of fee revenue from miners to holders of ETH,” he said—burning Ethereum could increase its price; that would be good for HODLers but it would do nothing for miners.\nStill, many are excited about the forthcoming EIP-1559 implementation. “And that excitement alone increases the price,” said Wall.\nDisclaimer\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.\n","create_date":"2021-02-07T15:22:18","tag":"Grayscale,eric wall,EIP-1559,Ethereum,Ethereum Improvement Proposal,Breaking Push,tim Ogilvie","author":"Decrypt / Ekin Genç"},

It showed that far more sensitive data had been stolen, with Ledger estimating that a portion of 270,000 users have had their names, delivery addresses and telephone numbers posted online. And yet, the firm won’t be providing any compensation.\n“When you have a data breach of this magnitude for such a small company, we won’t reimburse for a million users, all the devices, that’s just not possible. It would just kill the company,” Gauthier told Decrypt, adding, “Instead we prefer to look at the future. What Ledger is doing right now is investing a lot of time and money building the next layer of security and the next products that will bring more security to our users.”\nToday we were alerted to the dump of the contents of a Ledger customer database on Raidforum. We are still confirming, but early signs tell us that this indeed could be the contents of our e-commerce database from June, 2020.\n— Ledger (@Ledger) December 20, 2020\n\nAs Decrypt reported, the release of more sensitive data has resulted in upgraded phishing attacks. Before, emails were asking Ledger users to download malicious links, hoping to get their private keys to their cryptocurrencies. Now, these emails are telling Ledger’s customers that they know their name and address and are threatening to come to their houses to steal their cryptocurrency unless they pay a ransom.\n“It’s just an online scam to scare you with these tactics. This is what works for attackers. To actually move to someone’s home is a very costly event.” said Gauthier.\nWouldn't want to be a Ledger customer right now 👇 pic.twitter.com/wZoH3OwTLL\n— Riku Raisanen (@rikuraisanen) December 21, 2020\n\nBut he argued that it’s unlikely that these threats are real.\n“Even though it’s a possibility and we don’t deny it’s a possibility, it’s not the highest possibility that this will happen. The database has been out since June and no-one has [ever] reported any attack of this sort.”\nGauthier argued that scammers will try to spend as little money as possible and such phishing attacks enable them to easily target a high number of customers online—without the risks of attacking them in person.\nGauthier said that his customers should not move house to avoid physical attacks. He said that users should not be storing private keys in their own homes, especially when it comes to storing large amounts of cryptocurrency.\n“Would you keep a million dollar in cash at home? If you have that much wealth, you shouldn’t keep it in your house,” he said. Ledger recommends that users store their private keys in a secure location where nobody else has access.\nHe may not have been attacked at his own home, but Casa CTO Jameson Lopp knows a thing or two about personal safety. In 2017, he was SWATted at his house. Afterward, he spent a lot of time and energy moving to a place unknown and keeping his location private. He even spent $5,000 on personal detectives to see if they could track him down (they couldn’t). And as CTO of Bitcoin storage provider Casa, he knows a thing or two about security.\n“[The hack] was inevitable. Fundamentally information wants to be free. This is a recurring theme that you see across any service that stores large amounts of information, especially valuable personally identifiable identification. There’s no reason to expect this kind of thing is going to slow down,” he told Decrypt.\nLopp argued that companies should try to delete such data where possible.\nOn the issue of the threatening phishing attacks, he said, “Most of that is going to be scareware, that is not going to be backed up by someone.”\nBut he said that scammers could use the attacks to select high-profile targets. Since attacking someone at home is risky, he said that attackers would do a lot of research first, checking if someone has a luxury car or house.\nLopp said, “But if it does turn into a sort of catalyst for a new wave of physical attacks, that’s gonna be a turning point. Maybe more people will finally start taking their privacy more seriously in this space.”\nHe added that affected customers should weigh their own situation and decide on what they should do to protect their identity.\n“So, if you have a lot to lose, if the vast majority of your net worth is tied up in liquid bearer crypto assets and especially if you have them secured in a way that you’re vulnerable to physical attack, you’re vulnerable to being coerced into moving all or most of your wealth with a few clicks of a button,” he said.\nHe recommended that those who fit this category should consider having a greater focus on personal security, up to the point of doing what he did and starting again.\nLopp argued that Ledger’s customers shouldn’t blame the company for the hack. He said that they chose to give the company their personal addresses, when they could have used mail boxes, or even company addresses, to stay private.\n“It’s kind of ridiculous people saying they want their money back. There is nothing wrong with Ledger’s products. Their products are still secure as far as we know. The insecurity is with the humans using their products. That is a whole other problem set,” he added.\n","create_date":"2020-12-21T19:37:49","tag":"ledger,hack,theft,cryptocurrency,attack","author":"Decrypt / Tim Copeland"},

Exchanges will also need to receive approval from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Korea Internet & Security Agency to operate in the country.\nThe Special Financial Information Law requires local exchanges to obtain an information security management system (ISMS) license from KISA. That would decrease the probability of hacking attacks and security breaches, an issue which South Korean exchanges have struggled to deal with over the past two years.\nTo date, only six exchanges in the country have obtained an ISMS license from KISA, including the “big four”—UPbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit—alongside Gopax and Hanbitco.\nAs part of their compliance efforts, South Korean exchanges are proactively ramping up their quality control efforts by delisting digital assets that do not meet the standards of the exchange.\nIf an asset does not have an active development team that communicates with the exchange to solve key issues, has a low level of development, low volume, and no understanding of South Korea’s crypto market, it becomes subject to a rigorous delisting process.\nThe local crypto industry welcomed the passing of the new legislation. Blockchain Association of South Korea’s chairperson Kim Seong-ah—who also operates major South Korean crypto exchange Hanbitco—said that the legislation would further legitimize the crypto industry over the long-term.\n“The legislation would allow crypto exchange market to escape from poor public perception regarding fraud and malpractice,” she said, adding that it would provide a foundation on which the industry could build transparency and trust.\n","create_date":"2020-03-05T10:27:04","tag":"law,FATF,south korea","author":"Decrypt / Joseph Young"},

It recommended that Hong Kong tighten policies concerning crypto and companies dealing with the asset class, to comply more closely with its standards.\nThe changes to Hong Kong’s AML and terrorist financing prevention framework were proposed as a part of its annual 2020-21 budget, and will go through a process of public consultation before being finalized.\nHong Kong’s swift adoption of the FATF’s crypto guidelines comes in the wake of a push by the G20 to encourage compliance.\nOn February 23, the G20 said:\n“Building on the 2019 Leaders’ Declaration, we urge countries to implement the recently adopted Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards on virtual assets and related providers. We reiterate our statement in October 2019 regarding the so-called ‘global stablecoins’ and other similar arrangements that such risks need to be evaluated and appropriately addressed before they commence operation, and support the FSB’s efforts to develop regulatory recommendations with respect to these arrangements.”\n\n\nOther major cryptocurrency markets, including Japan and South Korea, are moving to comply with the FATF’s guidelines.\nBased on secretary Chan’s statement, the tightened policies are expected to primarily affect exchanges and potentially remittance service providers handling cryptocurrencies.\nWith Bitspark, a major cryptocurrency remittance company in Hong Kong, having shut down in early February due to protests and coronavirus fears, it remains to be seen what impact the enhanced framework will have on Hong Kong’s crypto exchanges and remittance markets.\n","create_date":"2020-02-26T10:54:04","tag":"Hong Kong,g20,G7,FATF","author":"Decrypt / Joseph Young"},

In the last two months, the amount of value locked up in DeFi protocols has shot up from $1 billion to $4 billion, thanks largely to a new concept called “yield farming.” It’s been a crazy success; one project, yEarn Finance’s YFI token, grew in value by 14,900%—in under a week.\nNumbers like that have dollar signs flashing in front of hopeful investors’ eyes, recalling the ICO boom of 2017. But, caution experts, they also point to an emerging bubble; one that could pop at any moment.\n“Basically a worst case scenario for DeFi is the ICO bubble of 2017 combined with the Great Financial Crisis of 2008,” said Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen. But, he said, while there are signs of a bubble forming, “it’s also quite different from the 2017 ICO bubble in a few key ways.”\n$YFI price 6 days ago: $34.53$YFI high today: $3,052.40\nThis may be the fastest 100x in the history of crypto. Defi is wild.\nh/t @Rewkang pic.twitter.com/tSoofDkLAV\n— Luke Martin (@VentureCoinist) July 24, 2020\n\nSvanevik pointed to the example of YFI, the governance token for yield aggregator yEarn. “It has a much more bottom-up distribution,” he said. “And in fact there are signs that retail investors managed to move ahead of the whales on this one, in stark contrast to the ICO boom where whales were getting sweet deals behind the scenes.”\nDeFi is a small part of the crypto industry when compared to bigger projects like XRP, which has a market valuation of $11 billion. But for those involved, there’s a lot of money at stake.\n“Clearly we are in the early stages of a DeFi bubble,” said Will Price, data scientist at Flipside Crypto. “But if DeFi has any chance of being a new financial future, valuations are still extremely low. Compare the innovations happening now with assets like XRP, LTC, BCH.”\nJon Jordan, communications director at Dappradar, argued that were the bubble to pop, it would not have a huge impact.\n“I don't think valuations are currently at a level that makes the bubble popping damaging,” he said, adding, “The [Bitcoin] price bubble of late 2017, for example, was of another magnitude and was very damaging when it popped.”\nBut he added the caveat that, “If yield farming spreads outside of DeFi that would potentially drive a much larger valuation bubble.”\nThe explosive growth in DeFi is largely down to the practice of yield farming. Yield farming is where a DeFi project creates tokens to reward those who provide liquidity on the service, whether it’s a borrowing and lending application or a token exchange. But to provide this liquidity, you have to put your tokens into the project—meaning you can’t sell or trade them.\nAs more Ethereum and other tokens have been sucked into these DeFi applications—to benefit from the high yields on offer—it has reduced the supply available for trading. It’s no surprise that the price of Ethereum has shot up to $340, a value not seen since June 2019.\nBut a recent Dappradar report shows that, while the yields are incentivizing value to move into the DeFi space, they haven’t improved the sector’s fundamentals. It pointed to Compound, the second biggest DeFi app, which has had a steady decline in users since the craze started.\nYet the investors who are involved, are increasing their risk—not just through putting their money in the system, but by leveraging it to get the maximum yields.\nSvanevik pointed out that even though these leveraged loans are overcollateralized, an important safety mechanism, “there are several risk factors, including: poor liquidity of collateralized assets, oracles failing, congestion of the network and liquidation mechanisms breaking down.”\nThis means that not only is money flowing into the DeFi space at a rate of knots—inflating the bubble—there is a risk that some of the money within it might be overleveraged, and could end badly.\nWhich sounds like a recipe for disaster.\nUpdate: This article has been updated to reflect that Alex Svanevik is CEO of Nansen, not D5—which, as a DAO, does not have a CEO.\n","create_date":"2020-07-31T15:26:38","tag":"investment,DeFi,finance,Ethereum,money","author":"Decrypt / Shaurya Malwa, Tim Copeland"},

This firmly places it in the top four layer-2 solutions, behind Arbitrum, Optimism and zkSync Era.\nArbitrum continues to be the most utilized by Ethereum users, with 600,000 average daily transactions, offering a 200,000 margin from the main competitors mentioned by Messari: Base and Optimism. These two, wrote Goel, have “cannibalized” Arbitrum’s network activity, with transactions dropping 36% during the third quarter.\n21.co’s Dune dashboard reveals an important lead for Arbitrum in terms of TVL, as well. Its $4.22 billion is nearly threefold that of Optimism, which lands in second, at $1.27 billion. That said, both have been flipping their market capitalizations of late, and according to Coingecko, the former leads with a $30 million margin, sitting currently at $1.067 billion.\nAs per Goel, the fact that Layer-2s are taking the lead in terms of transaction throughput is not surprising. He told Decrypt that “the longer-term view has always been that L2 transactions will overtake Ethereum's,” adding, “it was clear during the bull market of 2020-21 that Ethereum mainnet's block space alone wasn't going to be enough.”\nThe view resonated with Eliezer Ndinga, head of research for 21.co. He told Decrypt that his company had predicted this to be the trend, since “blockchains are quite limited in scale.”\nNdinga explained that these scaling solutions are “analogous to how bandwidth pushed the boundaries of what’s possible on the Internet from the era of dial-up where web pages were taking minutes to load on a web browser.”\nThe analyst bullishly called these layer-2s “a force to be reckoned with,” especially as “reputable financial institutions” start to adopt the technology.\nWhat Goel unveiled today has him bullish–as it should the Ethereum community at large. “The greater activity there is on L2s, the higher their market caps, the higher security they want from Ethereum, and higher demand for Ethereum's data availability service,” he told Decrypt.\nHe also shared what “the biggest thing” to watch is: how much cheaper L2s can get after the Dencun upgrade, and “once they get cheaper,” how much more activity they will see.\n“My long-term view is that all DEX trades should move to L2s as lower transaction fees help the most with high-velocity transactions,” he concluded.\n","create_date":"2023-10-10T01:36:08","tag":"Layer 2,Ethereum,Optimism,Arbitrum,coinbase,Base","author":"Decrypt / Pedro Solimano"},

Along with surgical masks and laser pointers to evade surveillance cameras, the secure messaging app has become an indispensable weapon in the modern day protestor’s arsenal.\nTelegram groups—autonomous, leaderless and made up of hundreds of thousands of protestors—are enabling the world’s most decentralized revolution to date. Today, Hong Kong’s groups once again published a slew of news and video footage—unavailable on “approved” media—about the city’s protests, which are now entering their eighth consecutive week.\nDetails of 45 more arrests, assaults on journalists and civilians, over 100 open letters of support from Hong Kong industry leaders, as well as plans for a general strike next Monday were publicized.\nHong Kong’s protests began in June over a law, later shelved, that would allow extradition from semi-autonomous Hong Kong to mainland China. But they've now spread to reflect wider demands for democratic reform and freedom for those arrested.\nAnd the battles have been fought, not only on the streets of the city, but digitally—on the messaging apps installed on the laptops and mobiles of hundreds of thousands of protestors.\nDecrypt spoke with a number of group members and organizers and, for reasons involving their personal safety, agreed to use pseudonyms.\n“We owe the existence of the protests to it—mainly Telegram, live media and a whole lot of other social media,” said “Josh,” a Telegram group coordinator.\nProtest organisers use the encrypted messaging available within Telegram to share sensitive information and evade the increasingly sophisticated surveillance of Beijing backed authorities.\nThe app allows them to form groups and—along with other social media, such as Signal, Facebook and WhatsApp—to disseminate video footage and updates, details on how and where to rally, and requests for additional supplies.\n7-21 in Hong Kong (from Telegram) pic.twitter.com/aRoWFAudB7\n— Kiwi (@kiwigummy) July 22, 2019\n\n“Ruth,\" another of the groups’ organizers, told Decrypt that secrecy was one of the main reasons why secure, encrypted messaging apps, such as Telegram, have been so effective in protecting personal information while enabling effective communication.\n“We know that our biggest ‘enemy’ is IT security. As long as Big China doesn’t understand how it works, its safe for now,” she said.\nShe also revealed how dissenters are shunning Chinese-made apps and devices in the interests of anonymity.\n“It’s worse if you are using a mobile phone made in China, especially Huawei,” she claimed. “Everything in the phone is being mirrored to the server.”\nTo maximise security, groups such as theirs have no official leaders and members are unaware of each others’ identity. “We don’t know each other and what we are doing in each team,” said “Christie,” another member of the group.\nEvery day, activists as young as 16, are going analog; they’re buying single-ride subway tickets, forgoing credit cards and giving up on posting selfies to limit their digital footprint.\n“Telegram is an improvement because its policies forbid information to be submitted to the police directly,” said Josh.\nThe app is also popular in both Hong Kong AND in Russia, where similar protects are occurring, because it offers a ‘Secret Chat’ function, allowing messages to be encrypted, deleted at any time, and set to “self-destruct” after a set period.\nThe measure comes into its own against a backdrop of police intrusiveness. Group members described armed officers grabbing protestors phones, and forcing them to unlock the devices using their faces and fingers.\nReports also claim that police are unmasking protestors to photograph them for China’s much publicized facial recognition programme.\nTelegram was developed by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, and his brother Nikolai. The company is now registered in both the US and the UK, after Durov fled from Russia when authorities demanded he hand over information about dissident group using the app.\nThe startup plans to release its GRAM cryptocurrency in the Fall, and to launch the Telegram Open Network (TON), a blockchain platform for the development and deployment of dapps, to rival Ethereum and EOS.\nTelegram’s messaging app has been banned in China since 2015, and in Russia and Iran since last year. But protestors have managed to find ways around the ban, and Durov's team has proved adept at moving its servers to stay one step ahead of the authorities.\nBut “the Great Firewall of China” wasn’t named in jest. Chinese authorities have perfected the art of Internet surveillance. They’ve been accused of launching a massive cyberattack against Telegram’s servers just hours prior to a demonstration last month, putting the network temporarily out of action.\nHong Kong authorities have also attempted to clamp down on Telegram group members, which protestors say is taking cues from the ways China polices the Internet.\nEarlier this month, police swooped in and arrested Telegram coordinator Ivan Ip at his home, several miles from the protests in Hong Kong, accusing him of conspiracy to commit a public nuisance. He faces up to 10 years in jail.\nThe police officers implied that they had traced him from his phone number, which was linked to his identification.\nFollowing his arrest, groups redoubled their security measures, warning their members that, while Telegram conversations can be encrypted, the service does not have end-to-end encryption for its group chats. They also advised the use of pay-as-you-go SIM cards and using a foreign number to register online and join groups.\nIn fact, the measures being adopted by the Hong Kong authorities have become more extreme.\n“The government is stopping people by all means—like police brutality, violence to everyone on the street and white terror on social media,” said Ruth.\nPeople, she added, are afraid. They know what’s at risk but see no future in a Hong Kong that is coming increasingly under China’s influence.\nMeanwhile China has condemned the protests as \"horrendous incidents\" that have caused \"serious damage to the rule of law.” And, according to reports, Chinese forces are now gathering at the border.\n","create_date":"2019-07-31T18:28:38","tag":"Hong Kong,social media,politics,china,Technology,Telegram","author":"Decrypt / Adriana Hamacher"},

But neither is gold right now - Decrypt","content":" The price of gold has fallen four percent today, continuing its price slide from last week.\nGold has a longstanding reputation as a hedge against uncertainty, with its price traditionally rising when other stocks are falling. Bitcoiners argue that the same applies to Bitcoin: that it is designed to counter an economy that prints money at will, and where inflation is rampant. They call it ‘digital gold’.\nThis narrative has come under strain over the last week. As the economy has fallen out of the sky, so has the price of Bitcoin. It is now down more than 50% from $9,600 to its current value of $4,770.\nHowever, gold has been following the decline of the stock markets too. After rising 30% over the last year, it has dropped by 11% over the last nine days, seeing further declines today.\n“Things are so bad that even gold is not a safe haven,” tweeted Bovell Global Macro, a hedge fund based in the Cayman Islands.\nFew investments are performing well right now; the only exceptions are cash and certain stocks, such as products that support remote working.\nThings are so bad that even gold is not a safe-haven.\n— Bovell Global Macro (@Bovell_GM) March 16, 2020\n\nDespite this, goldbugs remain certain that its status as a safe haven is secure.\nAccording to the Telegraph, traders have been selling gold to cover losses in the stock market—or to buy stocks at a discount. And that, once the market rebounds, the prices should bounce back.\nPeter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, tweeted: “Gold is falling because investors are clueless as to what is coming. Their mindset is similar to that of central bankers. They have no idea how bad the consequences of the current monetary & fiscal policy mistakes will be. When they figure it out en masse, gold will skyrocket.”\nGold is falling because investors are clueless as to what is coming. Their mindset is similar to that of central bankers.

{"url":"https://decrypt.co/26749/the-best-crypto-metal-wallets-you-can-buy-now","web_url":"https://decrypt.co/","type":"article","description":"Your cryptocurrency is only as secure as your seed phrase. We review some of the most popular metal wallets designed to keep it safe.","title":"The best crypto metal wallets you can buy now (UPDATED) - Decrypt","content":" When it comes to safely storing cryptocurrencies, hardware crypto wallets are generally considered to be the gold standard for secure storage and accessibility.\nAlthough cold storage devices like the Ledger Nano X and Cobo Vault are certainly a secure way to store digital assets, ultimately they're only as secure as the seed phrase they use to access and manage these assets. This seed phrase is usually a 12 to 24-word phrase that can be used to generate all of the addresses and private keys associated with a wallet when recovered. Most hardware wallets ship with a card that can be used to record this seed phrase, but this can be damaged or lost, making it impossible to recover the wallet.\nThat's where metal wallets and other more robust seed storage kits come in. They're used to protect seed phrases, private keys, and other sensitive information against damage, ensuring it remains intact even under extreme conditions. Like hardware wallets, there are now a huge variety of different seed storage solutions on the market, each of which promises to keep your seed phrase protected against myriad threats, such as natural disasters and fires.\nWe've rounded up some of the best seed storage options on the market for our review.\nIf there is one name that's practically synonymous with the term \"metal wallet,\" it's CryptoSteel. Billed as the \"mother of all backups\", the CryptoSteel Capsule is an incredibly secure offline storage solution for cryptocurrency private keys, mnemonic phrases, passwords and practically anything else that can be expressed with uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as symbols and spaces.\nThe CryptoSteel Capsule is rated fireproof up to 1400°C/2500°F, completely waterproof, and can resist extreme crushing and shocks. The unit measures in at 102 mm in length and 16 mm in diameter, making it both portable and inconspicuous.\nThe capsule comprises a hollow shell with an internal core—or rail—which is used to hold individual tiles, each of which is engraved with a single letter or symbol. These tiles are placed onto the rail in the correct sequence and are secured with a fastener—this simply prevents the tiles from falling off the core, ensuring they stay in their correct order. The CryptoSteel Capsule can store up to 123 characters of information, sufficient to hold an entire 12-word recovery seed or an abbreviated 24-word one.\nAs its name suggests, the CryptoSteel Capsule is a capsule-like metal wallet that is constructed out of two types of stainless steel. The outer shell is made from 303-grade stainless steel, which offers extreme strength and defense against water, fire and pressure, and doesn't deform with time, whereas the core is made 304-grade stainless steel, which also offers excellent strength, as well as corrosion and heat resistance. The tiles, fasteners, and separators are made from the same 304-grade stainless steel. The CryptoSteel capsule is available from the official store for €89, but sets of two or more capsules can be purchased for a discount.\nOur Verdict: 4.5/5\nIf you have the budget for it, the CryptoSteel capsule is easily one of the most versatile and secure offline secret storage solutions available.\ncryptosteel.com\nThe Crypto Key Stack is a popular mnemonic seed storage solution that's designed to resist a range of physical threats without compromising data.\nLike many metal wallets, the Crypto Key Stack takes the form of a set of metal plates—black anodized stainless steel, in this case—stacked together and held in place with a screw. These plates come in two types: the first is engraved with the numbers 1 to 24, with a space for etching a mnemonic word next to it; whereas the second type is blank, used for covering the engraving plates or inscribing generic data.\nThe Crypto Key Stack plates are designed to be engraved—a process Crypto Key Stack claims will take around five minutes. Once engraved with a suitable tool such as a Dremel, the plates can be screwed together and stored in a safe place, and shouldn't need to be touched until the mnemonic seed is needed again. The engraving process is relatively simple, but we recommend practicing on a disposable metal surface first to get the hang of it.\nAccording to Crypto Key Stack, the product has survived the likes of a butane torch, acid bath, and a 20-ton hydraulic press and remained legible, making it one of the most battle-tested metal wallets around. The Crypto Key Stack is available from the official store in a variety of bundles. The cheapest costs $44.99 and includes a single engraving plate, two blank cover plates, and a battery-powered engraver. The most popular setup—the Key Stack Stealth Explorer bundle—comes in at $69.99 for three engraving plates, two blank plates, and an engraver.\nOur Verdict: 4/5\nIn terms of value for money, you can't go wrong with the Crypto Key Stack.\ncryptokeystack.com\nThe Cobo Tablet is a sleek mnemonic storage device that can be used to keep 12, 18, and 24-word BIP39 recovery seeds safe from a variety of threats. Like many metal wallets, the Cobo Tablet is designed to store the first four characters of each BIP39 seed word.\nMeasuring a slimline 60 mm x 105 mm x 6.5 mm, the Cobo Tablet is one of the more aesthetically pleasing storage options available. It's constructed entirely out of 304-grade stainless steel, rated as fireproof up to 1455°C or 2651°F, resistant to most types of corrosion, and completely waterproof.\nUnlike some of its rivals, the Cobo Tablet doesn't require any specialized tools to set up. Instead, owners simply need to press out the letters from the supplied metal sheet and insert them into the unit, after which they're secured in place with a screw-on cover. The Tablet can then be rotated shut to keep its contents hidden from view. The package also includes tamper-proof stickers, which can be used to reveal if the Cobo Tablet has been opened after sealing. The latest version also includes a padlock hole, which can be used to further secure the wallet.\nAt $39, the Cobo Tablet is by far the cheapest option on this list, making it suitable for those on a budget. However, for those looking to splurge, the Cobo Tablet can also be purchased in combination with the Cobo Vault hardware wallet—setting you back a rather more substantial $479.\nOur Verdict: 3.5/5\nThe Cobo Tablet is an excellent budget option for those looking to securely store their Bitcoin recovery seed.\ncobo.com\nMany metal wallets require an intricate, fiddly setup process. Not so the Blockplate, which is just about as simple as they come.\nIt takes the form of a square, metal slab with the numbers 1 to 12 engraved on one axis, and A to Z engraved on the other to form a grid. Each unit is constructed out of thick 12-gauge 304-grade stainless steel and can store a total of 12 recovery words. Two plates can store an entire 24-word BIP39 recovery phrase, whereas a single plate is sufficient for a 12-word BIP39 seed.\nUnlike some other metal wallets, the Blockplate is only designed to secure recovery words; it's not suitable for storing other kinds of confidential information such as private keys, passwords, or encryption keys since it cannot record symbols, numbers or different letter cases.\nThe Blockplate works by storing the first four letters of each recovery word—all that's actually required to successfully recover a wallet, since no two BIP39 words share the same first four letters. These letters are first marked on the Blockplate with a marker and can then be stamped permanently using an automatic center punch, which will leave a permanent dent in each box. The Blockplate doesn't come with an automatic center punch, but these can be purchased for an additional $10 on the Blockplate store—or for a few bucks at your local hardware store.\nEach plate measures in at 84 mm x 78 mm x 2.8 mm and is heat resistant up to 2100°F, as well as being both water and corrosion-resistant. However, the Blockplate is not tamper-resistant like some other metal wallets, and does not come with a cover or case used to obscure the inscribed information. At $69 for a double pack, the Blockplate is one of the cheaper metal wallet solutions on the market—but this does come at the cost of reduced versatility.\nOur Verdict: 3.5/5\nThe Blockplate represents a solid low budget option, but is only suitable for those looking to store a BIP39 seed phrase and nothing else.\nblockplate.com\nThe Hodlinox is a simple metal storage plate that is used to store Bitcoin (BTC) and other 12 to 24-word recovery phrases securely. It's available in a variety of designs, all of which are constructed out of thick, stainless steel and engraved with easy to read guidelines for seed words.\nUnlike some other recovery phrase storage devices, the Hodlinox requires owners to manually engrave or stamp their seed phrase onto their plate, physically marking it onto the metal. 'Martin', the founder of the project, believes that this solution is more secure than assembling letters into a series, since there's no chance of the letters falling out of the storage medium.\nDepending on your needs, the Hodlinox is available in a range of formats, ranging from the cheapest option, a single plate without a case at €29, to a double plate at €49, to the most expensive option—a pack of 10 double plates for €395. The website only accepts payment in Bitcoin.\nThe single plate option is double-sided with recovery words 1-12 written on one side, and 13-24 on the other side. The double plate option instead comes with two single-sided plates that are attached together with a screw, which would need to be unscrewed to view the recovery phrase. The Hodlinox also ships with a tamper-proof seal which will be damaged if the Hodlinox is forced open—either metal or plastic, depending on whether you're using a single or double Hodlinox setup.\nSince the Hodlinox is constructed out of stainless steel, it's inherently water and fire-resistant.\nRating: 4/5\nCosting just €29 for the single plate model, the Hodlinox represents great value for money. However, it is more secure when you use an engraver rather than a marker pen, so consider factoring that in as a cost.\nhodlinox.com\nThe CypherWheel is a robust metal wallet machined out of 5/16\" thick stainless steel. Coming in at 191mm x 11.4mm x 7.6mm and weighing around 300 grams, the CypherWheel certainly looks and feels like a heavy-duty piece of equipment.\nAlthough many seed storage tools are designed to feature as few moving parts as possible, the CypherWheel is different from most. Users of the CypherWheel need to slide the individual tiles for each letter of their private information into the wheel through individual ramps machined into its body. This is a rather fiddly process, but the CypherWheel is supplied with a pair of tweezers to make things easier.\nThere are 24 different segments in total, and the CypherWheel is compatible with both BIP39 and SLIP39 seed phrases, and can store up to 96 characters of confidential information. Once the tiles have been inserted, a supplied punch tool is used to lock the letters into place, preventing them from accidentally falling out.\nUnlike most other metal wallets, the Cypherwheel can be used to store just about any sensitive information, which can include Bitcoin private keys, seed phrases, passwords, or anything else that can be formed from the letters A to Z. However, it is primarily designed for seed phrases, since each segment of the wheel is numbered from 1 to 24, just like a BIP39 recovery mnemonic.\nEach word of the seed can be revealed by rotating an internal disc, and the entire unit can be locked using either the supplied security seal—which will break if the device is unlocked—or a standard padlock through the hole in the unit.\nThe CypherWheel is extremely solid, and waterproof, dustproof, and fireproof up to 2,000 degrees. However, all this security comes at a steep cost—200 on the official CypherSafe web shop. Nonetheless, if security is your top priority, then you will struggle to find a more versatile and robust metal seed storage solution.\nRating: 3.5/5\nThe CypherWheel is by far the most robust and most expensive option on this list. But if cost is no object, this is the one we'd pick.\ncyphersafe.io\nAs its name suggests, the Ellipal Mnemonic Metal is a metal cryptocurrency backup solution that allows owners to safely store their 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. It comes in an 86mm x 60mm x 8mm clam-shell form factor and is constructed primarily from aluminum.\nAccording to its product description, the Ellipal Mnemonic Metal is designed to be fireproof, waterproof, and insect-proof, helping to keep the recovery phrase protected against most potential physical threats. However, although the Ellipal Mnemonic Metal has a durable build, it's not listed as crush-proof—though we were unable to manually bend the item while reviewing it.\nThe Ellipal Mnemonic Metal is designed to store the first four letters of up to a 24-word BIP39 recovery phrase. Since the first four letters are unique to each word in the BIP39 word list, it is not necessary to store the complete word to safely back up your mnemonic phrase. Many wallets will actually fill in the rest of the word automatically after typing in the first four letters during the wallet recovery process.\nIt comes supplied with a variety of letter stamps in addition to a screwdriver. Each letter is popped from its sheet and can be inserted into the case after unscrewing a numbered front-panel with the included screwdriver. Once all the letters are in place, the front panel can be screwed back on, and the entire wallet can be locked shut with a padlock (not included).\nThe Ellipal Mnemonic Metal currently retails for $49, but can be had for just $29 when purchased alongside the Ellipal Titan hardware wallet. As such, it's one of the cheapest metal wallet solutions on the market currently.\nRating: 3/5\nThe Ellipal Mnemonic Metal is a robust, relatively inexpensive solution for storing 12-24 word seed phrases.\nellipal.com\nUnlike the other options on this list, the D'CENT Card Wallet is designed specifically for Ethereum (ETH) and differs in the way that it keeps your funds safe. The Card Wallet comes in a credit card-like form factor with an Ethereum address and its associated QR code printed on the front, in addition to a PIN hidden beneath a scratch off panel.\nRather than requiring you to set up a hardware wallet or back up a recovery phrase using a metal storage solution, the D’CENT Card Wallet instead acts as a private key storage and authorization card. The device ships with a single Ethereum address and the private key associated with it, which can be used to store Ethereum offline. This private key is protected by an EAL5+ certified secure chip, which is able to communicate with a mobile device via a built-in RF antenna.\nThe D'CENT Card Wallet represents an interesting compromise between security and functionality. Alone, the card simply stores Ethereum securely offline, but can be combined with a dedicated mobile application used for managing payments. As such, the D'CENT Card Wallet makes it possible to store Ethereum offline, while also providing an easy access route to funds.\nHowever, this does come with a significant compromise—D'CENT generates both the address and the private key of each D'CENT Card Wallet sold, and information on how it keeps this information secure is scanty. Nonetheless, at just $12.99 from the official D'CENT store for $12.99, the D'CENT Card Wallet could be a convenient option for storing and using small amounts of ETH.\nRating: 2/5\nAt just $12.99 the D'CENT Card Wallet is extremely cheap, but the pre-generated private key is a no-go for us.\ndecentwallet.com\n","create_date":"2020-05-21T15:50:39","tag":"Hodlinox,Ellipal Mnemonic Metal,hardware wallet,Seed,Private Key,Cobo Tablet,Blockplate,Crypto Key Stack,CryptoSteel Capsule,CypherWheel","author":"Decrypt / Daniel Phillips"},

Some think it’ll increase the price of ETH, but many miners aren’t happy about it.","title":"An Upgrade to Reduce the Supply of Ethereum Gets a Launch Date - Decrypt","content":" An Ethereum upgrade that lowers the volatility of transaction fees has been scheduled for Ethereum’s next major hard fork.\nThe upgrade, EIP-1559 (EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal), is scheduled to go live in Ethereum’s “London” hard fork this July.\nThe proposal reduces the volatility of Ethereum's transaction fees by burning the ETH instead of using it to pay miners.\nAlthough miners will lose money, analysts think that the upgrade could pump the price of Ethereum and make it cheaper to use.\nEIP-1559 overhauls the way users pay Ethereum’s transaction fees. Currently, fees are paid to miners for processing transactions.\nThe cost of those fees depends on the supply of miners and users’ demand for them. If there’s a bottleneck on the network, miners can charge usurious rates of over $20 per transaction.\nEIP-1559 would replace the supply/demand auction-style system in place today with a standard rate across the network. The fee, called “BASEFEE,” would rise when the market is busy and fall when it’s quiet.\nThe crucial difference is that the fee is set by the network and altered by burning ETH. EIP-1559 means that miners don’t set the rates; the network does. And the transaction fees don’t go to miners; they’re burned.\nTim Ogilvie, CEO of Ethereum infrastructure firm Staked, told Decrypt that it’s likely to be “positive on the long term price of Ethereum.” Lower and more predictable gas fees, he said, means that Ethereum isn’t just for the rich, encouraging people to build and use the network.\nOgilvie told Decrypt last month that burning ETH would also increase the price because it makes ETH more scarce. Instead of distributing fees to miners, that ETH is gone for good.\nThe upgrade is not without its critics. Two of the three largest Ethereum miners are angry that it would dig into their fees, and a further 10 have announced their discontent with the upgrade.\nSpark Pool, a mining pool that controls 26% of the hashrate, opposes the upgrade, as does Ethermine.org, which controls 21.8% of Ethereum’s hash rate.\nFlexpool, a small Ethereum mining pool that’s against the proposal, said it is like “Instead of giving the waiter a tip, you just burn it in front of him while laughing at him.” F2Pool, which controls 11.4% of the hash rate, supports the EIP.\nCan we take this to mean that F2Pool would support 1559 (assuming it's safe, has community support, etc. etc.)?\n— Tim Beiko | timbeiko.eth 🦇🔊 (@TimBeiko) January 20, 2021\n\n“I don't think miners are going to be long-term winners here. I think they're gonna fight. But I think there are going to be long term losers,” said Ogilvie. Ethereum 2.0, the long-awaited Ethereum upgrade, transitions the blockchain from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake one. The former rewards miners for processing transactions, the latter rewards people who hold lots of Ethereum.\n“I think this is close to existential for a mining business,” said Ogilvie. “And so I think they're going to take the strongest actions they can. How far are they willing to go? I can't really predict. But I think I think you're gonna see them fight extremely hard,” he said.\nTim Beiko, a ConsenSys product manager overseeing the implementation, told Decrypt that there isn’t much standing in the way of its implementation. “Like any other EIPs, if we find a serious vulnerability that could not be fixed in time, we would remove it, but aside from that, it would go into London,” he said.\n","create_date":"2021-03-05T21:46:21","tag":"EIP-1559,Ethereum,Blockchain,Technology,cryptocurrency","author":"Decrypt / Robert Stevens"},

According to the prospective DEA contract, Coinbase's software will provide \"identity attribution\" for crypto addresses both domestically and internationally.\nThe public documents were issued on May 18 and April 7, respectively. Industry publication The Block was first to report the news.\nCoinbase would not comment directly on the federal contracts. However, a spokesperson for the San Francisco-based company told Decrypt that the firm offers its Coinbase Analytics product to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies to support compliance and investigation purposes.\n\"This tool only offers them streamlined access to publicly-available data and at no point do they have access to any Coinbase internal or customer data,\" the company said.\nCoinbase also stressed that Coinbase Analytics data \"does not include any personally identifiable information for anyone, regardless of whether or not they use Coinbase.\"\nThe company also said that it uses the product internally for compliance and global investigations. And confirmed that it developed Coinbase Analytics with technology from Neutrino, a blockchain analysis startup that it acquired last year.\nThe “period of performance” date on the DEA contract extends from April 3, 2020, to April 2, 2021.\nAccording to the contract, Coinbase Analytics “provides investigators with identity attribution and de-anonymities virtual currency addresses domestically and internationally. CA is known for its accuracy of attribution which includes some of the most conservative heuristics used in commercial blockchain tracing tools. This is critical in avoiding false positives during target identification.”\nThe contract also states that “this is the least expensive tool on the market and has the most features for the money.”\nCoinbase could make any anywhere from $10,000 to $250,000 on the deal, according to details in the contract.\nIn an email response, the DEA told Decrypt that it will not comment further beyond what is in the public record.\nThe IRS contract reads that the IRS criminal investigation cyber crimes unit “requires a software tool that can assist in the tracing of various types of cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin” in support of its law enforcement investigative mission.\nNeutrino is specifically mentioned in the contract, which states that the tool “allows for the analysis and tracking of cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains that criminals are currently using.\"\nIt goes on to add that “Coinbase Analytics also provides some enhanced law enforcement sensitive capabilities that are not currently found in other tools on the market.”\nThe IRS contract is for one \"base year\" from the date of award with one 12-month option.\nThe agency has not yet responded to a request for comment.\nWhen Coinbase acquired Neutrino in February 2019 for a reported $13.5 million, the move was widely criticized because of the founders’ ties to a controversial surveillance technology company called Hacking Team.\nIn March of last year, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong responded to the controversy by announcing that anyone associated with Hacking Team would be \"transitioned out\" of the company.\nEditor's note: This article was updated to provide further details regarding the DEA and IRS contracts.

What we failed to do was due diligence more around our values and our culture.”\nArmstrong explained that Coinbase needed new analytics software and the choice was between developing it in-house, acquiring someone or investing. In the end, the company decided to buy blockchain analytics platform Neutrino.\n“This is an instance where we messed up. We should’ve done more diligence. Since that happened, we revamped our diligence process to include these kinds of reputational checks in the process. There’s really no excuse I can give you,” Armstrong acknowledged.\nAs Decrypt reported, after Coinbase’s acquisition, commentators were quick to point out that key members of Neutrino were linked to an Italian organization called Hacking Team, known for selling spyware to authoritarian regimes in Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Venezuela. As McCormack put it, “some of their work led to journalists being arrested and deaths of people.”\nArmstrong said that after realizing that Coinbase could’ve hired some “black hats,” he insisted on first speaking to Neutrino staff to find out how much of this was true. After assessing the situation, he sacked some of the ex-Hacking Team members but did not specify who.\nAll of the key people who had “some kind of question mark or reputational or values issue” were let go from the company, he said. While some lower-level engineers who “were not the decision-makers and weren’t as culpable” remained with the company.\nSince then, Coinbase has continued to develop its blockchain analytics software, offering it up as a service to the DEA and IRS. On this, Armstrong recognized that it’s not a popular move but that such measures are needed to connect the fiat and crypto worlds.\n“One of those unfortunate realities of the world, like we didn’t create it, is that the AML kind of regulations are increasing,” he noted, adding that, “Blockchain analytics companies, Chainalysis and others, are essentially selling data that is publicly available. So that’s what Coinbase analytics is doing too.”\nAt the same time, the exchange is paying a lot of money in taxes to the IRS, so providing agencies with some paid analytics service could be a way to get some of it back, he explained.\n“They can go and buy this kind of blockchain analytics software anywhere they want, so I think we should get some money back for it if we have to do it as a cost of doing business,” said Armstrong.\nOn the other hand, he also acknowledged that the amount of revenue is “pretty negligible” and Coinbase even considered providing this service for free but “apparently the government doesn’t let you do that.”\n","create_date":"2020-07-24T14:28:00","tag":"hacking group,neutrino,bitcoin,Breaking Push,Brian Armstrong,coinbase","author":"Decrypt / Liam Frost"},

Here's why China is cracking down on some exchanges—but not all of them.","title":"Inside China's crackdown on crypto exchanges - Decrypt","content":" It’s pretty well known in the west that China has been hammering crypto exchanges, again, in the worst crackdown since 2017. According to government mouthpiece Xinhua, more than 500 people have been arrested, and more than 300 crypto influencers’ social media accounts have been shuttered.\nBut a lot of the recent reporting fails to capture the nuances of what’s really going on there, and why. The idea that the Government is at war with all crypto exchanges is simply not true. Some, such as Huobi, in fact, are actually benefitting from the Government’s good graces.\nSo what’s going on there? This special Thanksgiving edition of Da Bing will try to feed your head.\nThe upstart exchange\n“You are not running a good ponzi business if you are not on MXC, aka Matcha Exchange.\" (没有上抹茶的项目方，都不好意思说自己是搞传销的.)\nThis is actually an expression often heard in the Chinese crypto community. While many in the west are familiar with the Big 3 exchanges in China (the so-called “HBO” of Huobi, Binance, and Okex) a smaller exchange, called MXC, is more typical of the kind of site that has captured the public’s—and the Government’s—attention.\nMXC, which launched in Sichuan in early 2018, describes itself as “more than just an exchange” and claims to be “the world’s leading assets trading platform.” Though the site is available in different languages and claims to be used by investors in 70 countries, it was believed to be especially popular with Chinese retail investors in the third- and fourth-tier cities, where investors are relatively unsophisticated.\nThe site famously ran a competition to come up with its Chinese nickname among the crypto community, and the winner was given a prize. The moniker “Matcha” won, in part because matcha tea is green, an auspicious color indicating a bullish market.\nBirth of the \"Resonance token\"\nMXC gained notoriety via its VDS token project, whose value rose 5,137% in two months. It then crashed to almost nothing, immediately after its peak. It was considered to be a classic pump and dump, well covered as such by the press in China.\nNotably, VDS is traded differently from traditional tokens. It created the first so-called “Resonance (共振)” token, a model wherein investors must first deposit mainstream tokens, such as BTC and ETH, in a VDS wallet, in exchange for VDS tokens. While that is, of course, similar to typical token trading, here the trading price is portrayed as VDS “resonating with,” say, BTC or ETH. The earlier you get in, the more VDS tokens you can get in exchange for your 1 BTC or 1 ETH. That dynamic created a kind of psychological effect where people rushed to open VDS wallets and deposit BTC in exchange for the VDS Resonance tokens.\nWhy would anyone trade valuable, real crypto for fake tokens? The exchange created a go-go-go! environment where unsophisticated retail investors felt time pressure to buy as early as possible. They didn’t understand that once the pumping ended, the dumping started.\nAccording to the financial news site Caijing, 53% of MXC’s token projects reached their highest valuation on the first day of trading. Indeed, more than 53% of the projects lost over 90% of that peak value, with more than 70% trading below their initial offer price. Only very lucky investors—or, perhaps, people who were privy to the dumping schedule—made money.\nListing by force\nMXC also “pioneered” a form of crypto “futures trading,” in which it listed IEO tokens that would debut on other exchanges—reportedy without the consent of either the projects, or the listing exchanges. According to its CEO and co-founder Eric Yang, this “listing by force” is MXC’s biggest differentiator.\nThat putative feature spurred a frenzy of trading before the tokens were even listed on other exchanges. At the peak of the phenomenon, MXC claimed that Facebook’s Libra would also be listed for “futures trading.”\nBy June, MXC’s trading fees had risen more than 800x compared to Sep 2018. The exchange was growing so fast that some believed Binance rushed back to China earlier this year because it felt threatened by MXC, and other challenges from other upstart exchanges, including Biki and Biss.\n[After this story was published, a spokesman for MXC responded to our request for comment, and referred us to an \"open letter\" written by MXC's founder, Jian Chen, in response to \"many negative and false reports\" about the exchange. \"I hereby promise to everyone that MXC Matcha is a company with a sense of responsibility and responsibility. At any time, it will give top priority to protecting user assets,\" he said.]\nThe crackdown begins\nMatcha’s story received plenty of negative attention in the press. With President Xi’s embrace of blockchain technology, the recent history of MXC and other, similar exchanges, raised unpleasant questions. How could blockchain be good, and yet people were apparently being hoodwinked by blockchain-based cryptocurrencies?\nIt was inevitable that the Government would step in. And it did.\nJust this week Xinhua—the official mouthpiece of the Government—encouraged the public to “resist crypto’s evil path, and open blockchain’s right way” (坚决打击炒币“堵邪路” 引导区块链应用“开正门”).\n“Recently, many people who have participated in ‘currency speculation’ have discovered that the quiet currency circle has begun to ‘boil’ again,” the story said, reminding readers that recent stories “clearly point out that some institutions absorb public funds by issuing so-called ‘virtual currencies,’ ‘virtual assets,’ and ‘digital assets,’ infringing on the legitimate rights and interests of the public. This type of activity is not really based on blockchain technology, but is the practice of speculating on the concept of illegal fundraising, pyramid schemes, and fraud.”\nIt sounds like the same thing we continually hear among the “blockchain-not-Bitcoin” skeptics in the west, but enforced with a much heavier, regulatory jackboot. In recent weeks, the Government arrested 500 people, connected to some highflying exchanges, such as Biss. It shut down over 300 WeChat and Weibo accounts, including those that belong to Binance and Tron.\nThe \"Red Exchange\"\nSo is it curtains for crypto exchanges in China?\nIn fact, a closer look indicates that some of the bigger exchanges aren’t being affected at all.\nSome of them are trying to find ways to cooperate with the Government, which might account for the frequent reports that Binance has been trying to find a way back into Shanghai or Beijing, as a law-abiding, regulation-following good corporate citizen. (It agreed to KYC regulations required by the U.S., and opened up an office in San Francisco recently, afterall.)\nHuobi in particular is toeing the line, and established the first Communist Party Branch as part of its organizational structure. It’s also actively hiring party grandees as part of its process to legitimize itself.\nThat seems to be working especially well for Huobi, too. It’s nickname is the “red” exchange—the character for huo (火) is the same as for fire, but we extend it to mean “red,” too. Houbi has even been sanctified via an investment by the prestigious “ShuiMu QingHua (水木清华) BlockChain Fund,” from QsinghuaCapital, a fund dedicated to support alumnae from Qsinghua University, whose alumni includes none other than Xi himself.\nBut the environment has turned toxic for the smaller, wilder exchanges, who are forced to choose between staying and facing disastrous consequences, or fleeing China.\nMXC decided to leave China at the end of the summer. It withdrew its corporate license to do business in-country, and apparently decamped to Singapore. The BiKi Exchange also seems to have closed down, and its founder is rumored to have left China, presumably afraid of getting jailed, which was the fate of the heads of similar exchanges. Even IDAX announced that it’s leaving China—the CEO is also, coincidentally MIA, and perhaps running faster than the exchange itself.\nMeanwhile, it’s obvious the Government is nervous about all these unsavory “air token” projects 空气币 (slang for scam project). And it will continue to rout these sorts of things from China. The bigger question though is the long-term fate of legitimate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. With investments from the likes of the ShuiMu QingHua BlockChain Fund, it’s way too early to say that the Government has fully embraced “blockchain not bitcoin.” But it has made it clear that air tokens—and the exchanges that promote them—will vanish into the air. Or be suffocated.\nDo you know?\nMost Chinese Exchanges make money from the following fee structures:\n[ Da Bing is a weekly round-up of the most important crypto-related news that happened in China last week.]\n","create_date":"2019-12-01T16:20:36","tag":"MXC,Biki,Binance,Biss,Baidu","author":"Decrypt / Shuyao Kong"},

Why not Coinbase, then?\nAccording to CEO Brian Armstrong, it’s not simply a matter of preference. Appearing on the What Bitcoin Did podcast this week (via U.Today), Armstrong made that very clear to host Peter McCormack: “I would personally like to list it,” he affirmed.\nHowever, Armstrong suggested that US regulators are uncomfortable with privacy-centric coins. While the government hasn’t made any sort of proclamations as to coming enforcement or issues with Monero or other coins, Armstrong said that a mix of conversations with regulators and internal risk assessments has kept them away—for now, at least.\n“A lot of it is behind-the-scenes conversations where [regulators] are kind of saying: ‘We very much don’t think you should do this,’” Armstrong recalled. “And then we have the conversation: ‘Well, are you telling us that you don’t like it, or are you telling us that you are going to sue us if we do it?’”\nAccording to Armstrong, legal disputes with regulators are part and parcel with being a financial services business, and it’s something they’re willing to engage in at times. However, it can be costly, and they’re not looking to pick every pricey fight that comes their way.\n“It’s kind of just part of doing business, but it’s expensive. And it harms the relationship, right? So you need to kind of pick your battles,” he said. Sometimes, the internal calculus suggests that it’s better off not engaging. “We don’t know if this is a hill we want to die on, and we have to make a lot of tough calls like that,” Armstrong added.\nArmstrong believes that regulators will become more comfortable with privacy coins over time, much as they did with Bitcoin—which he now said is “like GE stock or something: it’s the most tried and true thing.” But while other exchanges might be willing to list Monero and similar coins, he said Coinbase is being a little more careful and keeping its eye on the future.\n“Compared to some of the other exchanges out there that are probably being a bit more aggressive, we have a little bit more of a conservative approach,” he said. “I want us to be a company that stands the test of time and doesn’t get taken out by some kind of enforcement action, or a cascade of events. I’m playing for the long term here.”\nArmstrong covered many topics over the course of the nearly two-hour conversation with McCormick, including admitting that Coinbase’s acquisition of blockchain analytics platform Neutrino was “a mistake” and one they didn’t do enough cultural diligence on.\n","create_date":"2020-07-25T13:26:50","tag":"monero,Listing,Blockchain,coinbase,crypto","author":"Decrypt / Andrew Hayward"},

But while this is good for those who use it, it makes it harder for exchanges to track what’s going on—a legal requirement.\nLast week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said he would like to list Monero but added that the exchange is too concerned with regulators to do so. And with other exchanges in the same boat, the adoption of privacy coins has slowed right down. But, if this whitepaper is successful, it could start to turn things around.\nOf course it can satisfy traceability requirements. It is fully compliant with legislation through functionality like viewkeys and tx keys.

Period.”\nSo far, Monero has been delisted from five crypto exchanges, including Bithumb and Huobi Korea.

Currently, ARB has recovered some of its losses and is trading at $0.782, at par with yesterday’s price.\nThe flipping of the two projects’ market caps occurred due to considerable liquidations of ARB long orders. CoinGlass data shows $2.2 million longs were liquidated on Sept. 11, levels not seen since August’s flash crash.\nThe bullish hype prior to the liquidations can be attributed to PlutusDAO’s introduction of an ARB staking proposal on Sept. 9.\nNotably, the total market caps of Arbitrum and Optimism layer-2s are separated by just $66.9 million, with both holding around $1 billion.\nThe number of transactions and daily addresses interacting on Arbirum and Optimism has remained consistent since the start of September, with Aribtrum total transacting continuing to lead Optimism, according to a Dune dashboard by pseudonymous data analyst @mslib7.\nIt suggests that the price surge was primarily due to the futures liquations.\nOptimism’s transactions briefly outpaced Arbitrium during the hype around the launch of global ID project Worldcoin, which is built atop Optimism's infrastructure.

There are a wealth of wallet options, depending on your requirements.","title":"How To Keep Your Bitcoin Safe And Secure - Decrypt","content":" Keeping your Bitcoin safe might seem like a simple task, but as a myriad of thefts, phishing attacks, and exchange hacks prove—it's easier said than done.\nThe majority of Bitcoin holders use one of four main types of cryptocurrency wallet: hardware, software, metal, and exchange wallets. Some are better than others for keeping your Bitcoin safe, but there are many ways to maximize your security regardless of which option you choose.\nWhen it comes to keeping your Bitcoin private keys secure, hardware wallets are widely considered to be the safest option. Hardware wallets are physical security vaults that are designed to protect your Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) from a range of possible attacks, while also ensuring you can access and spend your cryptocurrencies with relative ease.\nHardware wallets vary considerably in form, function, and price. They range from the $49 KeepKey wallet, to the $119 Bluetooth multi-asset Ledger Nano X, and $120 Bitcoin-centric Coldcard Mk3 and beyond.\nLike most cryptocurrency wallets, hardware wallets use a mnemonic phrase that can be used to recover your wallet; this can be used in the event that the device itself is lost. It's also one of the biggest vulnerabilities for hardware wallets, since anybody who gets their hands on the recovery phrase will have unfettered access to the funds it contains.\nThis has led to some ingenious workarounds to protect and secure the recovery phrase from prying eyes, including writing it in UV-sensitive ink under a dummy phrase, and even dividing the recovery phrase up between several safety deposit boxes.\nSoftware wallets are one of the most popular ways to store Bitcoin among mobile users, since many can be used to manage a wide variety of cryptocurrencies from most mobile devices. There are also desktop versions of many software wallets, allowing users to manage their own private keys on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\nSome of the most popular Bitcoin wallets are software wallets, including Electrum, Jaxx Liberty, and Exodus—all of which are available for both desktop and mobile operating systems. However, even the most secure options lack some of the security features of hardware wallets.\nIn order to maximize your security with a software wallet, we recommend picking one that features two-factor authentication (2FA). It's also important to ensure you're protected against viruses, keyloggers, and other malware, since these can exfiltrate your private keys and seed phrases if not blocked.\nAs the name suggests, mobile Bitcoin wallets are downloadable apps that can be used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies on a smartphone.\nThese can generally be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, but sometimes need to be manually installed as an APK (on Android) or through sideloading (on iOS)—particularly for newer wallets that haven’t yet been approved for app stores.\nMobile wallets can vary considerably in the features they offer, but they generally take advantage of the unique capabilities of smartphones—such as fingerprint sensors, cameras, GPS, etc., to add an additional layer of security.\nMany of these wallets feature support for multiple cryptocurrencies, while others support just one. In most cases, mobile wallets are considered ‘non-custodial’, which means you maintain control of your private keys.\nSome of the most popular multi-asset mobile wallets and their main features include:\nIt’s important to note that while some software wallets are also mobile wallets, not all mobile wallets are software wallets—since software wallets are usually available across a range of operating systems, often including mobile ones like iOS and Android.\nMetal wallets are physical metal plates or devices that can be used to securely store recovery phrases, private keys, and potentially other sensitive information offline. Since they're constructed out of metal, they are inherently fireproof and corrosion-resistant, while some, like the Cryptosteel and Cypherwheel, are also crush-resistant.\nUnlike the other options on this list, metal wallets are not designed for actually using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. They simply act as a means to store secret information in a more robust way than an insecure paper wallet. They're more resilient than even the most robust hardware wallets, and several feature built-in anti-tamper mechanisms. They're most useful for long-term storage in a secure location, since they won't afford you instant access to your funds.\nA wide range of metal wallets are available, ranging from between $20 to over $200—or you can go the DIY route to make one yourself.\nCryptocurrency exchanges have much to recommend them, including instant access to funds, plus the ability to quickly trade your Bitcoin for other cryptoassets. However, compared to other methods of storing your Bitcoin, they are generally considered to be a less secure option. Between 2011 and 2020, $11 billion was stolen in crypto hacking incidents, with a \"significant amount\" lost in hacks of crypto exchanges, according to research by Inside Bitcoins.\nExchanges are also custodial, which means they hold custody of any fund stored in their accounts, leaving users without access to their private keys. \"Not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" is a common refrain among those cryptocurrency advocates who reject the idea of storing their crypto on an exchange. Of course, it's worth noting that many exchanges, including the major ones such as Gemini, Coinbase and Bittrex, are insured—protecting users against a range of threats including insider theft and cyberattacks.\nDespite their limitations, exchanges remain an extremely popular way to store cryptocurrencies, due to the simple fact that they're typically convenient and easy to use.\nThey also differ in their security stack, including their use of cold storage and account-side security features. We'd recommend sticking to exchanges that use multi-signature cold storage and offer two-factor authentication for accounts. Some exchanges, such as Binance, also let you use a hardware key for 2FA, adding an additional layer of security.\n","create_date":"2021-01-18T16:00:27","tag":"ledger,gemini,exchange,paper wallet,bitcoin exchange,bitcoin hardware wallet,metal wallet,coinbase","author":"Decrypt / Daniel Phillips"},

But Plotvinov is keenly aware that in crypto, phenomena like Notcoin can only ride forward momentum for so long.\n“You cannot build a viral thing that just grows forever,” he said.\nSo the developer and his team of four fellow engineers are now racing to leverage Notcoin’s success into a larger and more sustainable enterprise—one that effectively serves as a launchpad for other, independent developers to create their own “viral, funny, entertaining, competitive social crypto games,” tapping into the infrastructure and audience that Open Builders already has at its disposal.\nA crucial component of Notcoin are “squads,” teams of players brought together by an incentivized referral program. Plotvinov says there are over 30,000 such teams already involved with Notcoin—which could easily be onboarded into a new game. And that's on top of the 35 million total players who checked out Notcoin during its \"mining phase\" earlier this year.\n“We already bonded together in Notcoin,” the developer said. “And now Notcoin says the next adventure is coming. One click and you’re already in the same squad, you have your achievements, and you have your reputation.”\nPlotvinov envisions the future of Notcoin as a Netflix-like environment of playable games and social experiences in which users can jump from one experience to the next, all while taking data and connections with them.

Then another account was created on crypto exchange Huobi, two days later, again according to VG.\nA sum of privacy coin Dash was sent to the Huobi account, which was then exchanged for Bitcoin on July 10.\nMonths later, on October 31, Anne-Elisabeth Hagen was taken from her home in Norway and reported as kidnapped by her husband, Tom Hagen, who found the ransom letter on the same day Anne-Elisabeth disappeared.\nThe Guardian reported that police arrested Tom Hagen in April 2020 on suspicion of murder; Anne-Elisabeth remains missing.\nLaw enforcement organizations around the world have devoted considerable effort to tracking cryptocurrency transactions, including privacy coins.\nIn July 2020, a leaked FBI intelligence report revealed how the FBI had tracked dark web criminals laundering dirty Bitcoin by converting it into Monero. Later that year, crypto intelligence firm CipherTrace announced that it had developed a toolset for tracing Monero transactions, although CEO Dave Jevans conceded that \"You can’t be as deterministic as Bitcoin […] In tracing Monero, it’s really more of a probabilistic game.\"\nIn January 2020, Europol's European Cybercrime Centre noted that one suspect had used a combination of Monero and the privacy browser Tor to render their transactions untraceable.\nWhile the cat-and-mouse game between cybercriminals and law enforcement continues, regulators have turned their attention to exchanges. As a result of \"behind-the-scenes conversations\" with regulators, crypto exchange Coinbase has held back on listing Monero; last year, Monero developers and privacy protocol Tari Labs released a whitepaper to let exchanges know how they can list the cryptocurrency while retaining regulatory compliance.\n","create_date":"2021-05-26T10:02:58","tag":"monero,Norway,Breaking Push,crime,Dash,xmr","author":"Decrypt / Scott Chipolina"},

She said the bank hoped to open its doors to the crypto world by 2021.\n“Avanti plans to serve as a compliant bridge to the US dollar payments system and a custodian of digital assets that can meet the strictest level of institutional custody standards,” the company announced on its webpage. Long cited on Twitter that “a custodian doesn’t yet exist” that meets high fiduciary standards for institutional investors that want to enter crypto markets.\n\"For various regulatory reasons, existing US banks & trust companies can’t provide optimal services to #crypto,\" she tweeted. \"Avanti plans to break that logjam & thereby help keep the US from falling behind other countries whose regulated banks are already serving institutions in this mkt.\"\nAvanti would operate as a Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI), a designation which the Wyoming Legislature enacted last year that would allow new crypto startups to act as custody banks. Long pointed to the strict regulation requirements of SPDIs and high capital needs as a reasons why they will be the first company to attempt to create a crypto bank in the state.\n1/ INTRODUCING AVANTI BANK, a new US #bank to serve #digitalasset industry, offering new products & svcs not currently available in USD mkts along w/ tech partner @Blockstream. #Wyoming-based.

This means service providers can’t lend out their assets, and consumers would receive their assets back immediately if the bank goes bust.\nA partnership with Blockstream will focus on Bitcoin applications, software and hardware, according to Coindesk. But Long clarified on Twitter that Avanti will also provide services for other cryptocurrencies and digital assets. She also said the company will comply with all federal know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML), counter terrorist financing laws.\nAvanti is currently working on filing its charter application and is slated to open its doors early next year.\n","create_date":"2020-02-24T19:57:57","tag":"banking,cryptocurrency,cryptocurrency regulation,Wyoming","author":"Decrypt / Frank Cardona"},

Antonopoulos (@aantonop) January 15, 2021\n\nAs Decrypt reported in late December, over a million customer emails were stolen from Ledger and made publicly available on a hacker site. Shortly after the hack, some Ledger owners began receiving threatening Bitcoin ransom emails. But it looks like malicious actors decided to take it one step further and are resorting to actual phone calls.\n“This is a new and more high-touch high-effort attack which is similar to the ‘Windows tech support’ scams that are run out of call centers in low-labor-cost countries,” Antonopoulos tweeted, adding, “While I had previously heard about social engineering attacks via email and SMS, I had not heard about these voice calls. It appears many have been receiving them for weeks.”\nAfter the hack, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier told Decrypt that users who had their addresses leaked should not need to move house because scammers were more likely to run lower-cost phishing attacks, such as spoof emails or threatening messages. He also said that the firm won't be providing any compensation to those who had their data leaked.\nAfter inviting other Ledger users to report similar suspicious calls, Antonopoulos later revealed that he received information about dozens of such interactions, with calls appearing to originate from all over Europe, including the UK, Sweden, and Germany.\nI can only confirm.

You must make ABSOLUTELY SURE you have removed it from everywhere before you switch,” he wrote.\nThis is the idea that the scammers could take ownership of your old number and then use that to pass two-factor authentication that relies on the mobile number—which would be an easy way to lose money.\n","create_date":"2021-01-15T16:35:52","tag":"ledger,hacks,hardware wallets,scammers,phishing","author":"Decrypt / Liam Frost"},

The announcement added that, \"More detailed personal information could have been exposed.\"\nA researcher participating in Ledger’s bug bounty program flagged the issue initially on July 14.

Nearly 15,000 people marched to protest government plans for a \"stand-alone Internet,\" a heavily monitored, gated Internet, akin to China's Great Firewall. Some protestors brandished paper airplanes—the icon of the popular messaging app and crypto conclave, Telegram, which was founded by Durov, who is revered throughout Russia. It’s his encrypted technology that is making it possible for rally organizers to operate with impunity.\nOne demonstrator at today’s protest for internet freedom is holding up a holy “icon” of Pavel Durov, the creator of #Telegram. Russia’s media watchdog has tried unsuccessfully to block it for not giving up its encryption keys to the security services. pic.twitter.com/IcFz3pBPMH\n— Emily Sherwin (@EmilyCSherwin) March 10, 2019\n\n\"Telegram is the last remaining secure messenger available to Russians today and it’s been under assault from the government for the past year,” says Mikhail Svetov, a spokesman for protest organizers, the Russian Libertarian Party, who spoke to Decrypt via Telegram (what else?) from Moscow.\nTelegram, says Svetov, is used by “pretty much everyone in Russia. Putin set to ban it last year, but failed, thanks to Pavel. He’s been pro-active in resisting censorship and created a clever system of changing IP addresses that currently outsmarts the government ban.”\nBut now the government has plans to do much more than ban Telegram, it’s seeking to sever Russia from the Internet itself. The second reading of the draft law on an “autonomous Internet” will take place in the Russian state parliament, the Duma this week.\nIf passed, only upper house approval and President Vladimir Putin’s signature stand between plans to cut off the country’s Internet from the outside world, with traffic routed through state controlled channels. In February, the BBC suggested that authorities were planning a test run as early as this spring. This has since been denied by officials and industry executives, but Durov’s Telegram is red hot with rumors and plans for revolt. He has openly supported the protests.\nThe repercussions of Russia’s meddling will also be felt much further afield. According to expert opinion, unplugging Russia form the Internet, even if only temporarily, could destablize the wider Internet, and also impact the mining of both bitcoin and Ethereum, if Russia’s ill-advised “test” were to go ahead.\nLittle wonder then that a nationwide Internet shutdown, with only a state-controlled intranet as back-up, has sparked fears for Russia’s miners. According to Bitnodes, around three percent of all nodes are located in Russia. They are key components of blockchain technology, processing transactions and maintaining the distributed ledger. While three percent seems a small proportion, it’s enough to upend a system. Yet, aside from Durov, node owners and blockchain-based startups have been slow to overtly take any concrete action to avert the catastrophe.\nDurov rose to fame in Russia after setting up a social network Vkontakte, shortly after Facebook was launched. Within a few years it became the most popular social network in Russia and Durov was dubbed the Russian Mark Zuckerberg. But then he fell afoul of the authorities through refusing to hand over the company's encryption keys to the security services. There was little alternative but to either bow to demands or flee abroad. He chose the latter and went onto found Telegram while based in Dubai. It raised $1.7 billion in a token sale in April, 2018.\nUnlike investors, Russia’s main security agency, the FSB (a successor to the KGB) was not impressed. It branded Telegram the messenger of choice for \"international terrorist organizations in Russia.” And has not let up on its attempts to ban the app since.\nBut these have somewhat backfired. Russians make up only seven percent of Telegram’s 200 million plus user base, but it’s a very resourceful seven percent. Russian users quickly adapted to the authorities’ ban and continue to access Telegram through VPNs, or virtual private networks.\nIn fact, reports suggest that attempts to block Telegram have actually encouraged more Russians to start using VPNs, and they’re now accessed by a broader section of the population, which even includes the country’s babushkas (grandmothers.) Private networks also provide access to the 80,000 sites that are currently government-blacklisted, an added bonus for those who have taken the time to instal them. The Russian authorities must be seething.\nOf course, the government strenuously denies that its seeking to curtail any of its citizens’ liberties. The bill, it says, is aimed at improving cyber-security through a national domain name system which will allow the Internet to continue functioning even if the country is cut off from foreign infrastructure.\nNot so, says Svetov. “The government is trying to build the same kind of firewall that China has, to ban Telegram for good. If they succeed, it will break the Internet as we know it.”\n“Durov is the only one who’s been proactive in resisting the government ban,” says Svetov. “Other companies just leave the market altogether, or cooperate and disclose their keys. He did neither and that makes him very special. Pavel is very popular. He’s one of the very few self-made billionaires Russia has. Everyone else is a crook.”\nA well-known libertarian speaker and vlogger, Svetov received a political science degree from the UK’s Nottingham University and then worked abroad before returning to Moscow in 2016. His YouTube channel, where he discusses the social and political topics of the day, has garnered more than 100,000 subscribers.\nThe Russian authorities are used to controlling TV channels to spread propaganda. When Putin came to power in 2000, only two percent of the population used the Internet. Now, that figure is almost 75 percent and YouTube has become an increasingly popular tool among opposition activists. The platform is viewed by 82 percent of the Russian population aged 18-44.\nIn April 2018, it was the Libertarians who mobilized 12,000 people to attend Moscow’s protest for Internet freedom and against the Telegram ban.\nDurov, in recognition of their efforts and the plight of Russian citizens, continues to switch servers to evade government interference. But he’s also been busy working on the Telegram mainnet and the token, dubbed GRAM, for his startup’s blockchain-based Telegram Open Network (TON) platform. It’s due for release as early as this month and keenly anticipated.\nBut the prognosis for Russian-based libertarians isn’t quite so good. Svetov told us that he lives in constant fear. “Russia is very tough on opposition. Many of my friends were forced to leave the country. I was attacked twice last year and then I was put in jail for 10 days. So I’m prepared for something bad to happen, but someone has to fight for the cause.”\nSaint Pavel will be at his side. Or Durov’s portrait will be, at least.\n","create_date":"2019-03-13T16:00:50","tag":"INTERNET,russia,politics,Durov,Telegram","author":"Decrypt / Adriana Hamacher"},

Now that haul is worth millions of dollars—and Durov says he’s holding for a potential 100x gain.\nMore than 552,000 players of Notcoin donated a share of their in-game coins to Durov back in February, part of an effort by the Notcoin team—called Open Builders—to thank the Telegram founder for the messaging app that houses the crypto game.\nUltimately, Durov ended up with over 1.03 billion NOT tokens, or just over 1% of the total Notcoin supply on The Open Network (TON). That’s worth about $7.3 million as of this writing, but was a bit lower at $6.8 million when Durov posted earlier Friday.\nDurov, who’s estimated to have a $15.5 billion fortune by Forbes, hardly needs the cash. And he’s not selling. But should the NOT token surge in value, he says he’d sell them to ultimately better support Telegram.\n1,030,383,291.36 Notcoin ($6.8M USD) were sent as donation to Pavel Durov and Telegram.\nThanks for everything you guys built.https://t.co/ZaBgB22yyg pic.twitter.com/8gmNjbBs3s\n— Notcoin Ø (@thenotcoin) May 17, 2024\n\n“Half a million Notcoin users gifted me $6.8 million worth of Notcoin! Thank you,” Durov wrote on Telegram. “I will hold these coins until they turn to $680 million, at which point I will use them to buy more servers for Telegram.”\nNotcoin is this year’s biggest gaming token launch so far, debuting at a market cap of nearly $1.5 billion early Thursday. New cryptocurrencies are often volatile, and indeed, NOT has plunged in value since the debut—dropping by 50% to a current price just above $0.007, according to CoinMarketCap.\nEven so, NOT is the 101st most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap at $746 million, and racked up more than $1 billion worth of trading volume in its first 24 hours after launch.\nNotcoin paused its coin-tapping gameplay in April to prepare for the token rollout, but it set to relaunch its crypto-earning game—and ultimately serve as a platform for additional games in an effort to become the “Netflix of social, viral games,” co-creator Sasha Plotvinov told Decrypt’s GG in April.\n","create_date":"2024-05-17T20:11:25","tag":"Gaming,not,Pavel Durov,Telegram,video games,the open network,Notcoin","author":"Decrypt / Andrew Hayward"}
