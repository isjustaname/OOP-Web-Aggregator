In a tweet on Thursday, Binance US stated that its banking partners are getting ready to halt dollar withdrawal services, possibly starting from June 13.\nThe SEC has taken to using extremely aggressive and intimidating tactics in its pursuit of an ideological campaign against the American digital asset industry. https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS and our business partners have not been spared in the use of these tactics, which has created… pic.twitter.com/rlIe6swIoY\nOn Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took legal action against Binance, its CEO and founder Changpeng Zhao, and the operator of Binance US. This move represents a significant escalation in the regulatory crackdown on the digital asset industry by U.S. authorities. The SEC also filed a lawsuit against the prominent U.S. exchange Coinbase the following day.\nIn a customer notice posted on Twitter, Binance US announced its decision to discontinue accepting dollar deposits as part of its transition into a “digital-asset-only exchange.” The company expressed its view that the SEC’s civil charges were unwarranted and pledged to “vigorously” defend itself against them.\nOn Monday, the SEC leveled 13 charges against Binance, accusing the company of engaging in a “web of deception.” The allegations included artificially inflating trading volumes, misappropriating customer funds, and failing to enforce restrictions against U.S. customers.\nThe SEC further sought a court order on Tuesday to freeze Binance’s assets in the United States. In response, Binance US referred to the motion as “unwarranted,” asserting that it had already taken steps to address the SEC’s concerns regarding the security of customer assets.\nSEC stated it has not obtained satisfactory reassurance that the assets of Binance US were controlled by its designated operator “BAM Trading.” The regulatory body warns that these assets may be under the control or influence of Binance or its founder, Zhao, who has openly expressed a desire to evade compliance with U.S. laws.\nAccording to the SEC, Zhao and Binance had “free reign” in managing Binance US assets, lacking any oversight or controls to ensure their proper security. The SEC emphasized that this unrestricted control over U.S. investor assets posed significant concerns.\nBinance previously stated its commitment to defend its platform and highlighted that the SEC’s jurisdiction was limited as Binance was not classified as a U.S. exchange.\nAs per the SEC, Binance US currently holds customer assets consisting of more than $2.2 billion in digital assets and approximately $377 million in U.S. dollar bank accounts.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-09-20T18:14:15-04:00","tag":"Regulation","author":"Alex Lari"},

It promised to “make Bitcoin a multi-asset network, but in a scalable manner that upholds Bitcoin’s core values.”\nIn a recent “Built on Bitcoin” interview, Joltz CTO Linden Stark said:\n“The point is… have as small of an on-chain footprint as possible… They’ve seen what BRC-20s are doing and thought to themselves, ‘How can we do this in a way that does not hurt people who are operating nodes, using Bitcoin normally?’”\nBy storing metadata off-chain, Taproot Assets optimizes the use of Bitcoin’s timechain, paving the way for smoother asset transfers. Following its mainnet launch, however, the Taproot Assets protocol typically required the use of the command line.\nJoltz has changed that by launching the world’s first non-custodial wallet supporting Taproot Assets with an easy-to-use interface and an accompanying SDK that makes it easy for developers to add support for Taproot Assets to their applications.\nAnd stablecoins aren’t the only potential use case.\nIn a recent conversation on “Business Bitcoinization” Joltz Co-CEO Ian Major noted that Joltz was beginning to receive in-bound interest from non-Bitcoin companies who wanted to explore user incentives and rewards.\nHe highlighted that these businesses were reaching out because of the attractiveness of having a solution ‘built-on-Bitcoin’. However, jumping straight to bitcoin rewards proved too big a leap for some businesses.\nTaproot Assets would allow for the creation of bitcoin-backed or even stablecoin-backed loyalty points that would be more accessible for pre-coiners and that would pave an easier path for people to accumulate sats.\nMajor also announced that Joltz had signed their first enterprise client, Kilo Club, a gym wanting to provide a membership-specific collectible and a branded loyalty token that is backed by, and convertible into sats.\nThe gym plans to offer this as a benefit to members, who could choose whether or not to opt-in.\nAnother key differentiator for Taproot Assets is its compatibility with the Lightning Network, allowing scalable, low cost transactions that benefit from an existing network effect.\nLightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun recently announced the very first mainnet asset payment on Lightning with additional Lightning-related support coming soon.\nJoltz plans to integrate Lightning support into its wallet and SDK as soon as possible, estimating having support by the middle of this year. In the meantime, users can try the on-chain web wallet today, which will have a mobile and desktop version coming soon.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-05-08T12:28:41-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Bitcoin News"},

In the meantime, total hashrate of the network keeps steadily increasing.\nThe surge in Bitcoin prices throughout the year, coupled with the growing adoption of the Ordinals protocol, has brought enhanced profitability for miners. As a result, miners are actively deploying additional mining machines. These factors collectively contribute to an increase in computing power, ultimately leading to unprecedented levels of mining difficulty.\nTo maintain a consistent block mining time of approximately 10 minutes, bitcoin mining difficulty undergoes automatic adjustments in response to the increasing computational power, known as hashrate, being added to the network. This ensures that the mining process remains stable even as more computing power joins the network.\nThe increasing popularity of the Ordinals protocol has resulted in transaction fees that are much higher than usual. This boost in transaction fees contributes to higher revenue for miners.\nOrdinals introduce additional capabilities to the bitcoin blockchain, including non-fungible tokens, which subsequently lead to a higher volume of transactions. As a result, mining a block becomes more profitable.\nAs the next halving approaches, miners are employing all available resources to mine the remaining blocks, fueled by the anticipation of a price surge following the halving. The remaining days leading up to the halving represent the miners’ sole chance to secure block rewards of 6.25 BTC before they are cut in half.\nAs an increasing number of miners enter the competition to mine the upcoming blocks, the mining difficulty escalates. An increase in the mining difficulty translates into reduced profitability for miners since their chances of successfully mining a block and generating revenue diminish.\nMarathon Digital Holdings, a prominent mining company, observed a decline in their monthly mined bitcoins as the difficulty rose in April. Similarly, Canadian miner Bitfarms (BITF) experienced a loss in the fourth quarter due to the higher difficulty level.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-06-15T23:49:35-04:00","tag":"Mining","author":"Alex Lari"},

One of the focal points of his concerns is the handling of individuals like Sam Bankman-Fried and his parents, whom he called “criminal beneficiaries, profiteers, conspirators and enablers.”\nThe parents of #SBF were experts on Tax and legal Ethics who advised and received benefits and the idea that they were unaware these activities could be considered illegal or unethical is ridiculous. The #SEC has nothing to do with criminal activities and #DOJ should have…\nJohn Reed Stark, with almost two decades of SEC experience in Division of Enforcement, observes “extraordinary dearth” in DOJ prosecutions despite the SEC’s active enforcement actions. He explained that the SEC is merely a civil enforcement agency and can only impose so much restraint. He added:\n“Until crypto-grifters face the threat of DOJ prosecution (i.e. prison time), they will continue to treat SEC enforcement-related risks (like injunctions, penalties and disgorgement) as the cost of regulatory arbitrage and just another liability item on their balance sheets.”\nHe specifically questioned why the founders of FTX, like SBF, are not being named as defendants in both DOJ and SEC cases. According to him, this draws a visible contrast between the SEC’s frequent enforcement actions and the DOJ’s limited criminal investigations and prosecutions in the digital assets space.\nStark pointed out that Gemini head Tyler Winklevoss had brushed aside SEC allegations, likening them to “manufactured parking tickets.” On the other hand, big exchanges like Coinbase and Binance regard these charges as “badges of honor.”\nRecent reports reveal the DoJ’s consideration of pressing fraud charges against Binance. However, federal prosecutors are concerned about potential consequences like market turbulence and harm to consumers following an indictment. Therefore, they are reportedly exploring alternative solutions, such as fines or non-prosecution agreements.\nMeanwhile, the DoJ is restructuring its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) to handle the rising number of crypto-related cases. Notably, the department is planning to make NCET a permanent unit in the criminal division focusing on computer-related crimes.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-09-29T20:21:07-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

As a result, he strongly advises investors to withdraw their funds from all these exchanges.\nDrawing upon his extensive 19-year collaboration with the SEC, Stark expressed his belief that the regulatory actions taken against Coinbase and Binance could mark the beginning of a broader digital assets regulatory “siege” that may encompass other companies within the industry. Providing further insight, Stark elaborated on his perspective:\nGet out of crypto platforms now, I can’t say it any plainer. I believe that we now know for certain that crypto trading platforms are under a U.S. regulatory/law enforcement siege which has only just begun.\nGet out of crypto platforms now, I can't say it any plainer.

However, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong responded to the SEC lawsuit by refuting the notion that the company could register its activities, citing multiple conversations with the organization.\nArmstrong recently expressed that there was no viable “path to ‘come in and register'” despite their repeated efforts, leading them to refrain from listing securities.\nSimilarly, lawmakers have joined in the criticism of the SEC’s position on this matter, accusing the institution of neglecting the digital assets industry.\nSenator Cynthia Lummis expressed her dissatisfaction, claiming that the SEC has not adequately facilitated the registration process for digital asset exchanges and has failed to offer sufficient legal guidance to differentiate between securities and commodities.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-27T19:56:30-04:00","tag":"Bitcoin","author":"Alex Lari"},

This fresh FTX bankruptcy news comes as a welcome relief to those affected by the exchange’s downfall.\nAccording to reports from various sources, including court filings and statements from FTX itself, the exchange has amassed enough funds to cover the losses incurred by its customers.\nEstimates suggest that FTX owes creditors around $11 billion, but the company has between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion to distribute, leaving a surplus even after full repayments.\nFTX CEO John J. Ray III expressed satisfaction with the proposed repayment plan, stating:\n“We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors.”\nThe repayment plan, which is still subject to court approval, outlines that creditors with claims below $50,000 will receive a 118% compensation. This means that almost all customers will not only get their money back but also receive additional funds.\nAttorney Andrew Dietderich said: “The costs and risks of creating a viable exchange from what Mr. Bankman-Fried left in the dumpster were simply too high.”\nHowever, some critics argue that the plan falls short of fairness.\nThey highlight that the compensation is based on the value of assets at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy in 2022, rather than current market prices. Since then, the digital asset markets have seen a significant resurgence, with bitcoin alone rising by nearly 280%.\nMike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed plan, stating, “I understand why the bankruptcy process needs to work this way, but let’s not pretend victims are getting their money back.”\nFTX’s ability to raise funds for repayment is attributed to various factors. The exchange sold off a diverse collection of assets, including venture investments and litigation claims. Notably, FTX managed to monetize assets held by Alameda Research, a sister company central to the exchange’s collapse.\nThe company stated:\n“FTX has achieved this recovery level by monetizing an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets, most of which were proprietary investments held by the Alameda or FTX Ventures businesses, or litigation claims.”\nThe reorganization plan aims for a “centralized distribution,” ensuring that all FTX customers and creditors affected by the collapse receive compensation, regardless of the location of their assets. Repayments are scheduled to occur within 60 days after the plan’s effective date.\nFTX’s collapse in 2022 was marked by fraudulent activities and mismanagement by its executives.\nFounder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on multiple criminal counts related to defrauding customers and investors. The collapse of FTX left many questioning the integrity of the digital asset exchange industry.\nFTX said in a press release:\n“Accordingly, the Debtors have not been able to benefit from the appreciation of these missing tokens during the chapter 11 cases. Instead, the Debtors have had to look to other sources of recoverable value to repay creditors.”\nDespite the challenges, FTX’s current management, led by John J. Ray III, remains committed to addressing the fallout from the exchange’s demise. Ray stated that attempts to relaunch FTX were deemed unfeasible due to high costs and risks involved.\nRay, drawing from his extensive 40-year legal and restructuring background, conveyed astonishment at the lack of corporate controls and reliable financial data, describing it as an unprecedented failure. He emphasized that such circumstances were unheard of even in the context of bankruptcy.\nFormer customers of FTX have criticized the decision not to relaunch the exchange. However, Ray defended the decision, stating that serious investors were unwilling to provide adequate proposals.\nRay added that serious investors were unwilling to offer significant value due to factors like costs, delays, and other considerations. Additionally, there were no substantial bids for intellectual property since the code is outdated and the brand is associated with fraud.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/09/2024","tag":"Exchanges","author":"Alex Lari"},

It stated:\n“To this end, ESMA seeks […] to gather insights on the manner and the extent to which UCITS have gained direct and indirect exposures to certain asset classes that may give rise to divergent interpretations and risk for retail investors (e.g. structured/leveraged loans, catastrophe bonds, emission allowances, commodities, crypto assets, unlisted equities).”\nStakeholders have until August 7 to provide feedback that could lead to significant changes in the investment landscape.\nIf Bitcoin is approved for UCITS, it would provide a breakthrough opportunity for European investors to diversify their investment strategies and gain mainstream access to digital asset investments.\nIn addition to considering Bitcoin’s inclusion, ESMA has sought feedback on how adding specific digital assets to the UCITS framework would be affected by the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation passed in 2023.\nIt’s crucial to note the difference between UCITS and Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which offer direct exposure to bitcoin investment in a regulated manner.\nUnlike ETFs, which solely focus on bitcoin, UCITS investments are poised to adopt a diverse approach, potentially incorporating multiple funds with varying allocations in bitcoin.\nThis approach aligns with existing EU regulations, which prohibit entirely autonomous digital asset-centric investment vehicles.\nAndrea Pantaleo, a lawyer specializing in digital asset regulation and litigation at DLA Piper, believes that the impact of Bitcoin approval for UCITS could be more significant than that of US ETFs. He explains:\n“The impact would be more significant than the US ETFs because there could be plenty of fund compartments interested in investing small percentages of liquidity in crypto-assets.”\nThe enthusiasm for bitcoin-related investment avenues is evident from the rapid accumulation of assets under management (AUM) by US spot ETFs, which totaled $10 billion within just 20 days of their market debut.\nNotably, the process of updating the UCITS eligible assets rules is expected to be lengthy and subject to negotiation. Nonetheless, this move signals the EU’s ongoing efforts to provide a streamlined regulatory framework for managing digital assets within the region.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/11/2024","tag":"Markets","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

BTC soars to a level that was last seen in August, as analysts turn their attention to the weekly close after the price reached $30,233.\nHowever, it experienced a slight dip afterwards. At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $29,500. The market’s volatility is still noticeable, prompting market participants to buzz around the importance of a weekly candle close to confirm the sustainability of the rally.\nKeith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, explained the significance of the 100-week moving average (MA) at $28,627. He stated that investors should monitor whether the weekly candle closes above this MA. Notably, if the next week’s candle remains above this level without any wicks below, it could be a confirmation of a bullish breakout.\nThe new MacBook Pro finally arrived and just in time for me to hop on a plane for a family trip.

For me, BTC will also need to take out prior resistance at $30.5k, $31.5k, and ultimately $33k to call a bull breakout confirmed and validated.”\nOn a similar note, popular bitcoin trader Skew analyzed the low-timeframe (LTF) conditions and noted the possibility of a sweep of late-long positions, potentially offering an entry point before the uptrend resumes. His X post reads:\n“So if this LTF trend breaks, a nice sweep could be a nice entry before higher, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see something like this play out.”\nMeanwhile, another trader, Pentoshi, set a critical support level of $28,900 for bullish investors.\nLooking at a longer timeframe, the trading team at Stockmoney Lizards expressed optimism that the resistance just above $30,000 would soon be overcome. The analysts suggested that significant upside potential is imminent, especially if the United States approves its first Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\nHere are a few combined factors, including regulatory developments, market sentiment, and economic conditions, that contributed to the notable price surge of bitcoin on October 20:\nOne major catalyst behind the recent price surge is the anticipation of the approval of a U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF.\nEarlier this week, Blackrock and Fidelity submitted their updated proposals for the Spot Bitcoin ETF. As the refiling and modifications progress, there’s growing hope for approval. A recent report by Matrixport predicts that the BTC price can surge to $56,000 if Blackrock’s ETF receives the green light from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nNotably, the approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF would provide easier access to bitcoin for institutional and retail investors, thereby boosting demand.\nThe SEC’s decision to withdraw its appeal in the case against Ripple might be another influential factor in the recent BTC price rise. Interestingly, this event had a positive impact on the overall digital asset market. The withdrawal indicates a degree of regulatory clarity and reduced uncertainty, which typically leads to increased investor confidence and capital inflows.\nAnother important factor that could have contributed to the recent price rise is rising inflation. As a decentralized and deflationary asset, Bitcoin is often considered a hedge against inflation. With ongoing inflationary pressures, investors often get attracted to bitcoin to preserve their wealth.\nRelated reading:\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-21T12:32:00-04:00","tag":"Bitcoin","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

However, their unregulated nature has made them a prime target for scammers looking to exploit unsuspecting individuals.\nThe bill, known as H.659, introduces stringent regulations to curb fraudulent activities associated with Bitcoin ATMs.\nAmong its key provisions is a one-year moratorium on the installation of new Bitcoin ATMs in Vermont. This temporary halt aims to provide regulators with the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of existing regulations and implement further safeguards.\nTo mitigate the risk of financial loss for consumers, the legislation imposes a daily transaction limit of $1,000 for each customer. Additionally, it places a cap of 3% on the fees charged by Bitcoin ATM operators, ensuring fair and transparent transactions.\nAccording to Aaron Ferenc, deputy banking commissioner at the Department of Financial Regulation, these measures are designed to “slow down the speeds at which people are being victimized.”\nAt a House Commerce Committee hearing, executives from two Vermont kiosk operators contended that proposed regulations would render their operations unfeasible. Larry Lipka, a senior executive at CoinFlip, also emphasized the high costs of servicing rural areas compared to California’s more favorable fee limits.\nLipka noted:\n“You know, we call them ATMs because that’s what they look like, and they make people comfortable […] But we’re not an ATM. You’re not accessing your own cash. We’re selling you something that you buy voluntarily.”\nReplying to the question “You just said that you call them ATMs, not that they are, so that people are comfortable with that?”, he mentioned, “We have (called them ATMs) in the past […] [Now] we prefer crypto kiosks … because that’s what it actually is. It’s not an ATM because it’s not connected to a bank.”\nWhile some Bitcoin ATM operators have voiced concerns about the potential impact of the regulations on their businesses, lawmakers emphasize the importance of consumer protection.\nSenator Ann Cummings underscores the need to shield Vermonters’ savings, acknowledging the challenges posed by the difficulty in tracking Bitcoin transactions.\nCummings said:\n“This is about protecting Vermonters’ savings […] The difficulty in tracking both cryptocurrency and cash has made ‘Bitcoin ATMs’ a powerful vector for fraud […] Business always says, ‘If you do this to us we will go broke,’”\nShe also acknowledges the complexity of regulating Bitcoin, stating, “This is a whole new world. We probably won’t get it right the first time.”\nHowever, the moratorium on new Bitcoin ATM installations might provide regulators with an opportunity to refine existing measures and address emerging challenges.\nIf signed into law, the bill mandates the Department of Financial Regulation to assess its effectiveness and report back to lawmakers by January 2025. This report will be crucial in shaping future policies and ensuring a balance between innovation and consumer protection in the realm of Bitcoin.\nVermont’s proactive approach to regulating Bitcoin ATMs reflects a growing recognition of the need to address the risks associated with Bitcoin transactions.\nBy implementing measures to protect consumers and combat fraudulent activities, the state aims to foster a safer environment for Bitcoin users.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/08/2024","tag":"Government","author":"Alex Lari"},

Bitcoin infrastructure company Kaminari recently published a report that sheds light on the current state of the Lightning Network’s adoption, highlighting both its potential for broader acceptance and the challenges it faces in the digital asset industry.\nAccording to the report, more than 328 million users now utilize the Bitcoin Lightning Network for payments. This notable expansion is primarily attributed to the integration of the Lightning Network by key players in the digital asset industry.\nBinance, with its 150 million user base, played a pivotal role in this surge by enabling its users to engage in instant and cost-efficient BTC transactions through the Lightning Network.\nAdditionally, other prominent exchanges such as OKX, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Unocoin, along with financial services platforms like CashApp and Exodus, collectively contributed to reaching such a vast user base with Lightning Network accessibility.\nDespite the technological advancements and the surge in interest in decentralized finance, the Lightning Network’s integration into exchanges remains relatively limited. According to the report, out of the 224 active centralized digital asset exchanges, only 14 have embraced the Lightning Network, raising concerns about scalability and user-friendliness, especially for retail users.\n“Exchanges serve as the backbone of the crypto ecosystem, with platforms like Binance, OKX, and Bitstamp boasting millions of users. However, a mere 6% of crypto exchanges currently utilize the Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactions,” noted analysts at Kaminari.\nThe slow adoption rate is attributed to the technical complexities associated with the Lightning Network. However, Kaminari anticipates further developments this year, with Coinbase, boasting a user base of 108 million, expected to join the Lightning Network.\nIt is important to note that while having access to Lightning payments does not guarantee universal adoption, the increased user base enhances the likelihood of broader acceptance.\nThe report also delves into the integration of Lightning Network technology into digital asset wallets, shedding light on the relatively small but growing number of wallets that have incorporated this innovation.\nAmong the over 350 analyzed wallets, only 29, comprising 15 custodial and 14 non-custodial, have integrated Lightning. Notably, only Exodus and BitPay, among the top 10 most popular wallets, have embraced this technology. The report reads:\n“Wallet integration represents a crucial avenue for expanding the Lightning Network’s user base. The findings underscore the substantial room for growth in wallet integration, presenting an opportunity to enhance user accessibility.”\nDespite the challenges, the Lightning Network demonstrates significant potential, particularly in facilitating micro BTC transactions with low fees. As the Bitcoin blockchain continues its robust growth, the Lightning Network’s expanding node count and capacity position it as a viable solution for the market’s future.\nThe report also notes the significance of the integration of stablecoins into the Bitcoin blockchain. The potential transfer of substantial amounts of USDT transactions from Tron and Ethereum to the Lightning Network has the potential to significantly alter the landscape of the stablecoin sector.\nKaminari’s analysts highlighted:\n“If a fraction of Tether transactions migrates to the Lightning Network, it could result in an annual turnover ranging from $257 billion to $514 billion. The introduction of Tether to the Lightning Network could mark a transformative moment, reshaping the stablecoin market landscape.”\nThe Lightning Network’s growth trajectory promises vast opportunities for those who can harness its innovative capabilities. However, the current state of adoption indicates the need for improvements to make the network more accessible and user-friendly for a diverse range of participants.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-01-22T15:26:06-05:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

This surge in applications has propelled the price of bitcoin to reach a 14-month high, surpassing $31,000 on June 23.\nFidelity, the financial firm headquartered in Boston, is part of a consortium that has formed EDX Markets, a digital asset exchange. This consortium includes market makers Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial, retail broker Charles Schwab, and venture capital firms Paradigm and Sequoia Capital.\nIf permission is granted by the SEC, it has the potential to pave the way for a significant influx of institutional funds and possibly attract high-net-worth retail traders into the realm of bitcoin.\nOver the past years, the SEC has consistently turned down numerous applications for spot bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs are investment vehicles that publicly trade and directly mirror the price of bitcoin. Even Fidelity had its application rejected in January 2022, citing concerns regarding potential market manipulation.\nLast June, the SEC also declined the application from Grayscale Investment LLC to transform its prominent Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The SEC stated non-compliance with anti-fraud measures and investor protection standards as the grounds for rejecting the proposal.\nWhat truly captured the attention of many this time was the involvement of BlackRock, as its application for a spot bitcoin ETF is considered a game changer. BlackRock typically pursues ETFs when it has confidence in their approval prospects, making their participation highly significant.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-12T00:03:06-04:00","tag":"Markets","author":"Alex Lari"},

He states:\n“I think that’s probably where we are — certainly for this quarter and maybe next quarter — until either the Fed starts cutting rates because the economy finally slows or we get through the election.”\nNovogratz cited the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and last month’s block reward halving as factors contributing to this price stability.\nRecent statements from the Biden administration have been perceived by the Bitcoin industry as negative for price action. One example being the indication to veto a resolution invalidating the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which requires custodians to report liabilities and corresponding assets on their balance sheets for all the digital assets held.\nMoreover, the recent crackdown on popular Bitcoin privacy services and the arrest of the founders of Bitcoin mixer Samourai Wallet have also forced the bitcoin community to raise concerns about stifling innovation.\nNovogratz criticized the Biden administration’s stance, stating that it appeared to be a rejection of digital assets. He noted that despite there being Democrats who support bitcoin, key figures like Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler have been influential in shaping the party’s negative stance.\nThe recent House of Representatives’ approval to reverse SAB 121, with significant support from Republicans and some Democrats, signals a growing divide. The resolution now moves to the Senate, where Novogratz sees it as a litmus test for Democrats’ digital asset stance.\nNovogratz emphasized the importance of bipartisan cooperation for the bitcoin industry’s success. He highlighted the need for both Republicans’ and Democrats’ support to create a stable regulatory environment. He stated:\n“There was a shift in the Twitter space; there was a shift in people I spoke to […] I think that’s kind of dangerous thinking […] for our industry to thrive, you’re going to need bipartisan support.“\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/16/2024","tag":"Government","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

While the reduction in newly mined bitcoin may lead to a potential shortage, the increasing involvement of ETFs adds another layer of complexity.\nBitcoin long-term holders, also known as “Diamond Hands”, remain optimistic due to their belief in its transformative technology and fixed supply, which they anticipate will drive value appreciation over time.\nThey see Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and view its expanding adoption as a testament to its growing utility. Additionally, the maturation of Bitcoin’s market infrastructure enhances user’s confidence, facilitating easier access and fostering a more robust ecosystem for long-term growth.\nWallets that HODL bitcoin are in a consistent upward trend despite price action, holding more than 50% of the current bitcoin circulating supply.\nMicroStrategy, spearheaded by CEO Michael Saylor, has initiated the new year with a robust surge in bitcoin acquisitions. In January 2024 alone, the company bolstered its holdings with the purchase of 850 bitcoin.\nThe consistent pattern of bitcoin acquisitions indicates that Saylor and MicroStrategy are consistently adding to their holdings every month, occasionally with brief intervals of one or two months between purchases. Currently, MicroStrategy holds 190,000 bitcoin as Michael Saylor reported on his X account.\nIn January, @MicroStrategy acquired an additional 850 BTC for $37.2 million and now holds 190,000 BTC. Please join us at 5pm ET as we discuss our Q4 2023 financial results and answer questions about our #bitcoin strategy and business outlook. $MSTR https://t.co/j5SbcELsue\nNation states are also buying bitcoin for their reserves. Countries like El Salvador disclose their buy marks and holdings. El Salvador now possesses 2,762 bitcoin as Forbes reports.\nOther Small countries like Montenegro are in the works for having bitcoin in their reserves.\nBitcoin Halving is an event programmed into the Bitcoin protocol that occurs approximately every four years or 210,000 blocks. During this event, the reward that miners receive for confirming transactions and securing the network is halved.\nThis reduction in rewards ultimately decreases the rate at which new bitcoin is created, enforcing scarcity. The purpose of the Bitcoin Halving is to control the inflation rate of Bitcoin and ensure that the total supply remains limited to 21 million, making it a deflationary asset over time.\nBefore the halving event, around 900 bitcoin will be mined each day. Following the halving, this rate decreased to about 450 bitcoin mined daily. Based on these figures, it’s estimated that after April 20th, 2024, approximately 114,750 bitcoin will be mined each year, or around 14,343 bitcoin each month until the next halving, expected by 2028.\nA Bitcoin ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is a type of investment fund that tracks the price of bitcoin and allows individuals and institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without needing to own or store it themselves directly. Instead, users can buy shares of the ETF, representing ownership of the underlying bitcoin held by the fund.\nThe current landscape of the Bitcoin market is witnessing significant shifts, with Bitcoin ETFs holding a total of 726,090 bitcoin at present. Concurrently, there are substantial outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), dispersing its bitcoin holdings among other ETFs.\nInvestment researcher and founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, Lyn Alden, shared her insights on the potential implications of a Bitcoin ETF during an interview on the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast. Alden delved into the multifaceted impacts that a Bitcoin ETF could have on the market and beyond.\nApproximately 1.85 Million bitcoin are held on exchanges, as reported by CoinGlass. This confluence of factors, including the involvement of large companies, nation-states, long-term holders, the halving mechanism, and the surge in ETF activity, presents a perfect storm scenario for a severe bitcoin shortage.\nAs larger entities such as ETFs continue their aggressive purchasing spree, there’s a looming risk of scarcity for other major players in the industry. Exchanges may resort to limiting withdrawals or imposing significantly higher fees to manage the strain on available bitcoin reserves. Consequently, smaller exchanges might find themselves priced out of the market due to the dwindling circulation of bitcoin.\nAs the bull market drives up on-chain bitcoin fees, the shortage could worsen for smaller retailers and individuals. This underscores the critical importance of layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which can alleviate congestion on the Bitcoin network and facilitate more efficient and cost-effective transactions.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-02-22T13:10:57-05:00","tag":"ETF","author":"Luis Lopez"},

Oklahoma legislators recently passed a bill underscoring the state’s proactive stance in embracing Bitcoin as a technology while addressing regulatory challenges.\nIn response to growing regulatory attention from the Federal Government, Oklahoma lawmakers have enacted legislations aimed at protecting citizens’ ability to own and transact with bitcoin.\nSponsored by Rep. Brian Hill and Senator Bill Coleman, this significant bill upholds individuals’ rights to self-custody their digital assets, engage in the mining of the digital asset, operate full nodes, and conduct digital asset trading activities.\nDennis Porter, founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, emphasizes the importance of this legislative initiative, stating:\n“Without the ability to manage our own wealth and assets, we are no longer in control of our own destiny. We are no longer able to forge a better path for ourselves and our families. This is why it is critical to ensure that Americans (and all people of the world) are able to secure not only their Bitcoin but ALL their assets.”\nNotably, several other states have also introduced similar legislations, including Ohio, Virginia and Nebraska.\nOne key aspect of the legislation is its support for Bitcoin mining, which is seen as a means to utilize surplus energy resources, promote environmental sustainability, attract local investments, and create job opportunities.\nOklahoma’s abundant energy resources, including wind farms, provide a lucrative avenue for mining operations.\nBy allowing BTC mining to utilize excess energy, Oklahoma aims to not only promote environmental sustainability but also boost the local economy. This initiative encourages investment in local electrical infrastructure, particularly benefiting rural communities and bolstering employment opportunities.\nDespite Oklahoma’s proactive stance, the broader landscape of Bitcoin regulation in the United States remains fraught with challenges.\nRecent regulatory actions, including measures against entities like Samourai Wallet and calls for stricter regulations by figures such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, highlight the ongoing volatility and regulatory scrutiny facing the sector.\nOklahoma’s legislative advancements in Bitcoin regulation and mining reflect a significant step towards integrating digital asset security within legal frameworks. While this marks a promising development for the digital asset proponents, ongoing regulatory uncertainties suggest that vigilance and strategic planning will be crucial for navigating future challenges in this dynamic sector.\nIn conclusion, Oklahoma’s proactive stance in protecting bitcoin ownership rights contrasts with federal regulatory scrutiny, signaling a positive move towards legitimizing and safeguarding digital asset activities. As other states consider similar measures, the implications of Oklahoma’s legislative initiatives extend beyond its borders, shaping the future landscape of the digital asset regulation in the United States.\nBy taking bold steps to embrace Bitcoin as a technology while addressing regulatory challenges, Oklahoma sets an example for other states to follow in safeguarding citizens’ rights to participate in the burgeoning digital economy.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"04/29/2024","tag":"Freedom","author":"Alex Lari"},

Key insights revealed from the analysis include:\nForm 13F filings are quarterly reports required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for large institutional investment managers with assets over $100M. These filings provide a detailed account of the securities held by major institutional investors.\nThe form must be filed within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter via the SEC’s EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system. For Q1 (ending March 31), the filing deadline was May 15, which just passed, and the reports are in. Let us take a look.\nOur database of 13F filings includes 782 entities reporting on 192M shares of the 10 Bitcoin ETFs worth $9.7B.\nBelow, we show the frequency statistics by ETF Ticker. Unsurprisingly, the largest reported holdings (red box below) belong to Grayscale’s $GBTC (almost $4B), Blackrock’s $IBIT (nearly $3B), and Fidelity’s $FBTC ($2B+).\nThe figure below shows the largest ETF holders by total holdings.\nMillennium, Horizon Kinetics, Schonfeld Strategic, Booth Bay, and Morgan Stanley are the top five, excluding Susquehanna and Jane Street Group, who are also market makers and liquidity providers. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board is also high on the above list. Let’s dive deeper into the top 6 holders:\nMillennium Management is one of the largest and most successful hedge funds globally. Its AUM is over $64B, and it has more than 5,600 employees.\nThey had previously invested in Bitcoin futures and (unfortunately) other crypto related products. They hold almost $2B of spot Bitcoin ETF products, representing a ~3% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin.\nHorizon Kinetics is a private investment advisory firm that provides portfolio management and consulting services to individuals, high-net-worth individuals, trusts, and estates. According to recent reports, it manages approximately $7 billion in assets. The firm’s investment philosophy is long-term and value-driven.\nThey view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a non-correlated asset. In a 2022 blog post, Murray Stahl, the firm’s co-founder, wrote: “The future bitcoin return should be genuinely extraordinary.” They now own nearly $1B of Bitcoin ETFs, a 14% portfolio allocation!\nSchonfeld Strategic Advisors is a private multi-manager platform hedge fund. They, too, have a long-term focus and offer fundamentals-driven strategies while also managing tactical funds.\nInterestingly, one of their key company principles is patience and long-term horizon. Schonfeld manages approximately $13.8B (as of 2023) in assets and hires around 1000 employees. They reported owning $408M worth of bitcoin, which is a 3% portfolio allocation!\nBoothbay Fund Management is a multi-strategy hedge fund manager founded by Ari Glass in 2011. The firm invests in a broad set of areas, including equities, fixed income, and credit.\nBoothbay is more of a flexible and opportunistic player than a long-term investor, seeking to capitalize on market dislocations and inefficiencies.\nThey have been active in employing digital-asset arbitrage strategies for several years now. They oversee around $4B in assets and now own $377M worth of Bitcoin ETFs, a 9.4% total portfolio allocation.\nMorgan Stanley is a leading investment banking and wealth management provider. It manages a portfolio of approximately $1.5 trillion in assets. In 2021, the firm allowed its wealth management clients access to three Bitcoin funds, marking a major step for the organization.\nTheir CEO, James Gorman, recently made cautiously optimistic remarks: “Bitcoin is not going away. It’s not a fad. I just don’t think it’s a core investment. I think it’s a speculative asset of which there are plenty of choices.”\nThey now hold $272M worth of Bitcoin ETFs, which is small compared to the company’s total AUM but aligns with its traditionally cautious stance.\nThe State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) is a public pension fund responsible for managing the assets of the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and several other state trust funds established in 1951.\nSWIB oversees approximately $156B in assets and reports owning $163M worth of Bitcoin ETFs, which is a 0.1% total portfolio allocation.\nFor a pension fund, this is a good start. Their recent 13F filings indicate that their investment (non-cash) portfolio is valued at $37B, which makes their bitcoin allocation 0.44% of the investment portfolio.\nThe latest 13F filings show that very well capitalized institutions are beginning allocating to bitcoin. Giant hedge funds, investment banking providers, and pension funds are among those on the list.\nTogether, they’ve invested nearly $10B, which points to growing confidence in Bitcoin as a reputable asset class.\nOnce Bitcoin enters institutional portfolios, it is unlikely to leave given how quickly Bitcoin’s price appreciates. This is exacerbated in a slow growth environment where ever-growing national debt threatens to continue debasing the price of money over the long run.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-05-17T09:21:42-04:00","tag":"Asset Protection","author":"Sina"},

Notably, in June, the SEC accused the publicly traded digital asset exchange of operating without the necessary licenses as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency.\nState securities regulators emphasized that the court should not allow Coinbase to avoid compliance by narrowly interpreting the law that applies to other participants in the nation’s securities markets.\nThe regulators voiced that the court should ensure equitable treatment for digital assets within the legal framework, stating that the SEC’s case against Coinbase is not “extraordinary.”\nThey cited the Howey Test, which determines whether certain transactions should be categorized as investment contracts and thus fall under securities regulations or not. However, there has been disagreement within the digital asset industry about how the SEC has applied this traditional test to digital assets.\nDespite the controversy, the SEC maintains that particular digital assets that meet the criteria for investment contracts under the Howey Test are firmly grounded in existing legal standards. This viewpoint has recently received support from the NASAA, whose general counsel, Vincente Martinez, stated the regulator’s position is neither “novel nor extraordinary.”\nNASAA further challenged Coinbase’s argument by invoking the “major questions doctrine,” which requires the executive agencies to seek congressional approval when dealing with matters of significant political or economic importance. Martinez commented on the matter by stating:\n“It cannot be the law that an agency needs specific Congressional authorization to apply existing legislation to new fact patterns in complex and changing financial markets.”\nMoreover, Martinez boldly states that digital assets cannot be reasonably deemed a substantial contributor to the American economy. He writes:\n“With very few exceptions, digital assets are not widely accepted to pay for goods or services, nor can they be used to satisfy obligations to the government such as fees or taxes. Coinbase overstates both the size and significance of this ‘industry,’ particularly the portion that securities regulators oversee.”\nNASAA comprises 67 members, including securities regulators from all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, and Mexico. The organization plays a crucial role in investor protection and regulation in North America.\nRelated reading:\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-12T00:20:16-04:00","tag":"Exchanges","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

This substantial growth in revenue underscores its successful turnaround since emerging from bankruptcy.\nMoreover, Core Scientific reported a net income of $210.7 million for the first quarter, a substantial improvement from the net loss of $0.4 million reported in Q1 2023. This rise in net income was primarily attributed to gains from obligations amounting to $143.8 million and a drop in Chapter 11 financing expenses.\nAs per the company’s financial report, revenue from Bitcoin mining reached $150 million, while hosting revenue contributed $29.3 million.\nOf particular note is the Bitcoin mining revenue in excess of mining costs, which stood at $68.4 million, reflecting a remarkable 46% gross margin. This is a significant improvement from the $25.4 million in revenue and 26% gross margin reported in the same period of 2023.\nThe increase in overall revenue from mining can be attributed to higher bitcoin prices and the company’s enhanced mining capacity.\nCore Scientific acknowledged that mining revenue was primarily driven by a 134% increase in BTC price and a 20% increase in the company’s self-mining hash rate.\nHosting revenue in excess of hosting costs also saw a notable increase, reaching $9.3 million with a 32% gross margin, compared to $6.4 million and a 28% gross margin in Q1 2023.\nThe surge in hosting revenue was primarily attributed to the onboarding of new mining clients, which drove a $6.7 million increase in hosting revenue.\nCEO Adam Sullivan expressed confidence in the company’s infrastructure, stating that it is well positioned to meet the growing demand for power and infrastructure required for high-performance computing. He explains:\n“Our infrastructure is well positioned to take advantage of the enormous demand for power and infrastructure required for high-performance computing, and we see this as the next major growth opportunity for our business.”\nFollowing the Bitcoin halving event, which cut miners’ rewards by half, Core Scientific planned strategic mining equipment purchases at lower prices.\nSullivan added: “We are waiting to make countercyclical miner purchases to take advantage of improved pricing. After the recent halving, we are already seeing that dynamic take shape, with post-purchase pricing lower than pre-purchase.”\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2024, Core Scientific reported that it self-mined 2,825 bitcoin, reportedly more than any other publicly listed miner in North America.\nNotably, the company owns around 745 megawatts of infrastructure that generates a total hash rate of 25.5 EH/s, comprising 19.3 EH/s for self-mining and 6.2 EH/s for hosting operations during the quarter.\nIt’s worth mentioning that Core Scientific received court approval to emerge from bankruptcy and relist its shares on the Nasdaq on January 16, marking the end of a successful 13-month restructuring process.\nThe company’s solid performance in Q1 2024 positions it as a leading player in the Bitcoin mining industry.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/10/2024","tag":"Asics","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

The nation’s Bitcoin journey is helping it reshape its financial landscape amid global scrutiny and domestic challenges.\nThe country has made a significant mark by becoming the first country to adopt it as legal tender. This move was spearheaded by President Nayib Bukele and was approved by El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly in June 2021.\nThe Bitcoin Law, which went into effect on September 7, 2021, positions bitcoin alongside the U.S. dollar, which has been the nation’s official currency since 2001.\nThe Salvadoran government advocated for this law as a strategy to boost investment, economic growth, and to decrease the cost of remittances from Salvadorans living abroad, which account for about 20% of the GDP.\nTo support this initiative, El Salvador launched a national digital wallet called Chivo, meaning “cool” in local slang, enabling transactions in both bitcoin and U.S. dollars. The government encouraged the wallet’s use by offering a $30 bitcoin incentive for user registration.\nThe infrastructure to facilitate Bitcoin transactions, including the installation of Bitcoin ATMs, was also put in place. However, the economic impact of adopting Bitcoin has been mixed, with varied acceptance among businesses and investors due to its price fluctuations in dollar terms.\nThe international response was predominantly critical, with entities like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank expressing concerns about potential risks to economic stability and financial integrity.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been particularly outspoken, emphasizing the potential issues like money laundering and financial instability that could arise from bitcoin’s use as legal tender.\nIMF advises against the use of Bitcoin in this capacity due to its volatility and the associated risks to consumer protection. Similarly, the World Bank has declined to assist El Salvador with the implementation of bitcoin as legal tender, pointing out concerns related to environmental impact and transparency.\nDespite these challenges, the Salvadoran government remains invested in Bitcoin-centered projects, including the ambitious plan for a “Bitcoin City” funded by Bitcoin bonds, intended to serve as a center for innovation.\nThis bold move by El Salvador continues to be a significant global experiment in integrating bitcoin into a national economy, with ongoing developments and implications yet to be fully realized.\nCountries like the United States have also shown concern, particularly focusing on the potential for Bitcoin to be misused within the financial system for activities like money laundering and other illegal transactions.\nDespite these international warnings, the Salvadoran government has pressed ahead with its Bitcoin initiatives, which has led to mixed reactions within the country. Some citizens are excited about the innovative potential, while others protest the lack of public consultation.\nGlobally, El Salvador’s move is regarded as a test case for the broader adoption of Bitcoin. This initiative is being closely observed, and its outcomes might influence future international policies and attitudes towards Bitcoin and its use in national economies.\nAs El Salvador continues to navigate these challenges, the global community remains keen on understanding the long-term implications of this groundbreaking economic approach.\nOn March 14, 2024, Nayib Bukele, the current President of El Salvador, announced the contents of the nation’s Bitcoin cold wallet. As of the announcement, the wallet holds 5,749.76 bitcoin, currently valued at approximately $356 million.\nFollowing President Bukele’s disclosure of El Salvador’s Bitcoin address, the account received a flurry of donations from supporters worldwide.\nOn May 13, 2024, President Nayib Bukele unveiled El Salvador’s Bitcoin Treasury Tracker. Hosted at bitcoin.gov.sv, this website functions as a modified version of mempool.space, specifically designed to monitor El Salvador’s bitcoin reserves in real-time.\nIt allows any user to track the country’s bitcoin holdings and transaction activities transparently.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-05-19T09:34:00-04:00","tag":"El Salvador","author":"Luis Lopez"},

This proposed city is to be located near the Conchagua volcano in southeastern El Salvador, leveraging the volcano’s geothermal energy to power the city and its Bitcoin mining operations.\nThe use of renewable energy sources is a central theme, aligning with global trends toward sustainability and addressing the typically high energy demands of Bitcoin mining.\nBitcoin City is envisaged as a center for technological innovation, especially focusing on advancements in Bitcoin usage and blockchain technology.\nBy creating a hub that is both tax-advantageous and technologically forward-looking, El Salvador aims to position itself as a leader in the Bitcoin space, encouraging global tech investment and economic development within its borders.\n#Bitcoin City is coming along beautifully ❤️ pic.twitter.com/A6ay8aAREW\nEl Salvador is capitalizing on its geologically active landscape, which includes over 20 volcanoes, to support its national energy needs, currently deriving about 25% of its energy from geothermal sources.\nThe Bitcoin City project near the Conchagua volcano plans to expand this usage, specifically to power Bitcoin mining operations.\nThis strategic use of geothermal energy not only provides a renewable energy source but also significantly reduces the environmental impact associated with traditional Bitcoin mining methods.\nDeveloping this infrastructure requires substantial investment, particularly in geothermal power plants and grid systems essential for large-scale Bitcoin mining. The process involves complex drilling to access steam at high temperatures, demanding considerable upfront capital.\nHowever, once operational, these geothermal facilities offer a cost-effective and reliable energy source, aligning with El Salvador’s vision for a sustainable and technologically advanced Bitcoin City.\nEl Salvador’s use of geothermal energy presents a stable and cost-effective power source for Bitcoin mining, potentially boosting profitability by lowering energy costs. This reduction in costs can give Bitcoin miners in El Salvador a competitive edge in the global market.\nAdditionally, by promoting itself as a center for sustainable Bitcoin mining, El Salvador aims to attract foreign investment from those interested in environmentally friendly and cost-efficient operations.\nThis strategy is expected to spur economic development and job creation within the region, aligning with the broader goals of the Bitcoin City project.\nEl Salvador’s Bitcoin City is designed as a tax haven to attract businesses and individuals by significantly reducing traditional tax burdens.\nThe city plans to eliminate income, property, and capital gains taxes on Bitcoin transactions, aiming to create an attractive environment for entrepreneurs, investors, and companies.\nInstead, a value-added tax (VAT) will be the sole tax imposed, which will fund city infrastructure and municipal services like sanitation and public lighting.\nThis simplified tax system is expected to reduce administrative costs and attract capital-intensive projects and investors seeking favorable tax conditions. The absence of a capital gains tax on Bitcoin is particularly appealing, likely encouraging more vigorous Bitcoin trading and investment activities.\nBitcoin City’s strategy aims not only to draw wealth but also to foster innovation and economic growth, positioning El Salvador as a leader in integrating digital currency into a sustainable economic model.\nHowever, the city’s ability to promote broad economic benefits beyond just wealth accumulation will be crucial to its long-term success.\nEl Salvador’s Bitcoin City embodies a bold vision to position the country as a leader in the digital future. The city aims to serve as a hub for economic growth, technological innovation, and environmental sustainability, leveraging Bitcoin to drive economic transformation.\nA key component of Bitcoin City’s strategy is its commitment to environmental sustainability, using geothermal energy from the Conchagua volcano to power Bitcoin mining.\nOverall, Bitcoin City is designed to demonstrate how Bitcoin can be integrated into daily life and urban planning, potentially providing substantial economic benefits and positioning El Salvador as a pioneering model in the digital economy.\nEnvironmental concerns also loom large over Bitcoin City. While the use of geothermal energy from the Conchagua volcano is touted as sustainable, the overall environmental footprint of Bitcoin mining, which requires significant computational power, remains substantial.\nCritics point out that the production and disposal of mining hardware contribute to electronic waste and use resources that might be better allocated to other public needs.\nSocial and political criticisms focus on the transparency of the project and its actual benefits to the local population. There is skepticism about whether Bitcoin City will serve the broader interests of Salvadorans or merely enrich a narrow segment of tech investors and tourists.\nThe project was introduced with considerable publicity but little in the way of public consultation, raising concerns about governance and public accountability.\nThe technological focus on Bitcoin to the exclusion of other economic activities could potentially lead to social stratification, creating a divide between those who are part of the Bitcoin economy and those who are not.\nThis could exacerbate existing inequalities and limit the city’s appeal and accessibility to a broader population.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-05-03T12:17:31-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Luis Lopez"},

The first involves a whale identified by the wallet address “33ds4…Q1yCc,” which has moved a substantial amount of 2,400 bitcoin, worth around $157 million, from the Coinbase exchange.\nAt the same time, an unidentified whale, marked by the wallet address “bc1qv…m4jpf,” has transferred 770 bitcoin, worth around $50 million, from Gemini to an unknown wallet.\nThis recent surge in on-chain transactions by whales has sparked discussions within the bitcoin community regarding its potential positive impact on Bitcoin’s short term price trajectory.\nMarket analysts are now speculating on the likelihood of a forthcoming price rally, buoyed by the increased demand from large institutional investors.\nMoreover, after witnessing muted trading for several days, the consecutive four days of cumulative inflows recorded by the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also fueled investor confidence.\nAs of writing, bitcoin is trading around $67,200, marking a 5.3% increase over the past seven days.\nDespite this upward trend in price, the one-day trading volume has slipped by 25%, now standing at $31.15 billion. CoinGlass data also notes a 0.46% rise in Bitcoin Futures Open Interest to $32.23 billion as of May 16.\nRenowned analyst Rekt Capital noted that with the recent upward movement, BTC has turned the old major resistance at $60,000 into a new major support.\nMeanwhile, pseudonymous bitcoin trader Yoddha highlighted the potential for a bullish continuation pattern. In a May 16 X post, they stated:\n“The current range is surely forming a bullish continuation pattern. A breakout will send BTC to a new ATH.”\nThe ongoing accumulation by whales and the steady performance of bitcoin above the $66,000 mark reflect a robust market sentiment.

This development promises to enhance accessibility, security, and affordability in the realm of digital assets.\nStark unveiled this revolutionary initiative at the Crypto and Digital Assets Summit hosted by FT Live in London.\nEmphasizing the significance of this milestone, Stark remarked, “The idea is to have crypto dollars and stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain.” This bold vision represents a paradigm shift in the utilization of Bitcoin, transcending its traditional role as a speculative asset.\nAt the core of this innovation lies the Taproot Assets protocol, meticulously engineered by Lightning Labs. Through relentless efforts, developers have made strides in testing this protocol on the Lightning Network. Stark proudly declared:\n“We released an early part of the code in October and recently demoed the first-ever transaction on Lightning of an asset.”\nStark champions Bitcoin as the optimal platform for hosting stablecoins, citing its unrivaled security and decentralization. Traditionally, stablecoins have operated on alternative blockchains fraught with exorbitant fees and operational inefficiencies.\nStark’s conviction in Bitcoin’s superiority as a host platform underscores a seismic shift in the digital asset landscape.\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a surge in stablecoin adoption, particularly in emerging markets. Stark elucidated:\n“The stickiest users have been those looking for a stable store of value. In some cases, they’re using Bitcoin. In other cases, they’re using stablecoins, and in some cases, it’s a combination of both.”\nThis trend underscores the growing demand for stability amidst economic volatility.\nStark envisions Lightning-powered stablecoins as a catalyst for financial inclusion, offering a lifeline to individuals grappling with hyperinflation and economic instability. By democratizing access to stable store-of-value assets, this initiative has the potential to uplift millions worldwide.\nOne of the most compelling aspects of this development is its cost-effectiveness. Stark highlighted the sharp contrast between traditional financial systems, such as Visa, where fees can soar as high as 3%, and the Lightning Network, where fees for transacting are significantly lower.\nThis affordability factor could democratize global transactions, empowering individuals and businesses alike.\nAs Lightning Labs continues to refine its protocol, the prospect of stablecoins seamlessly integrated into the Bitcoin network beckons a new era of innovation and accessibility in the digital asset sphere.\nStark reaffirmed this sentiment, stating: “That’s why we’re building this protocol, this technology right now. We’re not issuing assets, we’re building the rails. Asset issuers will use our technology to issue real-world tokenized assets.”\nThe integration of stablecoins onto the Bitcoin Network marks a monumental stride towards democratizing access to digital assets. Led by Lightning Labs, this initiative underscores the transformative potential of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network in fostering financial inclusion and empowerment.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/10/2024","tag":"Adoption","author":"Alex Lari"},

This marks the fourth consecutive day of net inflows for bitcoin ETFs.\nAccording to data from Farside Investors, BlackRock’s IBIT attracted the largest inflow of $93.7 million. This surge is particularly notable given that IBIT has seen minimal to no inflows over the past three weeks.\nFidelity’s FBTC fund also saw substantial inflows, bringing in $67.1 million, while Ark Invest’s ARKB reported net inflows of $62 million. Valkyrie’s bitcoin ETF also reported inflows, with $18.5 million moving into the fund.\nMeanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC, which had been experiencing large net outflows since its conversion from a trust structure to an ETF in January, recorded a meagre net inflow of $4.64 million. Other funds from Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and Galaxy Digital also netted smaller, single-digit inflows.\nThese consecutive days of net inflows coincide with Wall Street’s first quarter 13F reporting season, where major financial players disclosed their stakes in spot bitcoin ETFs.\nThe filings revealed that institutional interest in these funds was greater than anticipated. More than 700 different entities have disclosed holdings in bitcoin ETFs, a stark contrast to the usual two to three holders for newly launched ETFs.\nAs of March 31, Morgan Stanley held over $270 million in spot bitcoin ETFs, while Millennium Management disclosed an enormous stake of $1.94 billion across five bitcoin funds.\nThe State of Wisconsin Investment Board also revealed substantial holdings, with $163 million invested in BlackRock and Grayscale’s funds.\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, noted that 414 holders have reported holding BlackRock’s IBIT. He wrote on X that having even 20 holders as a new ETF is significant, making IBIT’s achievement particularly “mind-boggling.”\nThe diverse range of holders of these ETFs includes hedge fund managers, investment advisors, private equity firms, pension funds, brokerages, banks, trusts, insurance companies, holding companies, and family offices.\nBalchunas emphasized the uniqueness of IBIT’s rapid adoption and broad holder base. He stated:\n“Normally you don’t see this long list of holder types until years after launch and with mega liquidity — which IBIT already has.”\nThe diverse range of investors and substantial stakes held by several financial giants reflect the maturation of the bitcoin ETF market, suggesting a promising future for these investment vehicles.\nDespite the consistent inflows, the overall trading volume of bitcoin ETFs remains lower than the record levels observed in March. However, the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have accumulated a total of $12.40 billion in net inflows so far.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/18/2024","tag":"ETF","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

This move marks a milestone in the region’s efforts to establish itself as a global digital asset hub.\nThe Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has granted conditional approvals to several asset managers, including Harvest Global Investments, HashKey Capital, Bosera Asset Management, and China Asset Management, to launch spot Bitcoin ETF. The approvals come after a dedicated regulatory regime was rolled out last year, signaling Hong Kong’s commitment to embracing digital assets. Hong Kong based digital asset platform, OSL, was named the “first virtual asset trading and sub-custodian partner” for China Asset Management’s future ETFs.\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) stated that it grants a conditional authorization letter to an ETF application if it meets their criteria, with conditions like fee payments, document filings, and approval from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX).\nOSL mentioned:\n“In this collaboration, OSL leverages its robust infrastructure to provide a secure trading environment essential for the ETF’s operation, managing the underlying assets with precision and reliability.”\nUnlike its neighboring mainland China, which has implemented a broader crackdown on digital assets trading and mining, Hong Kong has welcomed such firms with open arms. Bosera Asset Management expressed:\n“The introduction of the virtual asset spot ETFs not only provides investors with new asset allocation opportunities but also reinforces Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and a hub for virtual assets.”\nOne notable aspect of Hong Kong’s spot ETFs is the adoption of the in-kind creation model. This model allows new ETF shares to be issued using bitcoin directly, enhancing market liquidity and facilitating uninterrupted trading flows. Patrick Pan, CEO of OSL Digital Securities, highlighted the significance of this mechanism, stating:\n“The in-kind subscription model for the spot BTC and ETH ETFs in Hong Kong represents a substantial innovation, this mechanism enhances market liquidity by allowing the direct exchange of the asset for ETF shares, reducing reliance on cash settlements and facilitating uninterrupted trading flows, this principle is essential for ensuring market stability and is consistent with practices in both digital and traditional asset ETFs.\nHe mentioned that while the exact dates haven’t been finalized yet, everyone involved is working hard to speed up the launch process. Pan anticipate that once these ETFs are introduced, there will be a notable increase in investment flowing into the digital asset market in Hong Kong.\nThe news of Hong Kong’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has had a positive impact on the market as bitcoin price rose by as much as 4.3%. The anticipation of institutional demand during Asia trading hours has also fueled optimism among market participants. QCP Capital, a Singapore-based digital assets trading house, believes that the ETFs, when approved, will unlock institutional demand and provide investors with an Asia-based alternative for exposure to digital assets.\nQCP noted:\n“Participants who wanted exposure have always been limited to US hours, but this now gives institutional investors an Asia-based alternative […] We believe this will be bullish short term, but there are more important narratives and drivers such as macro events.”\nHong Kong’s ambition to become a global digital asset hub is evident in its efforts to attract digital asset firms and investors. With the granting of licenses to platforms like HashKey and OSL, Hong Kong is positioning itself as a leading destination for Bitcoin-related activities. The approval of spot ETFs further solidifies Hong Kong’s reputation as a modern financial hub and demonstrates its commitment to innovation and growth in the digital asset space.\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong marks a significant milestone in the region’s journey towards embracing the digital asset. With conditional approvals granted to leading asset managers, Hong Kong is poised to become Asia’s first major financial center to accept bitcoin as a mainstream investment tool. The move not only reinforces Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub but also underscores its commitment to fostering innovation and growth in the digital asset industry.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-04-16T12:34:00-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Alex Lari"},

An In-Depth Guide | Bitcoin News","content":" BTC/USD:\n$66,938\n24H Change:\n0.11%\nFear & Greed:\n72 (Greed)\nDominance:\n55.2%\nLightning Nodes:\n13,668\nCurrent Fees:\n12 Sats/vb\nLiquidity:\n485.0 BTC\nHashRate:\n- EH/s\nMining Difficulty:\n- T\nOne of the very first hurdles a user new to Bitcoin will encounter is what to do with their coins once purchased. At the heart of engaging with this revolutionary technology is the Bitcoin wallet, a tool that not only stores your digital wealth but also empowers users to manage their bitcoin with autonomy and security when done properly. This guide delves into the intricacies of Bitcoin wallets, ensuring novices and seasoned users alike can navigate this landscape with confidence.\nA Bitcoin wallet is akin to a digital keychain, holding the keys to unlock your bitcoin stored on the blockchain. Each wallet contains a set of private keys, a secret code that allows you to spend your bitcoin, paired with public addresses, identifiers that enable you to receive bitcoin. This fundamental tool interfaces with the Bitcoin network, providing a balance of security and accessibility.\nWallets have come a long way since the inception of Bitcoin, becoming more and more convenient and easy to use, especially for less technically savvy users. Nowadays, most wallets implement the Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) standard. Before we get into some of the more technical aspects, it’s important to understand some of the more basic concepts.\nBefore exploring the intricacies of Bitcoin wallets and their operational flow, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with the following basic concepts:\nUnderstanding these concepts provides a solid foundation for grasping the more complex mechanisms of Bitcoin wallets that we will discuss below.\nThe functionality of Bitcoin wallets is rooted in cryptographic principles, enabling secure management of bitcoin. Here’s an overview of the process from generating a mnemonic phrase to the creation of a public address, as used in the HD wallet standard:\nThe journey begins with the generation of a mnemonic phrase, typically 12 to 24 words long, derived from a predefined list of 2048 words. This phrase, based on random selection, serves as a human-readable form of your wallet’s seed.\nThe mnemonic phrase is processed through a hashing algorithm to produce a 512-bit seed, incorporating optional passphrase protection for added security. This seed is the foundation from which all cryptographic keys are derived.\nFrom the seed, a master private key, and a master chain code are created. The master private key is essential for generating all subsequent private keys, while the master chain code helps in deriving the corresponding public keys.\nThe master public key is calculated from the master private key. It allows the derivation of all subsequent public keys—and therefore public addresses—without exposing the master private key.\nHierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet Structure\nThe master keys facilitate the creation of a hierarchical tree of keys, enabling the organized generation of multiple wallets, accounts, and addresses from the same seed, simplifying fund and address management.\nChild keys, both private and public, are derived from their parent keys, maintaining a deterministic structure that ensures the same parent always produces the same child keys. This structure includes hardened and non-hardened derivations to enhance security.\nPublic keys are transformed through cryptographic functions to generate a public address. This address, encoded for user-friendliness, is what others use to send you bitcoin.\nExtended keys carry additional data, like the chain code and parent key identifier, allowing for the reconstruction of the wallet’s key structure if needed.\nThis intricate process showcases the cryptographic foundation of Bitcoin wallets, ensuring secure and efficient management of bitcoin. Hopefully, you can better appreciate the balance between security, convenience, and control that wallets provide in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nNow, let’s dive into the concept of addresses. It’s important to understand some of the subtleties involved so that you reduce the chances of making mistakes.\nAddresses play a critical role in facilitating the secure transfer of bitcoin. Here’s what you need to know about Bitcoin addresses:\nSome wallets will offer you the option to select which kind of address format you want to use. If it’s your first wallet and you do not intend on doing complex transactions (which will end up costing you more in fees) and want to save on transaction fees, then select the Bech32 (SegWit) format.\nTo enhance security and privacy, it is recommended to use a new address for each transaction. HD wallets facilitate this practice by generating a hierarchical tree of addresses from a single seed, allowing users to maintain privacy and reduce the risk of revealing their total bitcoin balance.\nBefore sending bitcoin, verifying the accuracy of the recipient’s address is essential to prevent loss of funds. Double-checking the address and using QR codes can mitigate errors in address entry.\nSince addresses in an HD wallet are derived from the wallet’s seed phrase, backing up the mnemonic seed phrase ensures that all associated addresses and their funds can be recovered in case of device loss or failure.\nThe wallet types mentioned above can come in two types: custodial and non-custodial. More on this below:\nThese terms refer to the wallets’ connectivity to the internet and, by extension, their vulnerability to online threats.\nSelecting a wallet is a balance of security, ease of use, and specific features needed. Open-source wallets are preferred for their transparency, allowing the community to audit them for security vulnerabilities. To better benefit from what Bitcoin has to offer, a non-custodial wallet is the way to go.\nThe setup process involves downloading software or purchasing a device, generating a new wallet, and securely storing the recovery phrase—a critical step for accessing your bitcoin if the wallet is lost.\nTo receive bitcoin, share your public address. This is typically obtained by selecting the “Receive” option in your wallet. To send bitcoin, use your wallet to input the recipient’s address and the amount, by selecting the “Send” option in your wallet. Regularly monitor your transactions and balance for unauthorized activity. You can learn more about setting up and using your first wallet here.\nPrioritize securing your wallet with a passphrase, and two-factor or biometric authentication if available, and consider a hardware wallet for substantial holdings. Regular backups and meticulous private key management are essential to mitigate loss or theft risks. Remember, anyone with access to your mnemonic phrase, private key, or seed can steal your funds. Here are some important security do’s and don’ts:\nEnhance security by requiring multiple-party authorizations for transactions, adding an extra security layer. This is a more complex setup, so it’s not recommend for most users. If you want additional security without risking getting lost in the setup or losing some key materials for recovering your funds, you can opt for the a passphrase.\nA passphrase in the context of Bitcoin wallets is an optional, additional layer of security used alongside the mnemonic seed phrase. It acts as a custom, user-defined extension to the mnemonic phrase, effectively creating a new and unique set of private keys and addresses when applied. This means that even if someone discovers your mnemonic phrase, they would still need the passphrase to access your funds. The passphrase must be remembered precisely, as its loss can make it impossible to recover the wallet’s contents, just as losing the seed phrase would. Also, keep it stored separately from your backup. You can learn more about passphrases here.\nFrom simple software programs to the development of hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, the journey of Bitcoin wallet technology mirrors the community’s growing focus on security and usability. The advent of hardware wallets introduced a robust solution for offline key storage, while the Lightning Network’s emergence prompted innovations in wallet functionalities to accommodate its operations. Take a look at a brief evolution of Bitcoin wallets and functionalities here.\nEmbarking on the Bitcoin journey begins with selecting the right wallet—one that harmonizes security, convenience, and control, tailored to your specific needs. As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves, so too does the landscape of Bitcoin wallets, with each innovation bringing us closer to a future where managing bitcoin is intuitive and secure.\nA Bitcoin wallet is a digital tool that stores private keys, allowing users to manage and transact their bitcoin securely. It acts as a keychain for accessing and controlling one’s digital wealth.\nBitcoin wallets operate based on cryptographic principles, generating a mnemonic phrase, seed, private and public keys, and hierarchical deterministic structures to manage and secure Bitcoin transactions.\nA mnemonic phrase is a series of words generated by a wallet, serving as a human-readable form of the wallet’s seed. It is crucial for wallet recovery and backup.\nPrivate keys are secret alphanumeric codes proving ownership of bitcoin, while public keys and addresses are derived from them, allowing users to receive bitcoin securely.\nBitcoin addresses are alphanumeric strings representing destinations for bitcoin payments. They are generated from public keys and play a critical role in secure transactions.\nBitcoin addresses include P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32 formats, each with its characteristics. The choice of address type may impact transaction fees and security.\nBitcoin wallets come in various types, including software, hardware, paper, web, and Lightning Network wallets. Each type offers different levels of security, convenience, and functionality.\nCustodial wallets manage operations on behalf of the user, providing convenience but sacrificing autonomy. Non-custodial wallets give users full control over their bitcoin and private keys, aligning with the core philosophy of Bitcoin.\nHot wallets are connected to the internet, offering convenience for daily transactions but with security risks. Cold wallets, not connected to the internet, provide enhanced security for long-term storage but with less convenience.\nChoosing a Bitcoin wallet involves balancing security, ease of use, and specific features. Setting up a wallet includes downloading software or purchasing a device, generating a new wallet, and securely storing the recovery phrase for future access.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-02-15T13:02:39-05:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Tristan Borges Solari"},

Further, the firm has plans to re-list on Nasdaq in the near future.\n“The global settlement removes key hurdles to our anticipated emergence from Chapter 11 in January,” said Adam Sullivan, Core Scientific’s Chief Executive Officer.\nCore Scientific has formally settled its agreement with the “Ad Hoc Noteholders Group, the Unsecured Creditors Committee, the Equity Committee, and B. Riley, the company’s debtor in possession lender.” As per Sullivan, the firm now aims to increase its operations and focus on strengthening its business and balance sheet in 2024.\nSullivan added:\n“With our team highly focused on operational excellence, a post-emergence pathway to de-lever our balance sheet, and a plan for continued growth in 2024 and beyond, we are excited to pursue the opportunities ahead of us in the new year.”\nThe shareholders of the Bitcoin mining firm will receive new shares that will be exchanged at a ratio of 25:1 to provide them with $1.08 per pre-exchange share. Additionally, noteholders are entitled to $1.628 for each $1 of face value for convertible notes maturing in April and $1.201 for each $1 face value for notes with a due date in August.\n“Core Scientific also intends to file a motion requesting that the Court modify certain dates and deadlines with respect to the Plan, including an extension of the deadlines to vote on the Plan or file an objection to the Plan. The Company expects to emerge from Chapter 11 in mid-to-late January 2024,” noted the firm.\nThe collapse of Compute North, another major player in the Bitcoin mining sector, was a notable event that preceded Core Scientific’s bankruptcy filing. Compute North filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2022, citing its inability to meet debt obligations. The company’s reorganization plan was approved in February 2023, involving the sale of 13 assets, including four major ones, to satisfy a secured debt of $250 million.\nToday, a filing related to one of our hosting providers was published. Based on the information available at this time, it is our understanding that this filing will not impact our current mining operations.\nWhile some players struggle, the mining industry continues to attract interest. Notably, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, has expressed intentions to enter the Bitcoin mining industry. Tether plans to construct mining facilities and acquire stakes in other Bitcoin mining companies. In November, Paolo Ardoino, the upcoming CEO of Tether, confirmed plans to invest nearly $500 million in the Bitcoin mining sector.\nAs Core Scientific navigates its way out of bankruptcy, the broader bitcoin mining landscape is evolving, with companies adapting to market dynamics and seeking new avenues for growth. The emergence of Core Scientific from bankruptcy signals resilience and adaptability in an industry that remains both challenging and promising.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-01-22T04:06:30-05:00","tag":"Trials","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

For those without a background in finance, computer science, or networking, it can be a difficult read.\nThis essay seeks to demystify the white paper, presenting its concepts in an accessible and straightforward manner for readers without a technical background.\nImagine you want to send money to your friend online. Normally, you would need to go through a bank or payment service like PayPal to make sure the transaction is secure and your money doesn’t get spent twice (double-spending).\nThese banks or services act as a third party or middleman. They keep track of everyone’s money and make sure transactions are valid before approving them.\nHowever, having to rely on a middleman has some downsides:\nThe goal is to create a new electronic cash system that doesn’t need a third party. Transactions would be secure thanks to cryptography (fancy math codes) rather than having to trust a middleman.\nThis would allow any two people to send money directly to each other over the internet without a bank, fees, or the risk of chargebacks. Sellers would be protected from fraud, and buyers could use escrow services if needed.\nThe key is solving the double-spending problem in a decentralized way, without a central authority. That’s what the rest of the paper describes — a peer-to-peer network and system for achieving this.\nIn this system, money is represented by digital coins. But these coins aren’t physical objects. Instead, each coin is like a digital record or log of ownership.\nImagine there’s a piece of paper that says “This coin belongs to Person A”. When Person A wants to give that coin to Person B, they do the following:\nNow Person B has proof of ownership of that coin, because they hold the paper with Person A’s signature transferring it to them.\nWhen Person B wants to spend that coin with someone else like Person C, they just add their own signed transfer statement to the same paper, saying “I, Person B, transfer this coin to Person C.”\nSo the paper trail or chain of ownership keeps growing with each transfer, with every new owner adding their digitally signed transfer statement.\nThis allows anyone to verify the full chain of ownership by looking at all the signatures on the paper trail for that coin.\nHowever, there’s still one big issue. What if Person B tries to cheat by also giving a copy of that same coin’s paper trail to someone else, like Person D? This is called “double-spending” and it’s currently prevented by banks/third-parties keeping ledgers.\nBut in this new system, there needs to be a way to prevent double-spending without a third-party. That solution is described in the next sections.\nTo prevent the double-spending problem without a third-party, we need a way to prove which transaction for a coin happened first in time.\nImagine there’s a very reliable and trusted source that constantly publishes a record of current events and their exact times, like a newspaper.\nWhen Person A wants to transfer a coin to Person B, they make an announcement to this timestamp source, saying “At 3:25pm on June 1st, I transferred my coin to Person B.”\nThe timestamp source then publishes this announcement in their next event record, proving the transfer was made at that specific time.\nNow if Person A tries to double-spend by transferring that same coin to Person C later at 4:15pm, the timestamp record shows the earlier 3:25pm transfer to Person B happened first.\nSo by checking the widely-published and trusted timestamp record, everyone can see which transfer is the valid one that should be accepted.\nOf course, we can’t rely on a single timestamp source like a newspaper, as that reintroduces a third-party we need to trust.\nThe solution is to use a decentralized network of computers, all maintaining their own timestamp records together, so no single entity is in charge.\nEach computer records a batch of recent transactions in a “block”, stamps it with the current time, and links it to the previous block of transactions in a long “chain” of timestamps.\nSo the full chain of transaction blocks, secured by advanced cryptography, acts as the trusted public record of which transactions happened first, second, third, and so on.\nThis distributed timestamp server system run by the network itself prevents double-spends without needing a third-party authority.\nIn the previous section, we described how the network acts as a decentralized timestamp server by computers adding new blocks of transactions to a chain.\nHowever, there needs to be a way to decide which computer gets to add the next block and update the official transaction record.\nIf anybody could just add blocks anytime they wanted, there would be conflicting records and no way to agree on which chain is the correct one.\nThe solution is to make adding new blocks very difficult and have the computers essentially race or compete to be the first to create the next valid block.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis process of expending massive computing work to find the solutions and add blocks is called “Proof-of-Work.”\nThe key idea is that while any computer can try to create blocks, only one can succeed each time. And there’s no way to cheat, because solving these puzzles really does require that much computational effort.\nSo the longest chain of blocks is the trusted one, because that’s the chain with the most cumulative Proof-of-Work behind it from all the computers on the network.\nAs long as honest computers control more total power than any malicious group, they will create the longest valid chain that the entire network accepts.\nThe network that powers this electronic cash system doesn’t have a central authority or server running it. Instead, it relies on the combined efforts of many computers (nodes) working together in a peer-to-peer fashion.\nHere’s a step-by-step overview of how the decentralized network operates:\nThe amazing part is that the network can keep running in this decentralized manner without any central oversight or point of failure. It’s self-sustaining.\nNodes can join and leave the network whenever they want. As long as there is a majority of nodes behaving honestly, the system works.\nNew transactions and blocks get constantly added to the shared transaction chain through competition and consensus among the nodes.\nSince Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the landscape of mining has evolved significantly. Initially, any participant could mine with general-purpose hardware like CPUs or GPUs.\nHowever, the mining process is now predominantly performed by specialized hardware known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), which are far more efficient at solving Bitcoin’s cryptographic puzzles.\nAdditionally, while many nodes continue to participate in transaction verification, a considerable number of these nodes now primarily focus on verifying and maintaining the blockchain without directly engaging in the mining process.\nFor this decentralized network to work, we need incentives to encourage people to run the nodes that power it. Running a node takes effort, electricity and computing power.\nSo here’s how the system incentivizes participation:\nWhenever a node manages to solve the proof-of-work puzzle and gets to add a new block to the chain, that block has a special first transaction in it.\nThis first transaction doesn’t transfer any existing coins, instead it creates brand new coins and assigns them to the node that created that block.\nIt’s like a reward or payment to the node for the work it did to construct a valid new block.\nThis process of generating new coins to reward nodes for their proof-of-work is how all coins initially get created and introduced into the system.\nIt’s similar to how gold miners expend effort and resources to extract new gold and bring it into circulation.\nOver time, as more and more blocks get added, more and more new coins get created and distributed to the nodes doing the proof-of-work.\nAdditionally, regular transactions can also include small fees payable to the node that includes those transactions in their block. This provides another incentive.\nBy incentivizing with newly created coins and transaction fees, the system motivates a network of nodes to power it through their combined efforts without anyone being in charge.\nThe hope is nodes will have more incentive to play fairly than try to disrupt the system, as that would devalue the coins they earn.\nAs more and more transactions get added to the chain of blocks over time, the total data size will keep growing. This chain has to be stored by all nodes on the network.\nIf nodes had to keep absolutely every transaction record forever, even really old ones, eventually they would run out of disk space on their computers to store the massive chain.\nTo prevent this problem, the system allows nodes to discard or “prune” some of the really old/spent transaction data while still keeping the integrity of the overall chain intact.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis pruning process is like cutting off branches of a tree (the old data) but still keeping intact the trunk and roots (the chain’s history encoded in hashes).\nBy only storing these compact hash codes instead of full transaction data, the size of the chain that nodes need to store is vastly reduced over time without compromising integrity.\nThis reduction in storage requirements enables even older computers to participate as nodes in this optimized blockchain system. Consequently, this fosters greater decentralization, as it allows a broader range of devices to contribute to and maintain the network, enhancing its robustness and resilience.\nNormally, to fully verify if a transaction is valid and really part of the approved chain, you need to be running a full node on the network. A full node means you have to download and store the entire blockchain data.\nHowever, there is a “lightweight” method that allows you to still verify payments without having to store the full chain. This makes it easier for devices like mobile phones or simple wallets to still confirm transactions.\nHere’s how the simplified verification works:\nSo in essence, you rely on verifying that the transaction is found in a block that was approved by the honest majority of nodes as part of the valid chain, rather than checking every transaction yourself.\nThis lightweight method allows secure verification of payments by even simple wallets, as long as the network itself remains secure and properly decentralized among honest nodes.\nIn the system described so far, we’ve treated coins as whole individual units that get transferred from owner to owner.\nHowever, in reality, we often need to combine or split values when making payments and receiving change.\nFor example, if you want to pay $7 but only have $5 and $3 coins, you’d need a way to combine their values. Or if you pay $10 for something that costs $7, you’d want $3 back in change.\nThis section explains how the system handles those kinds of combined transactions:\nThis flexible input/output model gets around the limitation of having to transfer whole coin values at a time.\nIt enables micro-payments down to tiny amounts by letting you combine as many inputs as needed. And it ensures there is no lost value by outputting change.\nThe splitting and combining is all handled seamlessly within transactions in the blockchain.\nWhen you make a transaction through a traditional bank, your personal information like name and account numbers are kept private and only accessible to the bank and parties involved.\nHowever, in Bitcoin’s decentralized system where all transactions are publicly announced across the network, some level of privacy is still needed. We don’t want everyone to see which real-world identities are associated with each transaction.\nHere’s how Bitcoin achieves a reasonable degree of privacy:\nIt’s similar to how a public stock market shows trading data like the time, amount and price of trades, but doesn’t reveal the real identities of the buyers and sellers behind each trade.\nSo while not 100% secure, Bitcoin provides a reasonable level of privacy by dissociating real-world identities from the public blockchain, similar to the pseudonymity of online usernames or nicknames.\nThe goal is to find a balance between privacy and verifiability that is suitable for an open digital currency system.\nThis section does some math to analyze how secure Bitcoin’s system really is against potential attackers trying to disrupt or manipulate the transaction history.\nImagine an attacker (like a hacker or malicious group) is trying to modify the public ledger of transactions for their own benefit, like redirecting payments that were sent to someone else.\nThey will attempt to build their own separate blockchain that rewrites the parts they want to change. This is known as a “fork” from the main accepted chain.\nThe key question is: What are the odds that the attacker’s fork could actually outpace and overtake the legitimate chain maintained by honest nodes on the network?\nThe calculations show that the probability of an attack succeeding drops exponentially as more blocks get added to the legitimate chain over time.\nEssentially, as long as honest nodes control more computational power for mining than the attacker, they will keep extending their chain faster than the attacker’s fork.\nThe more the attacker falls behind, the more impossibly difficult it becomes to catch up due to the intense Proof-of-Work requirements.\nUnless the attacker can somehow get control of the majority of the network’s computing power, their odds of successfully rewriting the established blockchain become infinitely small.\nSo while an attack is theoretically possible, Bitcoin’s system makes it practically infeasible for any single attacker to override the authoritative transaction record, as long as the network retains decentralization.\nThe conclusion and key innovation of Bitcoin is the creation of a decentralized, secure system for digital cash that doesn’t require trust in any central authority.\nBy combining key concepts like a public blockchain, Proof-of-Work mining, and economic incentives, Bitcoin allows anyone in the world to cheaply and fairly participate in a globally neutral currency system.\nNo longer do we need to rely on governments, banks or payment processors to verify, approve or control our digital money transfers and ownership records.\nInstead, through decentralized consensus mechanisms and cryptographic verifiability, Bitcoin puts the power into the hands of its global peer-to-peer network participants.\nFor the first time, we have a way for online payments to be transferred in a truly peer-to-peer fashion, without intermediaries, interventions or unnecessary costs.\nBitcoin unlocks the possibility of a globalized, open, neutral digital cash system that is natively internet-based and belongs to the public commons, just like no single entity can claim ownership over the air we breathe.\nThis is what makes Bitcoin extraordinarily important — it takes us away from centralized controlling authorities and into a new era of decentralized global finance and currency for and by the people.\nBitcoin is a complex journey that reshapes our understanding of money and value.\nThis essay aimed to simplify the Bitcoin White Paper, making Satoshi Nakamoto’s groundbreaking ideas more accessible. Just as air is indispensable and universally used, Bitcoin could become essential for digital transactions, offering a new way to think about and use money.\nHumanity is still at the forefront of Bitcoin’s adoption. By learning about it now, you’re positioning yourself in a movement that’s set to revolutionize finance. Your efforts today could be remembered by future generations as foundational in creating a fairer and more prosperous world.\nKeep diving deep into Bitcoin. Every bit of knowledge not only enlightens but also paves the way for innovative opportunities.\nDecentralized, bottom-up systems like Bitcoin flourish when knowledge and adoption spread far and wide. So never stop learning, your journey through Bitcoin might just be the start of something monumental.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-05-14T12:22:18-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Conor Chepenik"},

This achievement marks a significant milestone in the integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems.\nIn a span of just one month after their approval, nine spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively amassed over $10 billion in assets under management. According to Farside, net inflows to these ETFs on February 9 alone amounted to over $540 million. It’s worth noting that since January 11, these ETFs experienced an influx of $2.7 billion, even accounting for GBTC outflows, which amounts to over $6.3 billion.\nData from BitMEX Research showcases strong investor interest in this emerging asset class. Leading the charge is BlackRock’s IBIT fund, boasting a massive $4.1 billion in bitcoin holdings, closely trailed by Fidelity’s FBTC with over $3.5 billion under management. According to the data, all 9 Bitcoin ETFs now hold an impressive $10.2 billion in AUM.\nThe data also shows that Grayscale outflows have slowed down quite significantly. GBTC recorded daily outflows of about $500 million a day on the early days of the Bitcoin ETF launch, but in the recent days, the daily outflows have been reduced to less than $100 million.\nAmong the notable players in this landscape is ARK 21Shares, whose Bitcoin ETF has also crossed the billion-dollar threshold, now holding more than $1 billion worth of bitcoin in its portfolio. However, amidst this remarkable growth, Grayscale’s GBTC faced significant outflows totaling $6.3 billion over the past month, underscoring shifting investor preferences in the bitcoin market.\n$ARKB has crossed $1B+ USD in bitcoin holdings! This isn't just a number – it's a testament to the growing trust and interest in digital assets. Thank you to our community for being part of this journey, as we continue to redefine financial horizons. 👉Learn more about ARKB:… pic.twitter.com/wWRLyNOGtG\nData from Apollo indicates that the 9 Bitcoin ETFs now hold more than 203,000 bitcoin in their coffers. It also shows that Grayscale’s bitcoin holdings have taken quite a hit. From its high of 619,000 BTC at the ETFs launch, the asset manager now holds 466,000 BTC.\nBloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas expressed optimism about the strength of bitcoin ETFs, noting:\n“I thought the Nine would get a bit weaker as GBTC outflows subsided but they’re getting stronger.”\nMarket analysts anticipate continued growth in Bitcoin ETF flows as trading firms conduct thorough due diligence on these investment vehicles. Bitcoin’s price performance has been resilient, consolidating above key technical support levels, including its 200-day moving average. ARK Invest highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a risk-off asset, replacing gold in investment portfolios, a trend expected to persist in the financial markets.\nBased on a recent assessment conducted by ARK Invest:\n“Bitcoin’s price relative to that of gold has increased twenty-fold in the last 7 years. In January 2024, Bitcoin could buy ~20 troy oz of gold, compared to 1 troy oz in April 2017, we believe this trend should continue as Bitcoin increases its role in financial markets.”\nGiven the broader economic landscape, the asset manager forecasts that as inflation cools and real rates rise, bitcoin should remain antifragile as banks continue to lose deposits.\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETF applications by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) marks a significant milestone in the Bitcoin space. This approval comes more than a decade after the initial application by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2013. Various leading financial institutions, including ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, Valkyrie, BlackRock, and Grayscale, have received the green light to launch their respective Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024.\nThe rapid growth of Bitcoin ETFs to a $10 billion milestone within such a short timeframe underscores the increasing institutional interest and confidence in bitcoin investments. With the integration of digital assets into traditional finance gaining momentum, Bitcoin continues to assert its position as a significant player in the global financial landscape. As market dynamics evolve and regulatory frameworks adapt, the future of Bitcoin ETFs holds promise for both investors and the broader digital asset market.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-02-12T12:51:31-05:00","tag":"ETF","author":"Alex Lari"},

The firm has also allocated $45 million and $44.7 million to ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), respectively.\nThe substantial investments by institutions like Millennium Management reflect the growing integration of bitcoin into mainstream financial portfolios. This institutional backing intensifies the bitcoin community’s long-term confidence in the digital asset.\nEric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, hailed Millennium’s dominance, pointing out its $2 billion investment across ETFs.\nHe pointed out that while investment advisors make up the majority of ETF holders, hedge funds also have a significant presence, showing broad interest across sectors.\nAnother popular ETF analyst James Seyffart echoed Balchunas’ observations and challenged those who claim, “It’s only retail traders buying the bitcoin ETFs.”\nMorningstar Direct data indicates a surge in institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs since January, with collective investments reaching around $29 billion.\nBesides Millennium, heavyweights like Bracebridge Capital and the State of Wisconsin’s investment board have also made significant entries into the Bitcoin ETF space.\nOther asset managers like Pine Ridge and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors have reported substantial holdings through IBIT, FBTC, and BITB.\nConversely, Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings have entered with smaller investments, but still noteworthy, totaling nearly $12 million and $53.2 million, respectively.\nMatt Hougan, Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer, emphasized the trend of institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs. He compared this growing interest to the success of gold ETFs launched in 2004, which attracted over $1 billion in their first five days.\nHougan noted that Bitcoin ETFs have seen a historic success in terms of breadth of ownership, with significant investments from professional investors. He states:\n“By the time all the filings are processed, they will show that as many as 700 institutions own $5 billion or more in the new ETFs.”\nMeanwhile, on May 15, Bitcoin spot ETFs experienced a total net inflow of $303 million. Among them, Grayscale’s GBTC saw a single-day net inflow of $27 million, Fidelity’s FBTC had an inflow of $131 million, and Bitwise’s BITB received $86 million.\nOn the other hand, BlackRock’s IBIT experienced zero flow.\nMillennium’s aggressive strategy of diversifying holdings across multiple ETFs could possibly maximize potential gains and act as a smart risk mitigation tactic. This approach aligns with the firm’s goal of capitalizing on the growing digital asset market in a regulated way.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/16/2024","tag":"Asset Protection","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

Inflation occurs when the general price level of goods and services in an economy increases, reducing the purchasing power of the currency. Currency devaluation occurs when a government reduces the value of its currency relative to other currencies, typically through monetary policies like printing more money. Both of these risks can erode the value of people’s savings and investments, making it challenging to plan for the future. However, bitcoin has emerged as a potential hedge against these risks.\nBitcoin is the first truly decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network without the need for a central authority. Unlike traditional currencies, which are subject to government control and monetary policies from central banks, Bitcoin’s supply is limited and predetermined by its underlying algorithm. This means that the currency cannot be manipulated by governments or central banks, making it a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.\nOne way that bitcoin protects against inflation is by acting as a store of value. Because Bitcoin’s supply is limited, its value is not subject to the same inflationary pressures as traditional currencies. This means that as the general price level of goods and services in an economy increases, the value of bitcoin increases as well. This makes bitcoin an attractive option for people looking to protect their savings against inflation.\nAnother way that bitcoin can protect against currency confiscation is by providing a way to hold assets outside of a government’s control. When a government devalues its currency, it can significantly impact people’s purchasing power: as savings and investments lose value, nation-states are sometimes forced to apply exchange controls against other currencies, and even taking people’s foreign currencies stored in the same country. However, because bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, it is not subject to government control or manipulation people can hold their assets in bitcoin as a way to protect against currency confiscation.\nAssuming that someone invested $1,000 in bitcoin every year on January 1st starting from 2010, here’s how much they would have today (as of March 5th, 2023). Pick the year you first heard about bitcoin and then calculate how much you would have been able to buy with $1,000 and test the theory for yourself.\nSo, if someone had acquired $1,000 in bitcoin every year on January 1st, starting in 2010, and held onto their investment until today (March 5th, 2023), they would have a total of approximately 1,003,496.968 BTC, which, at a bitcoin price of $22,000 would be worth approximately $22,076,933,296. Compare that to someone “saving” that money in currency: $13,000, minus the loss of purchasing power from inflation.\nHowever, it’s important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and very, very challenging to endure without selling all or some coins during these periods. Furthermore this scenario includes the very early years of bitcoin when it was barely heard of and worth virtually zero USD. Additionally, investing in bitcoin carries significant risks if you don’t know how to store your coins and it’s essential to do your own research and understand the potential risks before investing.\nIn conclusion, bitcoin has emerged as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. By offering a decentralized digital currency that is not subject to government control, it provides a way to protect against economic risks that can erode the value of people’s savings.\nStill, it’s important to remember that bitcoin is a new and volatile asset, and it may not be suitable for everyone. As with any investment, it’s essential to do your research and understand the risks before investing in bitcoin.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-01-22T13:29:57-05:00","tag":"Inflation","author":"Bitcoin News"},
{"url":"https://bitcoinnews.com/mining/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-drops/","web_url":"https://bitcoinnews.com/","type":"article","description":"Bitcoin difficulty dropped significantly, stirring discussions among miners, investors, and analysts about its market impact.","title":"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Drops 5.6%: Largest Drawdown Since 2022","content":" BTC/USD:\n$66,982\n24H Change:\n0.33%\nFear & Greed:\n72 (Greed)\nDominance:\n-%\nLightning Nodes:\n13,668\nCurrent Fees:\n8 Sats/vb\nLiquidity:\n485.0 BTC\nHashRate:\n- EH/s\nMining Difficulty:\n- T\nBitcoin has recently witnessed a notable decrease in mining difficulty, marking the largest downward adjustment since 2022. This development has sparked discussions among miners, investors, and analysts about its implications for the market.\nBitcoin difficulty refers to the level of complexity involved in finding a specific nonce to validate transactions and create new blocks on the blockchain.\nIt is a crucial metric that adjusts approximately every two weeks to ensure a consistent block discovery time of around 10 minutes, regardless of changes in miner activity.\nIn its most recent adjustment, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty experienced a significant decline, dropping -5.6%. This adjustment is primarily attributed to fluctuations in the network’s hash rate, which measures the computational power dedicated to mining.\nThe reduction in mining difficulty reflects broader shifts within the Bitcoin mining landscape.\nThe data also shows a notable decline in hash rate, which in turn led to the decrease in difficulty. According to data from BitInfoCharts, the network’s hash rate dropped from its all-time high of 650 Eh/s in mid-April to 570 Eh/s.\nThis information suggests that the miners who found the new block rewards unprofitable, might have switched off their machines. Therefore, factors such as the recent halving event, fluctuations in bitcoin’s price, and changes in miner behavior could have contributed to this adjustment.\nThe decrease in mining difficulty is expected to provide some relief for miners who have been grappling with declining revenues since the halving event. With lower difficulty levels, miners can mine blocks more efficiently, potentially improving their profitability.\nAfter the halving, Bitcoin’s difficulty rose, partially due to the introduction of the Runes protocol by Casey Rodarmor. Runes improved token creation on Bitcoin, briefly boosting miner revenues through transaction fees.\nHowever, the fees soon normalized, falling from $128.45 to approximately $1, as per Mempool records.\nNick Hansen, CEO of Luxor mining pool, explains:\n“If there isn’t enough margin for miners to make a profit, they turn off, which causes the hash rate to go down.”\nThis sentiment is echoed by Scott Norris, CEO of Optiminer, who believes that the adjustment is a normal occurrence after a halving event and is healthy for the network.\nFor investors, the drop in mining difficulty could have broader implications for the market. Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, notes that miners are currently underpaid by the most since March 2020, indicating significant challenges in the sector.\nHe noted:\n“As revenue has declined sharply after the halving, Miners are currently underpaid by the most since March 2020, the COVID crash.”\nHowever, some analysts remain optimistic about the sector’s future growth. Norris suggests that miners who planned properly will adapt by upgrading their technology and finding cheaper energy sources. This adaptability could ultimately strengthen the network and attract more investors.\nHe added: “Either way, the network will continue to grow. It always happens this way. Historically, it’ll be late in the year before we see much price rise [for Bitcoin].”\nBitcoin’s price movements have also played a significant role in shaping mining difficulty.\nThe asset’s price has experienced volatility, reaching new highs before retracing to lower levels. This volatility, coupled with the halving event, has contributed to changes in miner behavior and network dynamics.\nDespite the challenges posed by declining revenues and increased competition, miners continue to operate in the hope of future price appreciation.\nNishant Sharma, founder and CEO at BlocksBridge Consulting, a firm specializing in research and communication strategies within the Bitcoin mining sector, highlighted that this pattern is typical following a halving event, stating:\n“After a Bitcoin halving, the drop in mining rewards leads less efficient miners to unplug their machines […] This self-adjusting feature favors leaner operations, as remaining miners receive increased rewards due to the reduced difficulty.”\nAdditionally, there has been limited trading in spot Bitcoin ETFs. Farside Investor’s data shows minimal net movement, with Bitwise Bitcoin ETF being the sole issuer to see inflows on May 8.\nDespite recent hurdles, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, notes no miner capitulation. He posits that miners’ post-halving profits may endure if bitcoin hits $80,000.\nAs Bitcoin continues to evolve, the dynamics of mining difficulty are likely to remain a focal point for miners, investors, and analysts alike.\nThe ability of miners to adapt to changing market conditions, coupled with investor sentiment and regulatory developments, will shape the future trajectory of the bitcoin market.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/11/2024","tag":"Analysis","author":"Alex Lari"},

In response, a spokesperson for Stanford has reportedly acknowledged the donations and committed to returning the funds to the debtors.\nStanford received $5.5 million in donations from the now-bankrupt exchange FTX, purportedly channeled to the university by Joe Bankman, who is not only SBF’s father but also a long-standing faculty member at the university. In reported statement, Stanford spokesperson wrote:\n“Stanford received gifts from the FTX Foundation and FTX-related companies largely for pandemic-related prevention and research. We have been in discussions with attorneys for the FTX debtors to recover these gifts and we will be returning the funds in their entirety.”\nAccording to the spokesperson, most of the “gifts” received from FTX or FTX-affiliated entities were designated for “pandemic-related prevention and research.”\nThis development follows a lawsuit filed by the FTX estate against its former CEO, SBF’s parents Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, who are both legal scholars and professors at Stanford University. Notably, they are accused of using their influence to financially “enrich themselves, directly and indirectly, by millions of dollars.”\nJoe Bankman, a tax lawyer, held the role of senior advisor at the FTX Foundation, entailing a base salary of $200,000 along with a possible “discretionary bonus,” as outlined in Tuesday’s lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit contends that Bankman “led the charge” in “fraudulently transferring and misappropriating” $5.5 million in funds directed to Stanford, between November 2021 and May 2022.

The debtors alleges:\n“Bankman’s repeated efforts to direct funds from the FTX Group to Stanford University constitutes a flagrant breach of those duties, as they effectively enriched Bankman’s employer (Stanford University) at the expense of the FTX Group.”\nRepresentatives for SBF’s parents have called the lawsuit’s allegations “entirely untrue” and “a dangerous attempt to intimidate Joe and Barbara and undermine the jury process just days before their child’s trial begins.”\nFTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 amid financial concerns, causing a significant loss of customer funds. SBF, awaiting his trial in October, is accused of defrauding investors and mishandling billions in customer funds, which prosecutors have called one of the biggest financial frauds in US history.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-31T21:19:43-04:00","tag":"Exchanges","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

Notably, this surpasses the holdings of major entities such as MicroStrategy, Tether, and all public bitcoin miners combined.\nBlackRock’s IBIT spot bitcoin ETF takes the lead, managing over 128,000 BTC ($7 billion) out of the total 300,000 BTC. Fidelity’s FBTC follows closely by accumulating more than 94,000 BTC ($5 billion).\nMeanwhile, the assets held by Grayscale’s converted GBTC fund have experienced a decline of over 28%, dropping from approximately 619,000 BTC ($35 billion) to 444,000 BTC ($25 billion) since the launch of the new ETFs on January 11.\nMeanwhile, the collective net inflows into all U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have surpassed an impressive $6 billion mark, with a substantial spike of nearly $520 million recorded on February 26 alone. According to BitMEX Research, this is the highest single-day net inflow in a two-week period.\nFidelity’s FBTC dominated Monday’s inflows, attracting $243.3 million, with Ark Invest 21 Shares’ ARKB securing the second position with $130.6 million worth of inflows.\nMoreover, Grayscale’s higher-fee converted GBTC product witnessed an interesting shift, experiencing its lowest outflows since its conversion, with only $22.4 million leaving the fund. This is a significant reduction from prior trading days and a fraction of the total $7.5 billion in outflows it has experienced so far.\nThe ETFs also marked their highest trading volume day on Monday, reaching $2.4 billion, surpassing the previous record of $2.2 billion set on the inaugural trading day. Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas stated:\n“It’s official..the New Nine Bitcoin ETFs have broken all time volume records today with $2.4b, just barely beating Day One but about double their recent daily average.”\nIt's official..the New Nine Bitcoin ETFs have broken all time volume record today with $2.4b, just barely beating Day One but about double their recent daily average. $IBIT went wild accounting for $1.3b of it, breaking its record by about 30%. pic.twitter.com/MiCs1rzttM\nLeading the volume charts, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust recorded $1.29 billion, closely followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund at $576 million.\nThe sustained net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with the diminishing outflows from GBTC, indicate a robust market demand. This surge in demand, against a backdrop of a diminishing bitcoin supply—especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving in less than two months—has contributed to a bullish scenario for BTC prices.\nWhile miners add a total of 900 new BTC to the daily supply, spot Bitcoin ETFs are witnessing net inflows of nearly 8,000–9,000 BTC on each trading day, further depleting the available supply.\nAs a result, Bitcoin reached a new yearly high of over $57,000 on February 27. Interestingly, the digital asset now stands only 20% below its all-time high of nearly $69,000. Bitcoin’s market capitalization has also breached the $1.1 trillion mark, highlighting the growing interest and confidence in the digital asset.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-02-28T12:58:51-05:00","tag":"ETF","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

Japanese investment firm Nomura’s analysts expects a further 0.5% decline in July compared to the same period of 2022.\nIn addition to that, the Chinese central bank balance sheet decreased to 406420.84 CNY HML in May from 412654.20 CNY HML in April of 2023, after creating no money at all in 2020 and just a tiny amount in 2021.\nAccording to Barclays’s economists, “the challenging deflationary environment and a sharp slowdown in growth momentum support our view that the PBOC has entered a rate-cutting cycle.”\nThe People’s Bank of China already cut policy rates to increase liquidity last month and promised measures to boost household consumption.\nAs the price of bitcoin has historically proven to be very sensitive to monetary liquidity shocks, any shift towards more expansionary economic policies by the second largest economy in the world could have positive effects on it.\nBitcoin price is +82.71% YTD at the moment of writing, and with the recent ETF applications by some of the largest asset managers in the world, such as Blackrock, Fidelity, and WisdomTree, analysts think we have entered the early stage of the next bull run.\nInternational financial company Standard Chartered Bank forecasts bitcoin price to reach $50,000 by the end of this year and $120,000 by the end of 2024 amid the next halving’s impact.\nThanks to the expansive monetary policies and new favorable regulations settled by Hong Kong authorities which allow retail trading in the Chinese territory since second quarter of 2023, Chinese financial markets could play a crucial role in the fulfilling of this prevision.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-07-13T02:14:42-04:00","tag":"Economics","author":"Daniel Ofosu Jr"},

With a record-setting individual daily inflow of $386 million on January 12, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has now surpassed a significant milestone, accumulating a total net inflow exceeding $2 billion.\nAccording to data from BitMEX Research, on January 25, IBIT achieved an impressive daily inflow of $170.7 million, propelling its market cap beyond the $2 billion mark. The following day, it continued its remarkable performance with an additional $87 million in inflows.\nThis has solidified its position as the best-performing fund among the newly approved Bitcoin spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart attributes this success to the recent surge in BTC’s price, stating:\n“Yes, the bitcoin price has pushed IBIT’s assets beyond $2 billion. This plus likely new flows today should mean it will be above $2 billion at close.”\nOn the other hand, Grayscale’s GBTC spot Bitcoin ETF has encountered a substantial decrease in outflows, shedding approximately 6,000 BTC, worth about $255 million day 11. Notably, this has resulted in an overall positive inflow of $14.8 million into Bitcoin ETFs.\nBitcoin Spot ETF Flow – Day 11 GBTC Outflow -$255.1m\nThe positive outlook is reflected in recent bitcoin prices, with the leading digital asset rebounding by 5% to reach the $42,000 mark on Saturday. Despite this recovery, bitcoin remains 14% below its post-ETF approval highs, highlighting the ongoing volatility in the market.\nWhile IBIT leads the pack, Fidelity’s FBTC is not far behind, recording $100 million in inflows on January 26 and bringing its total flows to $1.935 billion.\nOther notable performers in the Bitcoin spot ETF market include Bitwise’s BITB and Ark Invest’s ARKB, both boasting individual cumulative AUMs of over half a billion dollars.\nAs the landscape of Bitcoin ETFs continues to evolve, these developments underscore the dynamic nature of the market, with both established and emerging players vying for dominance.\nAs competition intensifies among providers of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the related advertisements are set to reach every household. Under its revised policy, Google will display Bitcoin ETF ads starting January 29, 2024. In its effort to ensure compliance with local regulations, the tech giant emphasizes that advertisers targeting specific regions must adhere to the respective local guidelines.\nInitially, the advertisements will debut exclusively in the United States, but their prevalence is expected to expand beyond national borders.\nThe expansive reach of Google is expected to magnify bitcoin adoption, reaching a wide global audience. When factoring in Google websites and Play Store apps, the potential audience size can extend into several billions.\nBlackRock’s IBIT’s surpassing of the $2 billion inflow mark, coupled with Fidelity’s strong presence, showcases the massive competition among ETF issuers. As this competition intensifies, Google’s entry into Bitcoin ETF-related advertisements is poised to further amplify the visibility of these investment vehicles.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-01-28T13:12:04-05:00","tag":"ETF","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo believes that bitcoin has significant potential for further upside price growth, highlighting key indicators that suggest a bullish trend.\nOne of the primary tools Woo uses to predict bitcoin’s future is the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Oscillator. Woo’s insights, along with various market data, point to a promising future for the digital asset.\nThis technical indicator provides a nuanced view of price movements by considering the volume of transactions at each price level. Essentially, it gives more importance to prices with higher trading volumes, offering a balanced perspective on market trends.\nIn a series of posts on social media platform X, Woo explained the significance of the VWAP Oscillator. He highlighted that it tracks the ratio between bitcoin’s current price and its VWAP, oscillating around a zero point.\nWhen the Oscillator is in negative territory but starts moving upward, it often signals the beginning of a bullish phase for bitcoin.\nRecent trends show the VWAP Oscillator has been negative for months but is now rising. If this continues, it may soon hit neutral, indicating a potential market shift.\nThis pattern suggests that bitcoin might experience further gains until the Oscillator peaks in positive territory and then starts to decline. Woo summarized this by stating:\n“Still a lot of room to run before reversal or consolidation. Hate to be a trapped Bitcoin bear right now.”\nAnother factor contributing to bitcoin’s positive outlook is the surge in retail investment.\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, retail investors have purchased approximately $135.7 million worth of bitcoin over the past month. This influx of capital from individual investors is a strong indicator of growing confidence in the bitcoin market.\nTechnical analysis of bitcoin’s price charts also supports the bullish outlook. On the 4-hour timeframe, bitcoin has formed promising patterns such as the “bullish abandoned baby” and “bullish engulfing candlestick” patterns.\nThese technical indicators typically signal a continuation of upward momentum.\nOther than these, analyst Crypto Jebb highlighted another bullish pattern known as the inverse head and shoulders.\nThis pattern, combined with other indicators like the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), points to a strong potential for bitcoin’s price to reach new highs. Jebb stated that this pattern could propel bitcoin’s price to $100,000.\nAnother analyst noted that bitcoin’s current price movement closely resembles its 2020 post-halving trend, suggesting a potential takeoff if the pattern continues.\nFurthermore, Woo mentioned that bitcoin is still in the early stages of its liquidity cycle and is undergoing a “very healthy reset” against a backdrop of increasing capital flows. This indicates that bitcoin is building a solid foundation for its next leg up.\nHe added: “Bitcoin SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) update. Profit taking has completed, it took 2 months.”\nThe recent release of lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data has also contributed to bitcoin’s current bullishness. Lower inflation figures tend to boost investor confidence, leading to increased demand for assets like bitcoin.\nOverall, the combination of expert analysis, technical indicators, and active market participation paints a promising picture for bitcoin’s future. As Woo pointed out:\n“Bitcoin is in its liquidity cycle […] it’s still doing warm up exercises […] It’s consolidating under all time highs, during this time long time frame risk signal is quite low. Risk only starts climbing after the floodgates open.”\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/19/2024","tag":"Analysis","author":"Alex Lari"},

Trading for the ETF is scheduled to commence on Tuesday.\nThe approval of the registered futures ETF is a direct outcome of ongoing progress in the industry. Notably, BlackRock has initiated steps towards introducing bitcoin spot ETFs. In the meantime, the Volatility Shares futures ETF has received the necessary approval and is poised to become operational in the upcoming week.\nIn recent weeks, the digital asset industry in the United States has been filled with uncertainties. The SEC has taken a strong stance by cracking down on two major exchanges, Coinbase and Binance. However, there are now positive developments as the SEC has given the green light for a new bitcoin ETF offering in the country.\nThis approval marks a significant milestone as Volatility Shares prepares to launch the first leveraged bitcoin ETF in the United States.\nAs per the prospectus filing, the commencement of operations for the 2x bitcoin Futures ETF is scheduled for June 26, 2023. Furthermore, the filing mentioned that the ETF may exhibit correlation with the CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index.\nVolatility Shares intends to introduce the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (with ticker symbol BITX), designed to provide twice the performance of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index on a daily basis. The company’s website suggests a potential launch date of Tuesday.\nThis decision comes at a time when bitcoin has experienced a recent surge in price. Breaking the $30,000 threshold, this upward movement may have been influenced by the announcement of BlackRock’s spot ETF intentions.\nIn the current market, Volatility Shares stands out as the sole ETF provider in the United States to offer double the returns of bitcoin. With $160 million in assets under management across three funds, Volatility Shares plans to launch the BITX ETF with an expense ratio of 1.85%, as per Bloomberg data.\nThe ETF’s strategy involves not holding bitcoin directly but seeking gains from daily price increases in bitcoin futures contracts, as outlined in the filing.\nHowever, despite the approval of a futures ETF, there remains uncertainty regarding the regulator’s stance on approving bitcoin spot trading offerings.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-06-25T09:06:29-04:00","tag":"Markets","author":"Alex Lari"},

This collaboration is expected to provide Coinbase’s expansive user base, which currently stands at a staggering 108 million users, with access to faster and more cost-effective Bitcoin transactions.\nInterestingly, the move comes at a crucial time, especially as Bitcoin’s base layer fees have been on the rise, necessitating solutions to alleviate transaction congestion and costs. Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, indicated in a recent post on X that the integration of the Bitcoin layer-2 network, known as Lightning, is happening “soon.”\nHas been great working with @lightspark on our Lightning integration which should be launching soon 🙏 https://t.co/KP2CRWZBRw\nNotably, in an official press release posted on April 3, Shan Aggarwal, VP of Corporate & Business Development at Coinbase, noted the exchange’s commitment to making the global financial system “faster and more efficient.” He states:\n“We’re excited to partner with Lightspark to eliminate payment barriers and enable faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions through support for the Bitcoin Lightning Network.”\nIn August 2023, the exchange indicated its exploration of Lightning support, with Armstrong subsequently announcing the decision on integration in September. Concurrently, its competitor Binance already adopted Lightning Network in July 2023, as reported by BitcoinNews.\nHighlighting the significance of the partnership, Lightspark’s official statement underscored the shared commitment to enhancing financial accessibility and efficiency.\nLightspark CEO and co-founder, David Marcus, shared the announcement on X, emphasizing the significance of integrating Lightning across all Coinbase touchpoints. This strategic shift is poised to mitigate the challenges posed by escalating fees on Bitcoin’s main chain.\nThrilled to announce that @Coinbase has selected @Lightspark to enable the #Bitcoin Lightning Network across its platform and services. Yet another significant milestone for Lightning! ⚡to many millions of new people and 100+ countries coming soon! https://t.co/Dj5JDqdmOl\nMarcus states:\n“Bitcoin was the very first asset listed on Coinbase more than a decade ago. With Lightning, Bitcoin transactions will soon be real-time and low-cost, a much-needed upgrade given the recent surge in interest in Bitcoin.”\nLightspark, founded in 2022, has been dedicated to simplifying the complexities associated with implementing and managing Lightning nodes, ensuring reliable transaction processing. The company’s efforts culminated in the development of Lightspark Predict, an AI-driven engine designed to optimize liquidity and routing in real-time. The product aims to enhance transaction success rates and finality times.\nThe collaboration between Coinbase and Lightspark marks a significant milestone for the Lightning Network, amplifying its utility amid the surging demand for Bitcoin transactions. As both entities continue to explore additional payment use cases, the partnership holds the potential to catalyze further innovation within the digital asset landscape.\nAccording to data from Bitcoin financial services firm River, Lightning payments boast an impressive success rate of approximately 99.7%, based on over 300,000 Lightning transactions recorded in October 2023.\n“Nobody is using Lightning” should now be a dead meme. Launching a new #Bitcoin report from @River: How the Lightning Network grew by 1212% in 2 years ⚡ It’s time to pay attention to the incredible work of so many people in the space 👇 Link below in the 🧵 pic.twitter.com/FuGLwGHR4R\nDespite this remarkable success rate, challenges persist, primarily revolving around the availability of liquidity to facilitate seamless transfers. The announcement addresses this challenges:\n“Lightspark integrations will pave the way for additional payment use cases in the near future by allowing more liquidity to be converted in and out of Bitcoin from fiat and cryptocurrencies. We’re excited to be well-positioned to contribute to this transition.”\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-04-05T12:40:28-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

The company faced allegations of offering unauthorized brokerage services and providing unregistered securities to its customers.\nMy statement on the SEC suing Coinbase, inc. https://t.co/5KNEM0IPSV pic.twitter.com/EgRIxrIcjj\nLummis argues that this move could potentially drive the bitcoin industry and its innovative ventures to relocate overseas. Additionally, she highlights the SEC’s failure to establish a clear framework for digital asset companies like Coinbase to legalize and regulate their operations.\nIn her response to this particular legal action, Lummis strongly criticizes the SEC, highlighting multiple areas in which she believes the commission has neglected to support the digital assets industry.\nLummis says she believes that the SEC’s inability to establish a clear registration process for digital asset exchanges and their lack of comprehensive legal guidance to differentiate between securities and commodities is deeply concerning.\nShe adds that by relying on enforcement-based regulation, the SEC is ultimately causing harm to consumers. To truly protect consumers, a strong legal framework must be developed that allows exchanges to operate in compliance, rather than driving the industry overseas or underground.\nIts worth noting that although Gary Gensler, the chair of SEC, has repeatedly expressed that he believes bitcoin is a commodity and not a security, during a hearing held by the House Financial Services Committee in April, he declined to provide any clear answer when questioned about whether Ethereum should be classified as a commodity or security.\nSenator Lummis also states that this is precisely why it is imperative for Congress to pass the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act.\nThe Responsible Financial Innovation Act, introduced by Senators Lummis and Gillibrand in June 2022, looks to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets that promotes responsible financial innovation, transparency, flexibility, and robust consumer protections while integrating digital assets into existing laws.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-06-12T12:51:31-04:00","tag":"Regulation","author":"Alex Lari"},

Without any presale, anyone was free to acquire bitcoin by running a node and mining.\nInitially trading for almost nothing, Bitcoin’s distribution has remained remarkably fair, upheld through a system where anyone can mine or purchase bitcoin.\nAlthough Bitcoin might not be for everyone, it is available to anyone who chooses to participate, ensuring that its acquisition is not confined to a privileged few but open to all through mining and grassroots adoption.\nIn stark contrast, Ethereum’s ether tokens were issued through a highly centralized “presale” in 2014. A cozy group of insiders scooped up 60 million of the initial 72 million ethers at prices around $0.31 each — a blatant premine that handed ether’s control to a select few before public distribution.\nA decade later, Bitcoin exhibits by far the most decentralized and secure network among all digital currencies created. Although some early adopters do hold large amounts of bitcoin, they rightfully earned their holdings by helping bootstrap the network during its crucial initial stages when it needed support.\nBitcoin carries far less risk today than it did in the beginning. Contrary to often cited figures, substantial analyses of addresses suggest that even if wealth concentration exists, it remains less pronounced than in many traditional asset classes.\nThe 80–20 rule is ubiquitous, so it should come as no surprise to observe it in Bitcoin as well. No central party can inflate Bitcoin or abuse its monetary policy. This broad distribution underpins Bitcoin’s role as a sound money system.\nWhile Bitcoin exemplifies a truly decentralized protocol with no central issuers, Ethereum more closely resembles a security according to established legal frameworks like the Howey test.\nThe Ethereum Foundation, a recognizable entity, facilitated the release of ether tokens through a crowdsourced investment sale, where participants had a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of the Foundation’s developers.\nAlthough ether possesses functionalities beyond traditional securities and the SEC’s enforcement approach has faced criticism, these factors do not negate ether’s apparent satisfaction of the Howey test criteria.\nConsequently, ether struggles to attain Bitcoin’s status as a fair, neutral protocol for transferring value over the internet without centralized control or profit-sharing arrangements characteristic of investment contracts.\nBitcoin had no such centralized, security-like release. Its neutral, unbiased entry into the world without corporate allegiances allowed it to organically grow into a worldwide, non-sovereign money controlled by no single group or nation.\nSatoshi walking away from the project only strengthens this neutrality.\nFurthermore, Ethereum’s shift to a proof-of-stake model fatally compromises its ability to serve as sound money free from intermediaries. Its consensus process will require constant validation and permissioning by a those who can hold the most tokens.\nWorryingly, PoS opens the door for nation-states and central banks to potentially “print” unbacked fiat currency and use it to accumulate ether holdings, ultimately co-opting the network by becoming the very stakers responsible for validating transactions.\nIn this scenario, ether risks devolving into merely a rebranded form of fiat under control of monetary authorities, permanently stripping it of any attributes of sovereign, decentralized sound money.\nBitcoin’s unchanging proof-of-work code and lack of centralized authorities make such co-option impossible.\nBut Ethereum’s proof-of-stake architecture provides nation-states a Trojan horse to inevitably infiltrate and dominate the network from within if they so choose.\nRather than blazing a new path for neutral monetary freedom as intended, PoS Ethereum simply reconstructs many of the same centralized choke points and subversion risks that have plagued fiat money for centuries.\nOnly Bitcoin, with its fair proof-of-work launch, inelastic supply controlled by no central party, and commitment to resisting institutional entanglements at all costs, can credibly claim to be in a class of its own as the world’s first truly sovereign money.\nAs nation-states and corporations inevitably attempt to co-opt blockchain technology for their own permissioned and controllable “money 2.0” systems, Bitcoin will remain the only neutral, decentralized, and ethically-launched reserve currency for a free people.\nFor sound money built on principles of fairness, decentralization and immutability, there is no substitute for Bitcoin.\nAll other “cryptocurrencies”, Ethereum included, are mere fiat replicas destined for centralization and control. In the battle for financial freedom, Bitcoin stands alone as the revolution.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-05-13T12:28:35-04:00","tag":"Economics","author":"Conor Chepenik"},

As the first person mining Bitcoin, how much was actually mined has always been a topic of interest.\nA previous study by Sergio Demian Lerner in 2013 estimated that Satoshi mined around BTC 1 million and is the number commonly referenced for the size of Satoshi’s Bitcoin stash. Lerner graphed the ExtraNonce parameter versus block height, which revealed that a single miner, probably Satoshi, mined this amount in 2009.\nExtraNonce is a parameter listed in a Coinbase transaction, where a Coinbase transaction is the block reward generated by successfully mining a block. As a user keeps their computer running, the ExtraNonce value increases in value every time it overflows, which makes it like a clock showing how long a Bitcoin miner has been online. When the mining application is restarted the ExtraNonce is reset.\nThe chart of ExtraNonce versus block height shows that the same miner who mined block #1, which would be Satoshi Nakamoto, was mining throughout 2009 and restarting his wallet about every 100 hours, probably to backup the wallet. The Bitcoins mined by this miner have never been spent and the hashrate throughout 2009 was constant near 7 MH/s, further evidence that this was Satoshi.\nBitMEX Research took Sergio’s analysis a step further and counted all the blocks mined by this dominant miner. This was difficult because ExtraNonce versus block height slopes from other miners crossed through the slopes of the dominant miner. BitMEX Research found that prior to August 2009, Lerner’s analysis was correct but after that, the slopes of the ExtraNonce versus block height lines changed drastically and didn’t have a set rhythm.\nPrior to August 2009, the dominant miner generated 740,750 Bitcoins according to BitMEX Research. After August, the same mined 227,650 Bitcoins but there isn’t certainty in this estimate. The total is 968,400 Bitcoins, about the same as Sergio’s estimate.\nHowever, BitMEX research says that is an overestimate since other miners could have been using a similar setup to Satoshi and the method for counting the blocks mined is prone to overestimates. It says the best estimate is BTC 600,000-700,000.\n\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter: @bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com: https://t.me/bconews\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-03T20:51:43-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Zachary"},

The SEC lawyer stated that the regulatory body does not control all digital assets on Coinbase, emphasizing that Bitcoin is the sole non-securitized asset among the tokens listed on the platform.\nThe SEC lawyer evaded a direct answer on the effectiveness of bitcoin as a currency and emphasized that bitcoin differs from other digital assets because it lacks an ecosystem, stating:\n“Bitcoin is different from other cryptos. What makes Bitcoin different is that it does not have an ecosystem, whereas this is different from other tokens. Because when you buy a different token, you buy their entire ecosystem and the entire incentive.”\nDuring the court hearing, Coinbase fiercely contested the SEC case against it, asserting that the digital assets traded on its platform do not fall under the category of securities. This courtroom battle is a significant development that could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets, ultimately determining the SEC’s jurisdiction over the sector.\nRelated reading: SEC’s Battle on “Unregistered Securities”: What is the Regulator Up To?\nAs the case unfolded, Judge Katherine Polk Failla raised a critical question, drawing attention to Senator Lummis‘s suggestion to dismiss the case. The judge noted Lummis’s substantial involvement in the digital asset space. She asked:\n“She is not just a random senator; She is someone who is deeply involved in this space. Why is she wrong?”\nThe SEC lawyer, however, dismissed the senator’s input, asserting that one senator’s opinion should not override a 90-year-old securities law.\nHowever, Judge Failla did not seem convinced, referencing the Howey Test and suggesting that the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 might be outdated in the context of rapidly evolving technologies like digital assets. She remarked:\n“We’ve had a good run. We’ve had 90 years where these securities laws have been able to apply to these markets. But now we have something new.”\nThe SEC initiated the lawsuit against the exchange in June 2023, alleging that the platform facilitated the trading of at least 13 digital asset tokens that should have been registered as securities.\nThe SEC alleged that Coinbase was operating illegally as a national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency without proper registration. Notably, the regulatory body scrutinized Coinbase’s “staking” program, asserting that it should have been registered with the agency.\nCoinbase sought dismissal of the lawsuit in August, citing a favorable ruling in the Ripple Labs case, where a judge concluded that the sale of XRP did not violate federal securities law.\nHowever, the SEC countered the exchange’s argument, citing a prior ruling in the Terraform Labs case that upheld the regulator’s stance.\nThis legal confrontation underscores the broader clash between digital asset companies and the regulatory body over the classification of tokens as securities, with the outcome likely to shape future regulatory approaches within the digital asset space.\nRelated reading:\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-01-22T04:07:54-05:00","tag":"Exchanges","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

Here’s a breakdown of the situation.\nDigital assets, often touted for their decentralized nature, are facing increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies like the SEC. The SEC has long sought to bring “cryptocurrencies” under its regulatory umbrella, and its latest move involves taking legal action against Coinbase, one of the largest exchanges in the United States.\nThe SEC is currently prosecuting Binance, another major digital asset exchange, for similar unregistered securities violations as Coinbase, plus fraud allegations for serving US customers from banned overseas platforms.\nRelated reading: SEC’s Battle on “Unregistered Securities”: What is the Regulator Up To?\nThe SEC accuses Coinbase of operating as an unregistered securities broker and exchange, facilitating trading of digital assets that should have been registered as securities. The lawsuit, filed in June, claims that Coinbase violated federal securities laws by failing to register with the SEC.\nAn SEC spokesperson stated:\n“We’re pleased that yet another court has confirmed that, while the term ‘crypto’ may be relatively new, the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly 80 years still applies […] When intermediaries don’t register [as brokers], it’s investors who get hurt and the American financial markets that suffer. We will continue to protect investors against risks in the crypto markets when, as here, the securities laws are implicated.”\nIn June, Gary Gensler, the Chair of the SEC, stated in an interview with CNBC that platforms such as Coinbase, which “call themselves exchanges”, were “commingling a number of functions.”\nGensler added:\n“We don’t see the New York Stock Exchange operating a hedge fund.”\nDespite Coinbase’s attempts to have the lawsuit dismissed, the courts have sided with the SEC, allowing the case to move forward. U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the SEC’s claims have merit, rejecting Coinbase’s arguments to dismiss the complaints.\nJudge Failla stated in her ruling:\n“The ‘crypto’ nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years […] Coinbase has no control over a user’s crypto-assets or transactions via Wallet, which product simply provides the technical infrastructure for users to arrange transactions on other [decentralized exchanges] in the market.”\nJudge Failla determined that the SEC’s argument in the case met the standards set by the Howey test, a benchmark derived from a 1946 US Supreme Court case between the SEC and the WJ Howey Company, regarding investment contracts.\nShe added:\n“The court finds that the SEC has adequately pleaded that Coinbase customers engaged in transactions involving the Crypto-Assets that amounted to ‘investment contracts’ under Howey.”\nJudge Failla referenced lawsuits brought by the regulatory agency against Telegram and Terraform, highlighting: “Both the SEC and private litigants have brought several successful actions in this circuit predicated on crypto-assets falling within the Howey definition of an ‘investment contract’.”\nCoinbase has vowed to continue fighting the SEC’s allegations in court. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, expressed confidence in their legal arguments and stated, “We remain confident in our legal arguments, we look forward to proving we’re right, we are eager for the opportunity to take discovery from the SEC for the first time,”\n“We were prepared for this, and we look forward to uncovering more about the SEC’s internal views and discussions on crypto regulation.”\nThe outcome of this legal battle could have significant implications for the digital asset industry as a whole. If the SEC prevails, it could set a precedent for stricter regulation, potentially impacting other exchanges and digital asset firms.\nRelated reading: Regulatory “Siege” Underway For U.S. Exchanges — Warns Ex-SEC Official\nNews of the legal proceedings has had an impact on Coinbase’s market performance. Following the rulings, Coinbase’s shares experienced a decline, reflecting investor concerns over the outcome of the lawsuit and its potential ramifications for the company.\nAs the legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC unfolds, the bitcoin industry awaits the outcome with bated breath. The case could shape the future of regulation in the United States and beyond, with implications for investors, exchanges, and the broader financial markets.\nThe SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase marks a significant development in the ongoing debate over digital asset regulation. With the courts allowing the case to proceed, all eyes are on Coinbase as it prepares to defend itself against the allegations.

The letter, co-authored by Lummis and Wyden, states:\n“This interpretation threatens to criminalize Americans offering non-custodial crypto asset software services.”\nSamourai Wallet, known for its privacy-enhancing features like CoinJoin transactions, was accused of operating as an unregistered MSB and enabling money laundering.\nCoinJoin transactions involve multiple parties combining inputs and outputs, making it difficult to trace the flow of funds on the blockchain. However, Samourai never had direct control over their users’ funds, complicating their legal purview under the Bank Secrecy Act’s definition of “money transmission.”\nAccording to the senators, the DOJ’s interpretation risks stifling innovation by criminalizing developers of non-custodial digital asset software.\nThey argued that existing definitions of “money transmission” were clear and aimed to prevent unintended consequences, ensuring that entities like internet service providers or postal carriers aren’t inadvertently classified as MSBs.\nThe crux of the issue lies in the distinction between custodial and non-custodial services. Custodial services involve the service provider controlling users’ funds, while non-custodial services, like Samourai Wallet, allow users to retain control of their private keys.\nThe senators emphasized that subjecting developers of non-custodial digital asset software to potential criminal liability could undermine confidence in the DOJ’s commitment to the rule of law. Senator Lummis stated on X:\n“President Biden’s DOJ steamrolling the longstanding interpretation of FinCEN is legally wrong and threatens to criminalize Bitcoin software development in America.”\nHowever, the DOJ’s stance differs, arguing that a money transmitter need not have actual control of the funds being transferred.\nIt likens money transmission to data transfer via a USB cable or heat transfer in a frying pan, where the intermediary (i.e. the wallet provider) is viewed as facilitating the transaction without directly controlling the funds.\nIn April, the DOJ issued a warning to digital asset users about the potential risks of using wallets provided by non-regulated entities that do not adhere to Money Services Business registration and anti-money laundering standards set by U.S. federal law.\nThe department emphasized that such wallets could lead to financial losses and could face future prosecution.\nThe clash between privacy-focused bitcoin services and regulatory authorities highlights the ongoing debate over how to regulate the burgeoning digital asset industry. X user Seth For Privacy warns that government may also attack self-custody wallet providers:\n“While this government response is not yet enshrined in law or precedent, it paints a much clearer picture of how the state views not only the place of privacy tools, but even that of self-custodial wallet providers moving forward.”\nWhile regulators seek to combat illicit activities, there is a delicate balance to strike between enforcement and fostering innovation.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/15/2024","tag":"Government","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

I’m always going to stick with it. I’ve never sat on a horse that long, just so you know.”\nAccording to Tudor, one of the main factors that drew investor attention to bitcoin was the sudden onset of inflation and its perpetual cycle.\nHe mentions he sees bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, highlighting its fixed supply and the inability of humans to adjust that supply. He acknowledged the recent volatility of bitcoin’s price, noting that he had ridden the market up to its peak and then back down.\nTudor argues that the regulatory framework in the country is inherently adversarial towards bitcoin.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken strict actions against various digital asset exchanges due to their involvement in scams, internal issues, or their disregards towards the regulatory laws. Furthermore, the SEC has declined to categorize altcoins as registered securities, unlike stocks in the U.S.\nWhile the SEC chairman Gary Gensler has consistently regarded bitcoin as a commodity rather than a security, Tudor suggests that these factors contribute to the significant challenges faced by bitcoin in the U.S.\nWith the SEC classifying bitcoin as a commodity, the responsibility for bitcoin matters has shifted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The debate regarding whether bitcoin should be classified as a commodity or security remains ongoing.\nIn a recent hearing session in March 2023, Rostin Behnam, the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, stated that CFTC classifies ether and stablecoins as commodities alongside bitcoin.\nBehnam also added:\n“[Bitcoin is] unlike any commodity we have dealt with.”\nThis signifies the confusion among governing regulatory bodies over different asset classes of digital currencies and highlights the differences they have over digital currencies, which only adds to the chaos.\nAt the same time, lawmakers in the United States have been actively introducing bills in the Senate with the aim of simplifying bitcoin regulations nationwide. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have committed to supporting a bill specifically focused on bitcoin.\nThe recent collapse of FTX has put the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on high alert. Incidents like these, coupled with the SEC’s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase for facilitating trading of unregistered securities, have intensified the scrutiny surrounding the bitcoin industry.\nTudor believes price of bitcoin will continue to experience fluctuations until U.S. authorities cease their pursuit of digital asset exchanges and inflation rates stabilize. He insists that establishing consistent regulatory laws throughout the country is crucial for instilling confidence among current investors and making bitcoin a safer investment option.\nTudor mentioned:\n“Bitcoin has a real problem because in the United States, you have an entire regulatory apparatus against it.”\nPaul Tudor remains cautiously optimistic about bitcoin’s long-term potential and continues to maintain a small allocation to it in his portfolio. However, he highlighted the regulatory challenges and the evolving inflationary landscape as factors to consider.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-27T19:56:33-04:00","tag":"Bitcoin","author":"Alex Lari"},

Scheduled to happen roughly every four years, this event has far-reaching implications for the market and its investors. In the days leading up to the event, US Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds have been witnessing consecutive days of outflows.\nJust before the halving took place, there was a noticeable trend of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. According to recent reports, over $319 million has been withdrawn from U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs since April 12. Grayscale’s GBTC, a prominent player in the market, has been a significant contributor to this trend, experiencing substantial outflows.\nMatrixport, a leading authority in the Bitcoin market, highlighted the slowdown in key liquidity drivers for bitcoin, including stablecoin growth and inflows into U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs. Despite expectations of a bullish market sentiment surrounding the halving, the recent price pullbacks and mixed analyst predictions suggest uncertainty about its immediate impact on prices.\nMatrixport said:\n“Key liquidity drivers, such as stablecoin growth and US-listed Bitcoin ETF inflows, have slowed down – as we have mentioned for several weeks. ETF flows peaked on March 12, and four consecutive days of net outflows have recently been seen. Demand for US-listed Bitcoin ETFs appears saturated, as even a 10-15% decline in Bitcoin prices has not increased net inflows.”\nMatrixport noted that despite geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which typically prompt investors to allocate into Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, bitcoin’s price didn’t rise as expected. This situation tested Bitcoin’s status as a risk-off asset, but it somewhat failed the test as its price stagnated and even decreased instead of increasing.\nSimilarly, Bitcoin’s spot ETFs have registered a streak of withdrawals ahead of the halving. The U.S. spot ETFs saw net outflows totaling $4.3 million on Thursday, with a cumulative outflow exceeding $319 million since April 12. Grayscale’s GBTC, once again, played a significant role in these outflows.\nDespite the outflows, there were inflows into other ETFs like Fidelity’s FBTC and BlackRock’s IBIT, albeit not enough to offset the larger trend of withdrawals. BlackRock’s IBIT, in particular, experienced a significant drop in inflows, indicating a potentially saturated demand for U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs.\nBitcoin’s halving event, which reduces miner rewards by 50%, was executed by the network yesterday evening, and effectively cut the new block rewards down to 3.125 BTC. Scheduled against a backdrop of high inflation and interest rates, this halving differs significantly from previous ones. While some experts predict a post-halving price rally, others, including analysts from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, caution against expecting significant price increases, suggesting that the market may have already priced in the event.\nJP Morgan analysts said:\n“We do not expect bitcoin price increases post halving as it has been already priced in.”\nAndrew O’Neill, a digital asset analyst at S&P Global, remarked that he was “somewhat skeptical of the lessons that can be taken in terms of price prediction from previous halvings.” He added:\n“It’s only one factor in a multitude of factors that can drive price.”\nChris Gannatti, Global Head of Research at WisdomTree, highlights the significance of the halving, calling it “one of the biggest events in crypto this year.” However, skeptics view it as just a little technical change inflated by speculators to boost the digital asset’s price.\nThe recent trend of Bitcoin ETF outflows has coincided with a decline in bitcoin’s price, which currently trades around $63,700, down 13% from last month’s highs. Despite this, institutional investors, particularly BlackRock, continue to show interest in the market. BlackRock’s continuous inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs signals ongoing institutional buying activity, which suggests that the market cycle may still have room to grow.\nAccording to analyst Michael van de Poppe, although bitcoin’s price is experiencing a decline, the continuous inflow from institutions like BlackRock remains positive. This trend indicates a potential phase of sideways movement, with decreasing volatility seen as a positive indicator for the market.\nThe bearish divergence is still valid for #Bitcoin. I'm expecting us to be bottoming really soon, probably have done so or will be next week and are going for a period of sideways action. The volatility is slowing down and that's a great sign. pic.twitter.com/EDNSMN1If3\nAs Bitcoiners around the world celebrate bitcoin’s 4th halving event, the Bitcoin market is abuzz with anticipation and speculation. While recent trends of Bitcoin ETF outflows may have raised concerns, the continuous institutional interest suggests underlying confidence in the market’s future. Whether the halving will lead to a significant price rally remains to be seen, but one thing is certain – the world of Bitcoin is always full of surprises.\nWith each halving, bitcoin’s limited supply becomes more pronounced, underscoring its value as a scarce digital asset. As we navigate through these uncertain times, many believe that the halving event represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing evolution of Bitcoin and the wider digital asset ecosystem.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"04/20/2024","tag":"Analysis","author":"Alex Lari"},

Difficulty:\n- T\nThe price of bitcoin has plunged to its lowest point since March following a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States against Binance, the largest digital asset exchange in the world.\nThe SEC has accused Binance of committing several offenses that amount to avoiding regulations in the U.S. market, misrepresenting their activities, and endangering their investors’ assets.\nBinance and founder Changpeng Zhao are accused of:\nThe lawsuit amounts to a total of 13 separate charges and argues that Binance was fully aware of its wrongdoing and actively attempted to forestall regulatory intervention.\nChangpeng Zhao responded to the allegations by arguing that the SEC was only harming the United States as a place to do business within the digital asset world.\nAccording to the Binance CEO, the Commission should instead have taken a “thoughtful, nuanced approach” as opposed to the “blunt weapons of enforcement and litigation.\nIn a scathing attack on the SEC, Zhao argued that the “goal here was never to protect investors… instead, [it] appears to be to make headlines.”\nHe also demonstrated a genuine ambivalence towards the legal battle facing him and his company, making the case that “because Binance is not a U.S. exchange, the SEC’s actions are limited in reach.”\n🇺🇸 Highlights from Binance's response to the SEC: “Perhaps most surprising, the SEC’s actions undermine America’s role as a global hub for financial innovation and leadership.” “the Commission has determined to regulate with the blunt weapons of enforcement and litigation… pic.twitter.com/agayb7IAaH\nBinance called the accusations “baseless“, although evidence has been surfacing for some time that they may in fact have plenty of merit.\nReuters has previously released two reports that highlighted illegal activity and dishonest business practices from the digital asset exchange company.\nIndeed, evidence has surfaced that Binance was well aware that they were not playing by the rules, with internal messages confirming “we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA.”\nNot only this, but they deliberately attempted to slow enforcement down by complicating the methodology of categorizing securities.\nSearching for \"Emphasis added\" in the SEC complaint against Binance yields interesting results 😮 1) The company could not know if they were fully collateralized at any given time 2) They knew they were running a \"fking unlicensed security exchange in the US\" 3) They released… pic.twitter.com/hdBInHDutl\nWhilst altcoins have generally suffered the largest losses, the price of bitcoin has dropped below $26,000, its lowest since March 2023.\n$27,000 had been the support up until this point, but with that shattered, future price action could be difficult to predict.\nThere has been disappointment among Bitcoiners that the lawsuit has affected the price of bitcoin since laymen are apparently unaware of the delineation between bitcoin and altcoins.\nA common saying amongst Bitcoiners is “bitcoin not crypto,” which seeks to disentangle the world’s leading decentralized currency from the thousands of altcoins that make up the rest of the cryptocurrency industry.\nThe vast majority of these are pump-and-dump schemes, and none are decentralized, sound money digital currencies like bitcoin.\nBitcoin is the only digital asset with intrinsic value, decentralized in nature, and with the potential to fix the monetary system of the world.\nHowever, a layman does not necessarily understand that bitcoin does not belong in the same category as other digital assets.\nThere are calls to put a greater emphasis on educating people, including governments, about Bitcoin’s lone status as the only digital commodity.\nWe need to educate governments that #Bitcoin is #Bitcoin and everything else is a scam – Samson Mow pic.twitter.com/VwbxMUQwOB\nIf this is successful, the price of bitcoin may well be impervious to legal battles such as this, which don’t in any way affect the asset’s utility or security.\nWhen the world knows that bitcoin stands alone, its price may decouple from that of the altcoins.\nOnly then can it take its place as the world’s true reserve asset.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your

Offering seamless and secure contactless transactions, it simplifies Bitcoin’s usage in physical environments. This innovative fusion promises widespread adoption of Bitcoin, transforming the landscape of decentralized finance.\nWhen two devices are brought within a few inches of one another, a wireless technology known as NFC, or Near-Field Communication, allows them to connect. It is based on RFID technology and operates at 13.56 megahertz, enabling short-range data exchange. While in passive mode, one device generates the field and the other responds, both devices generate their radio frequency field in active mode, enabling bidirectional communication.\nNFC is replete with security features, such as authentication methods and encrypted communication, which lower the possibility of data interception. Common uses include access control systems that use NFC tags for door locks or secure area entry, and mobile payments, in which customers tap their smartphones against payment terminals.\nNFC is a versatile technology with a wide range of common uses. It also enables information sharing through tags implanted in posters or product packaging, providing instant access to URLs or contact details with a single tap.\nWith the use of NFC technology, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network (a layer-2 scaling solution meant to facilitate quicker and less expensive transactions) could become far more user-friendly and accessible. Through the integration of NFC with the Lightning Network, users will be able to transact instantly and with minimum expenses in real surroundings.\nUsers might start Lightning Network transactions with NFC-enabled Bitcoin wallets by only tapping their devices against compatible terminals. The payment procedure would be streamlined by this smooth connection, becoming as simple as tapping a contactless payment card.\nWith NFC-enabled Bitcoin wallets, users could initiate Lightning transactions simply by tapping their devices against compatible terminals. This integration would encourage the usage of Bitcoin in regular transactions in addition to increasing its acceptance as a digital currency. However, to guarantee the secure and dependable operation of NFC-based Lightning Network transactions, security factors need to be properly taken into account.\nTo ensure the security of NFC-based Bitcoin Lightning Network transactions, it’s crucial to implement a secure element within devices, encrypt data exchanges, enforce robust authentication measures, verify transaction validity, and safeguard against common security threats. These measures collectively ensure users can conduct instant, low-cost payments securely in physical environments.\nAs the first Bitcoin DIY contactless payment ring, the BoltRing revolutionizes the tap-to-pay experience by seamlessly integrating with Bitcoin Lightning. Whether utilized with a self-sovereign Bitcoin Lightning node or a commercial service provider, the BoltRing promises unparalleled convenience and accessibility, opening doors to a new era of digital transactions.\nBehind the BoltRing lies a collaborative effort fueled by developers and enthusiasts worldwide, including notable contributions from the Bolt Card Project and CoinCorner.\nEmbodying the ethos of financial democratization and freedom, the BoltRing not only offers cutting-edge payment capabilities but also empowers individuals to shape its development trajectory. While still in its nascent stages, with limited merchant support and technical complexities, BoltRing’s promise of contactless Bitcoin payments represents a significant leap toward mainstream adoption. With comprehensive documentation guiding users through setup and utilization, the BoltRing invites enthusiasts to explore its transformative potential and pioneer the future of digital finance.\n“The Bitcoin BoltRing is made of high-quality ceramic. It is water, dust and scratch resistant. Beautiful but still modest in its design, only the inside engravings reveal its true power.\nYour BoltRing is delivered in a hand-made wooden casket bedded in shredded euros :).”\nJoe Nakamoto showcases the BoltRing’s features and demonstrates its practical applications:\nAdditionally, Bitcoin BoltRing states:\n“We will donate a Bitcoinize Point of Sale Machine to a merchant that is willing to accept Bitcoin for every 10 BoltRings we sell!”\nThe Bitcoinize Point of Sale (POS) Machine revolutionizes Bitcoin adoption, empowering children in remote regions and over 150 businesses to embrace it as a medium of exchange. Utilizing Bolt Card open-source technology, it enables seamless contactless Bitcoin transactions, even for users without smartphones.\nThis initiative fosters financial inclusion and ignites a peaceful revolution, with the Lightning Network offering superior efficiency and accessibility compared to traditional banking systems.

They are circulated, and are customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance.\nUnder the leadership of Chairman Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been actively analyzing various digital assets to see whether they should be classed as securities, a continuing examination that has created a complex and dynamic situation for digital assets.\nImportantly, bitcoin enables anyone on the globe with access to electricity and internet to mine using their computational power to claim the newly generated bitcoin for finding the next block. Bitcoin uses proof-of-work as a consensus mechanism.\nAt a time when the regulatory status of other digital assets (at least in the United States) is still unclear, this distinction sets bitcoin apart from the uncertainty surrounding other digital assets and continues to be a significant driver of bitcoin’s legitimacy and growth in financial markets.\nThe eight-year anniversary of bitcoin’s commodity status in the U.S. represents a pivotal turning point in the development of the digital money and blockchain technology. Since its inception, bitcoin has come a long way, evolving from a specialized idea to an asset class that is widely recognized.\nIts recognition as a commodity highlights its ongoing influence and expanding acceptability in traditional finance. This milestone is a monument to bitcoin’s tenacity and its ability to impact the financial world in the years to come as the digital asset ecosystem continues to change and regulatory frameworks become more established.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-09-20T13:04:52-04:00","tag":"Markets","author":"Brian Kirubai"},

The company’s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reveal holdings exceeding $1.8 billion across various Bitcoin ETFs.\nAccording to the filings, SIG’s largest position is in Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC), with investments totaling over $1 billion alone. This significant allocation may underscore SIG’s confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a financial asset.\nThe disclosed investments highlight SIG’s strategic diversification across multiple Bitcoin ETF offerings, including those from Fidelity, ProShares, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Invesco Galaxy, and WisdomTree, among others.\nThis comprehensive approach showcases SIG’s commitment to capitalizing on different aspects of Bitcoin’s investment landscape.\nJulian Fahrer, CEO and co-founder of Apollo, expressed enthusiasm about SIG’s move, stating:\n“HUGE: Susquehanna International Group is the biggest Bitcoin ETF whale yet! $1.2 Billion held across 10 ETFs! The monsters are here.”\nThis sentiment reflects the broader sentiment of growing institutional interest in bitcoin investments.\nSIG’s investment in these ETFs marks a significant milestone in the traditional financial realm. With over $480 billion in assets under management, SIG’s move signals a strategic shift towards embracing bitcoin as part of a diversified investment strategy.\nSIG’s notable investment is in Grayscale’s GBTC, which alone constitutes a significant portion of SIG’s total Bitcoin ETF holdings. Additionally, SIG has strategically diversified its portfolio with investments in other prominent Bitcoin ETFs, such as Fidelity’s FBTC and ProShares’ BITO.\nMoreover, SIG’s disclosure comes amidst a broader trend of institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Market analysts anticipate more institutions to follow suit and disclose their Bitcoin ETF holdings, further validating the legitimacy of this new asset class.\nThe reported holdings also include indirect exposure to bitcoin’s spot price through investments in MicroStrategy stock, a company known for its significant bitcoin reserves.\nSIG’s investment in MicroStrategy indicates a dynamic approach to portfolio management, aligning its exposure with strategic objectives.\nWith traditional players like Legacy Wealth Management and United Capital Management of Kansas also investing in Bitcoin ETFs, this new asset is increasingly becoming a part of mainstream investment portfolios.\nThe recent performance of Bitcoin ETFs further underscores the growing interest from institutional investors.\nAfter a period of outflows, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded net gains, with inflows totaling $217 million on a single day. This renewed interest signals a potential shift in sentiment towards bitcoin among institutional investors.\nRobert Mitchnick of BlackRock predicts increasing demand for Bitcoin ETFs from institutional investors, citing a growing interest in the asset class.\nMajor institutions are reportedly conducting due diligence and preparing to enter the Bitcoin market, further validating Bitcoin’s status as a legitimate investment option.\nAs SIG and other institutions continue to embrace bitcoin, the digital asset market is entering a new phase of maturity and legitimacy.\nWith regulatory approval and increasing institutional participation, Bitcoin ETFs are becoming an accessible and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin’s price movements, paving the way for broader adoption and acceptance of the scarce digital asset in the financial mainstream.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/09/2024","tag":"Asset Protection","author":"Alex Lari"},

According to the report, regulators in Hong Kong have completed their preparations for the trading of virtual assets within the special administrative region. They are now ready to accept applications from virtual asset trading platforms.\nCCTV, China’s prominent state broadcaster, is believed to reach a massive audience of over 1 billion individuals through its diverse programs. Surprisingly, the 98-second segment on digital assets did not express any explicitly negative views.\nThis stands in sharp contrast to the strict regulations imposed by authorities in mainland China, which encompass a complete prohibition on bitcoin mining and exchange. However, the ownership of bitcoin is presently permitted.\nDuring the segment, Zhonghui Cai, a representative of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), discussed the challenges involved in regulating virtual asset providers. These challenges include cybersecurity concerns, ensuring the security of clients’ assets, and addressing potential conflicts of interest between platforms and clients.\nFollowing the completion of a consultation period, Hong Kong received a total of 152 written submissions regarding the policy. According to an official statement, a significant majority of respondents expressed agreement with the proposal to allow licensed trading platform operators to cater to retail investors.\nThe regulatory body encouraged digital assets firms to register with them. However, it emphasized that those who choose not to register should proceed with an orderly closure of their business in Hong Kong.\nFurthermore, the announcement reiterated that the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has not yet granted approval to any virtual asset trading platform. It also clarified that most available trading services are not regulated by the SFC. Additionally, exchanges in Hong Kong are limited to listing only a small number of digital assets.\nThe inclusion of “virtual assets” discussions in state media received praise from various individuals, including Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance. Expressing his excitement on Twitter, he described it as a significant development, that has the Chinese-speaking communities standing on their toes.\nCCTV (China Central Television) just broadcasted crypto.

The initial idea is to have a virtual monument on the site which can be viewed using tech such as smartphones and tablets, with an app developed by Raccoon World.\nThe hope is that an actual statue might one day follow, to be located on Lenin’s empty plinth. The same group is raising a petition to present to Kiev municipal authorities, the Kyiv City State Administration, in the hope a real statue can be mounted at the site.\nSatoshi Nakamoto Republic, Andriy Moroz, co-founder of the group, suggested that Satoshi Nakamoto symbolizes the future:\n“The monument to Lenin was a symbol of last centuries that had already passed, leaving conflicting feelings in the hearts of people. Satoshi and the decentralization of society are a new era and new opportunities,” Moroz, who also serves as the First Ambassador of the Republic, told Radio Free Europe.\nThe group’s plans don’t end there, with the announcement that they are looking to establish Satoshi Nakamoto City, which will be located on an island, once a suitable location has been found. Once established they plan to start a blockchain “republic” of their own.\nIt’s been reported that the Nakamoto statue concept is open for all comers, including at present Beijing, Dubai, New York, and Tokyo.\nOnly Satoshi Nakamoto can reveal his true identity, or so say Ethereum News, or perhaps the CIA may be helpful. This was certainly the view of Daniel Oberhouse, a Motherboard writer, who actually went to those lengths by asking both the FBI and the CIA if they could shed any light on the enigmatic Bitcoin creators whereabouts.\nRebuffed by the FBI, he did, however, have more success -at least receiving a response- with the US’ own enigma, The Central Intelligence Agency. Unfortunately, the agency was less than helpful:\n“The request has been rejected, with the agency stating that it can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the requested documents.”\nApparently such a statement, according to an ex CIA operative, actually has a name and is a procedure used when the agency has no desire to look into a query due to security issues. A rejection of a request on security grounds implicitly suggests that the documents the requester are seeking indeed exist, but to confirm their existence would mandate their disclosure.\nIt’s called the “Glomar Response.” And for now, the search continues.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-03T20:52:25-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Harold Vandelay"},

Recent reports indicate a significant surge in demand for bitcoin, potentially signaling a supply shock that could drive prices higher in the near future.\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, demand for Bitcoin from long-term holders, often referred to as “HODLers,” has surpassed miner issuance for the first time in history. This unprecedented phenomenon suggests a notable shift in bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics. Analysts note that the cohort of long-term holders is adding around 200,000 BTC per month, far exceeding the monthly issuance of approximately 28,000 BTC.\nCryptoQuant head of research, Julio Moreno, emphasizes the significance of this trend, stating, demand for the flagship digital asset “has become more important than supply.”\nInterestingly, the data reveals that known exchange addresses now hold only 9.8% of bitcoin’s total circulating supply, indicating a decline in supply on exchanges as investors adopt a long-term holding strategy.\nThe diminishing supply of bitcoin on exchanges could potentially lead to a supply shock if demand were to suddenly surge. A supply shock occurs when the readily available supply of an asset on exchanges abruptly drops while demand increases. This buying pressure could drive prices higher, particularly as short sellers are forced to cover their positions to avoid liquidation.\nThe impending Bitcoin halving event adds another layer of significance to the current market dynamics. Scheduled to occur on April 20, the halving will cut the coinbase reward miners receive per block found on the network in half, reducing it to 3.125 BTC. This halving, programmed into Bitcoin’s monetary policy to occur once every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), effectively halves the supply of newly minted BTC entering the market.\nOpinions among digital asset executives vary regarding the potential impact of the halving event. Arthur Hayes, former head of BitMEX, anticipates price declines before and after the halving, citing limited dollar liquidity during this period. However, Marathon CEO Fred Thiel suggests that the halving’s impact may already be priced in, pointing to successful spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approvals as evidence.\nHistorical data on previous halving events provides insights into potential market trends. In each instance of historical halvings, bitcoin prices have surged, reaching higher highs and higher lows. Analysts emphasize the importance of considering supply and demand dynamics in evaluating bitcoin’s performance.\nAs the Bitcoin halving event approaches, the market is witnessing a surge in demand, potentially signaling a supply shock that could drive prices higher. With demand outpacing miner issuance and decreasing exchange reserves, market dynamics suggest a bullish outlook for bitcoin in the near future. As investors eagerly await the halving event, all signs point to a potential price rally ahead.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-04-12T12:30:00-04:00","tag":"Analysis","author":"Alex Lari"},

Just like physical cash in the real world, direct digital value exchange can reduce costs, promote competition, and drive innovation by allowing entrepreneurs to price goods closer to marginal production costs.\nDespite what some Keynesians might tell you, deflation is good. And no, people won’t starve hoarding money.\nEmerging decentralized protocols like Nostr and the Lightning Network are catalyzing a paradigm shift towards micro-economies built on direct value exchange.\nFeatures like “zapping” bitcoin directly to others’ lightning wallets enable micropayments for high-quality content and services, incentivizing value creation and challenging the traditional advertising-driven model.\nThese protocols empower individuals to seamlessly transact value across borders and communities, facilitating frictionless economic interactions that were previously impeded by intermediaries and geographic boundaries.\nWhether splitting bills with friends from different countries or compensating a content creator on the other side of the globe, these decentralized micro-economies unlock new realms of economic cooperation and value creation.\nThe possibilities for these micro-economies is endless. All kind of builders, innovators, and creators will become the driving force, fostering a meritocratic system where quality and authenticity are rewarded.\nThis empowers individuals, cultivates high-quality communities, and enables new business models and revenue streams beyond traditional rent-seeking.\nBitcoin is not an investment. It is savings.\nEveryone desires the form of savings that’s widely adopted by others. While likes and clicks have their appeal, they can’t put food on the table. The true measure of worth lies in value, not mere digital affirmations.\nIt’s crucial to remember that if something is free, you’re likely the product being sold. To truly benefit from your online activities, prioritize protocols over platforms, allowing you to create value rather than becoming a mere data point to be exploited.\nWhile governments may not relinquish fiat currencies soon, the democratization of the internet through decentralized micro-economies promotes freedom of expression, individual sovereignty, and incentivizes the creation of more value over time.\nAs these technologies evolve, we may witness a paradigm shift in how value is created, distributed, and appreciated online, shaping a more equitable, abundant, and vibrant digital future.\nBitcoin exchanges are important and amazing for allowing people to buy and sell bitcoin, acting as on and off ramps to fiat currency.\nHowever, they can also be captured or censored. This is why individuals should use exchanges to gain custody of their bitcoin, and then flex their God given right to manage the tools they possess according to their discretion.\nWhen someone holds the private keys to their bitcoin they are exercising true sovereignty. An ETF, while providing exposure to bitcoin’s price movements, represents a cucked version of Bitcoin.\nAn ETF is suitable for those focused solely on number-go-up, but lacking the empowering properties of true self-custody and sovereignty that make bitcoin truly revolutionary.\nYou can have the power. Bitcoin is not for everyone, but it is for anybody that wants to use it. All you have to do is provide others with value.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-05-11T12:26:40-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Conor Chepenik"},

The insights provided by various sources may bring to light the potential implications of the Japanese yen’s crisis on Bitcoin’s trajectory.\nThe weakening Japanese yen, marked by a 2.39% decrease over the past 30 days, has sparked discussions about its implications for global financial markets.\nDante Cook, head of business at Swan Bitcoin, highlights the significance of this trend, stating: “This spells disaster for Japan and the U.S. potentially.”\nHe underscores Japan’s position as the largest holder of U.S. treasuries, emphasizing the potential repercussions of a currency devaluation, noting:\n“Japan is the largest holder of US treasuries, only 4% of its forex reserves are in gold, the rest are almost exclusively in US Treasuries.\nThe potential sell-off of U.S. treasuries by Japan in an effort to shore up its currency spells disaster not only for Japan but potentially for the U.S. as well.”\nAmidst the uncertainty, Bitcoin emerges as a potential safe haven for investors seeking refuge from traditional securities.\nCook suggests that the market may witness a surge of liquidity, potentially favoring Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. He notes, “Bitcoin has already been enjoying a massive liquidity influx from institutional investors,” indicating growing confidence in this new asset class.\nThe approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January has further bolstered Bitcoin’s momentum.\nThese ETFs have collectively seen total net inflows of $11.78 billion, reflecting institutional interest in the Bitcoin market. Cook predicts, “I see this as just the beginning of another massive wall of liquidity entering the markets,” highlighting the potential for sustained growth.\nThe current state of uncertainty in traditional financial markets has also led to increased interest in riskier altcoins. Cook suggests that investors may explore alternative avenues beyond Bitcoin, seeking higher returns amidst market volatility.\nAs Bitcoin continues to navigate through complex market dynamics, its role in global finance is evolving. The bitcoin’s resilience and growing acceptance highlight its potential to redefine financial paradigms.\nCook asserts, “Nothing stops this train,” underscoring Bitcoin’s resilience amidst changing market conditions. Cook also notes Argentina’s entry into Bitcoin mining, highlighting the ongoing evolution of game theory in the Bitcoin space.\nMany analysts have offered insights regarding Bitcoin’s potential for experiencing a significant price surge. Ki Young Ju, Founder & CEO at cryptoquant, said:\n“Bitcoin network fundamentals could support a market cap three times its current size compared to the last cyclical top, potentially sustaining a price of $265K.”\nCrypto Ceaser, an analyst and trader, shared the same sentiments, saying: “Whilst this target is particularly high it is a legitimate target and technically a diminished return (measured from low to high).”\nDaan Crypto, another analyst and trader, added: “It’s still at relatively low levels compared to last cycle. Likely to see that change as time goes on and price leaves this range.”\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/10/2024","tag":"Asset Protection","author":"Alex Lari"},

SEC approval boosted bitcoin’s value, as Bitcoin soared to a record high above $73,000 in March.\nOne key aspect of CME’s offering is the integration of both the spot and derivatives markets, enabling more sophisticated trading strategies such as arbitrage and basis trading.\nThis integration streamlines the trading process and enhances efficiency for institutional investors, who value regulated platforms with diverse trading options.\nObserving this trend, Vetle Lunde, a seasoned analyst at K33 Research highlighted the astonishing number of firms currently invested in Bitcoin ETFs, stating:\n“According to 13F reporting, 937 professional firms were invested in U.S. spot ETFs as of March 31. In comparison, gold ETFs had 95 professional firms invested in their first quarter.”\nDespite the dominance of offshore exchanges like Binance in spot Bitcoin trading, CME aims to carve out its niche by providing institutional investors with a regulated alternative.\nBy leveraging its decades-long track record and established relationships with institutional clients, CME seeks to attract a significant share of the institutional demand for Bitcoin trading.\nAccording to reports, CME has been in talks with traders expressing strong interest in trading bitcoin in a regulated environment.\nThe introduction of spot Bitcoin trading would complement CME’s existing futures products, providing investors with a comprehensive suite of offerings for bitcoin trading.\nInstitutional investors are more inclined to use CME than platforms like Coinbase due to the exchange’s reputation for transparency and trustworthiness.\nBy tapping into the extraordinary demand from institutional clients, CME aims to significantly boost its bitcoin exposure, catering to the needs of large financial groups such as hedge funds, family offices, and pension funds.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/17/2024","tag":"Adoption","author":"Alex Lari"},

Over the last 15 years, the network has rapidly risen from a niche technological experiment to a global settlement layer, sparking further bitcoin adoption.\nThis decentralized system of value, written off as “dead” hundreds of times, is poised to revolutionize how businesses manage their transactions, protect their profits and create new opportunities for entrepreneurs.\nWith hundreds of institutions acquiring billions of dollars of the recently launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, the interest in Bitcoin at the organizational level is undeniably growing. This article examines why all businesses – from large companies to smaller mom-and-pop shops – need Bitcoin.\nMany of the advantages of Bitcoin arise from the disadvantages inherent to the fiat system.\nWhile intermediaries or brokers have their place in various industries, the number of misappropriated resources in our economies does not lead to greater abundance. One of the many ways Bitcoin resolves this issue is by streamlining payments.\nBitcoin’s lower transaction fees are one clear benefit for businesses receiving bitcoin as payment.\nWhile fees on the base layer can fluctuate significantly based on demand, the Lightning Network provides low-cost transactions that can be much less than those from traditional payment processors. Even on-chain payments are not prohibitively expensive for large organizations.\nPayments can be settled in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks inherent to current processes, and often for lower cost as well! For a business processing thousands of dollars daily (or more), this fee reduction can result in substantial savings over the long term.\nBitcoin operates independently from centralized financial institutions, helping businesses reach a global market without worrying about regional financial restrictions or unstable local currencies.\nEspecially in regions where a significant portion of the population remains unbanked, Bitcoin opens avenues for these individuals to participate in global economics.\nBitcoin’s border-agnostic approach makes it possible for businesses to reach new customers. It also allows individuals to transmit money across borders at very low fees (using scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network) and enables unbanked entrepreneurs to reach global audiences with their products.\nBitcoin transactions are irreversible – once a transaction is added to the ledger, it cannot be reversed. This irreversibility extends to Lightning as well.\nThis characteristic significantly reduces fraud and eliminates chargebacks, protecting the seller from financial loss due to fraudulent claims or payment disputes.\nIn addition to being a more cost-effective means of payment, there are technological advantages for businesses that use Bitcoin.\nMany have experienced the frustration of waiting in a bank line, having an account locked or closed, or waiting days for money to land in their bank account. Again, Bitcoin fixes this.\nAs mentioned, traditional bank transfers can take days, especially in cross-border transactions. Bitcoin transactions are processed within seconds or minutes. Faster transactions can improve cash flow—a crucial advantage for many businesses.\nRecently, I had difficulty paying a freelance editor living in another country. Because my editor lived in a place deemed questionable by either my bank or the payment processors my bank was connected to, one of them decided that the transaction was too dangerous to complete.\nBoth parties on either side of the deal wanted it to happen, but the intermediaries had the final say.\nThis situation was frustrating for both of us. My editor’s payment was delayed, and I had to spend longer than I care to admit on the phone trying to resolve the issue.\nUnfortunately, my editor doesn’t like Bitcoin yet (hopefully, that will change as he works on more of my podcast interviews!). What could have been resolved instantly over the Lightning Network, took well over a week to complete the payment.\nThis was not because of the technology but because of the institutions that decided what was a safe way – or not – for me to spend “my” money.\nBitcoin makes transactions quick, but it slows the leak of your financial energy.\nWhether inflation remains stubbornly high (it will) or goes back down to the 2% target (it won’t), Bitcoin offers the ability to preserve and even grow a business’s profits. In addition to the benefits of accepting bitcoin as payment, bitcoin is also an excellent asset for protecting the value of a business’s treasury.\nUsing a multi-sig setup, no single person in an organization can run away with the private keys that control a business’s bitcoin. A profitable business that holds bitcoin on its balance sheet over the long term will likely outpace its competitors in that same time frame.\nCompanies that accept bitcoin are often viewed as modern and adaptable — traits highly valued by customers today.\nOffering bitcoin as a payment option can differentiate a business from its rivals and attract consumers looking for companies that align with their values. And if a business pays in bitcoin (either salary or bonuses), this may attract and retain more forward-thinking employees.\nFinally, businesses may also gain first-mover advantage in their specific niche within their industry or community.\nIn a recent interview on Business Bitcoinization, Block Rewards CEO Scott Dedels noted:\n“If you’re operating a small or medium-sized enterprise, you do have the flexibility to take a step out and be different and do whatever it is you think is going to benefit your company.”\nBusiness owners who take the time to understand the benefits of a Bitcoin strategy can position their business as a company that accepts bitcoin in their part of the world. This will likely bring in new customers, undoubtedly raising the public’s awareness of Bitcoin.\nBitcoin will not be a silver bullet for your organization’s growth. To quote Jameson Lopp, “Bitcoin isn’t a get rich quick scheme, it’s a ‘don’t get poor slowly’ scheme.”\nBitcoin is available to any business at any time. For those who want to take advantage of easier, quicker, cheaper payments and the ability to accelerate growth by years, if not decades, choose Bitcoin.\nThe network will continue to grow, but it will be much more advantageous to those who begin learning and implementing it today.\nFor more Bitcoin and business content, check out the six ways any business can benefit from Bitcoin or listen to “Business Bitcoinization”.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-05-18T08:27:00-04:00","tag":"Asset Protection","author":"Josh Friedeman"},

This surge in bitcoin spot ETFs volume reflects a growing interest in these relatively new financial instruments within the digital asset market.\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, shared the significance of March’s trading volume on social media platform X, calling it “March Madness.” He noted that it was almost triple the combined volume of January and February.\nHowever, the analyst remained cautious about predicting future trends, stating:\n“I can’t imagine April will be bigger, but who knows.”\nHowever, recent trends indicate a cooling down of spot Bitcoin ETFs’ popularity, with daily trading volume dropping to $5.4 billion, down 36% from its peak in early March. Despite positive net inflows into bitcoin investment products last week, GBTC’s outflows persist, impacting bitcoin prices, which experienced a $5,000 correction, trading at around $65,000.\nDespite the overall success of spot bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale’s GBTC fund faced considerable challenges. Since its launch in January, GBTC has experienced total outflows surpassing $15 billion, indicating significant selling pressure. This selling pressure intensified earlier in March following reports of Genesis Global Holdco LLC’s potential sale of 35.9 million GBTC shares, valued at around $2 billion.\nAnalysts observed fluctuations in GBTC’s outflows, with a drop from $642.5 million on March 18 to $104.9 million on March 28, suggesting a potential slowdown in selling pressure. However, recent data showed a resurgence, with outflows surpassing daily averages, reaching $302.6 million. James Seyffart writes:\n“$302.6 million outflow for GBTC today — honestly higher than I expected. I thought this would have slowed down by now.”\nThese outflows have contributed to a 46% decrease in GBTC’s bitcoin holdings since January.\nMeanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC emerged as leaders in bitcoin holdings among spot bitcoin ETFs, collectively amassing over $27 billion worth of BTC. Despite Grayscale’s struggles, BlackRock and Fidelity’s ETFs continue to attract significant inflows, with assets under management reaching around $18 billion and $10 billion, respectively.\nAccording to recent data by James Seyffart, IBIT has just taken over the volume market share from GBTC. Balchunas comments on this achievement, stating:\n“While all of the ETFs won in terms of being profitable hits, IBIT won the volume race and is officially the GLD of bitcoin. It’s basically a wrap.”\nGreat chart from @JSeyff that shows how $IBIT has just taken over the volume market share from $GBTC. While all of the ETFs won in terms of being profitable hits, $IBIT won the volume race and is officially the $GLD of bitcoin.

Additionally, spot bitcoin ETFs returned to net outflows after a week of net inflows, with Monday’s outflows totaling $85.7 million, primarily driven by Grayscale’s fund shedding $302.6 million.\nAs the digital asset market braces for the Bitcoin halving event scheduled for April 20, investors remain vigilant amid market uncertainties and the evolving landscape of spot bitcoin ETFs.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-04-03T12:58:02-04:00","tag":"Analysis","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

With previous halving events showing significant impacts on bitcoin’s price, all eyes are on whether history will repeat itself.\nWith just 10 days left until the halving, bitcoin’s price remains steady around the $70,000 mark. Different analysts predict a potential surge post-halving, reaching a cycle top of above between $150,000 and $300,000. This optimistic outlook is fueled by the historical trends observed after previous halving events.\nA report by Bitfinex titled “Bitfinex Alpha Report” outlines a straightforward regression model predicting a 160% post-halving price surge in the next 14 months. However, the report acknowledges the complexity introduced by bitcoin already reaching an all-time high before the halving—a first in Bitcoin’s history. This anomaly brings both bullish indicators and uncertainties to the market dynamics.\nBitfinex analysts said:\n“Using a straightforward regression model, we predict a 160% post-halving price surge in the next 14 months, taking the price to between $150,000 – $169,000.”\n“The current cycle stands out from all previous cycles because the price of Bitcoin has already reached a new all-time high (ATH), even before the halving. This anomaly could be interpreted as a bullish indicator, but it also introduces a level of uncertainty in the market dynamics.”\nOne crucial factor affecting bitcoin‘s post-halving trajectory is the active engagement of Short-Term Holders (STHs) at higher price levels. These holders, including new spot buyers and institutional investors through spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), contribute to the current range-bound volatility. Additionally, the broader macroeconomic landscape, including job market growth and Federal Reserve policies, adds further complexity to bitcoin’s price movements.\nThe Bitfinex report indicates that approximately 1.875 million bitcoin, which amounts to 9.5% of the total circulating supply, have been bought at prices exceeding $60,000. A notable portion of these purchases is attributed to short-term holders, including new spot buyers, as well as around 508,000 bitcoin held in US spot ETFs.\nThis suggests active engagement from short-term holders at elevated price levels, reflecting changes in ownership dynamics influenced by market activity and institutional participation through spot ETFs. Moreover, the increase in movements of big entities known as whales indicates a transition in the market cycle towards gradual distribution of dormant supply and profit-taking activities.\nAnalyzing past halving cycles provides valuable insights into bitcoin’s potential future performance. The report highlights that historically, bitcoin has experienced substantial price rallies following halving events. For instance, after the 2020 halving, BTC surged 700% within 11 months, reaching a peak of $69,000. These trends offer a guideline for expectations regarding bitcoin’s post-halving market behavior.\nNotably, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, suggests that bitcoin prices could see a sharp decline during the halving period due to quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve. However, he emphasizes that this could potentially ignite a ‘firesale’ of bitcoin, leading to new opportunities for investors.\nIn a blog post dated April 8, Hayes expressed his thoughts:\n“That is why I believe Bitcoin and crypto prices in general will slump around the halving […] It will add propellant to a raging firesale of crypto assets.”\nThe influx of investments from United States spot Bitcoin ETFs has significantly contributed to bitcoin’s price rally. These ETFs have amassed a substantial portion of bitcoin’s circulating supply, highlighting the growing institutional interest in the bitcoin market.\nAs of February 15, Bitcoin ETFs constituted around 75% of new investments in bitcoin, crossing the $50,000 threshold, as per CryptoQuant findings. Since inception, these ETFs have gathered 841,900 BTC, valued at $59.2 billion, equivalent to 4.28% of bitcoin’s circulating supply. Dune Analytics projects a yearly absorption of 2.6% of bitcoin supply based on recent accumulation trends. Notably, last week, Bitcoin ETFs saw over $500 million in net inflows, with $286 million on April 8 alone.\nAs the Bitcoin halving draws near, analysts and investors brace themselves for potential price fluctuations and market dynamics. While historical trends offer valuable insights, the unique circumstances surrounding this halving inject a level of uncertainty into bitcoin’s future trajectory. Nevertheless, the overall sentiment remains optimistic, with many analysts predicting a significant post-halving surge, potentially propelling bitcoin’s price to new heights.\nIn the words of Bitfinex analysts:\n“This estimation aligns with the observed trend of diminishing percentage increases following each halving event. With a conservative estimate placing the price of BTC at between $57,000 and $65,000 at the time of the halving, a 160 percent price increase would lead to BTC price ranging from approximately $150,000 to $169,000 at the peak of the cycle.”\nWith careful observation and strategic decision-making, investors await the outcome of this pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s journey towards mainstream adoption.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-04-10T12:33:06-04:00","tag":"Analysis","author":"Alex Lari"},

Brian Hill and championed in the Senate by Republican state Sen. Bill Coleman. It draws inspiration from model policies advocated by the state-focused bitcoin mining advocacy group, Satoshi Action Fund.\nThe bill’s journey from proposal to law has been swift, having recently passed through both the Senate and House in Oklahoma on April 24.\nIts rapid progression reflects the strong support for digital asset rights within the state, highlighting the state’s commitment to fostering innovation and economic growth.\nThe enactment of this bill is a significant victory for bitcoin enthusiasts, particularly at a time when federal regulation in the United States remains uncertain.\nThe news of this passage comes amidst the community’s concern over potential federal restrictions on self-custody of bitcoin, prompted by recent crackdowns on digital asset mixing services and privacy tools.\nWhile the fear of a federal ban on self-custody looms, Oklahoma’s ‘Bitcoin Rights’ bill proactively safeguards the right to self-custody bitcoin, whether in self-hosted or hardware wallets.\nMoreover, it ensures that using bitcoin to purchase legal goods and services does not incur any extra taxes solely based on digital asset payments.\nFurthermore, the bill legalizes bitcoin mining activities for residents, both at home and on an industrial scale, with the condition of compliance with local noise ordinances.\nOklahoma’s potential for a digital asset mining hub has been underscored by the recent announcement by Polaris Technologies to invest $100 million in a 200 megawatt mining facility outside of Tulsa.\nBy protecting the right to mine bitcoin in Oklahoma, the bill prevents potential bans on bitcoin mining, similar to those observed in states like New York and North Carolina.\nThe legislation, set to take effect on November 1, 2024, also ensures that miners and node operators are not required to obtain money transmitter licenses, reducing regulatory burdens and promoting innovation.\nDennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, hailed the enactment of the bill as a historic moment for bitcoin rights.

The company specializes in the design and production of ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) high-performance computing chips, with a significant focus on the Bitcoin mining industry.\nCanaan is renowned for launching the first ASIC-powered Bitcoin mining machine in 2013 under the brand name Avalon.\nThe company’s unaudited financial results for Q1, ending March 31, have revealed a series of noteworthy achievements, including surpassing revenue expectations and narrowing net losses.\nCanaan Inc. has exceeded revenue expectations for Q1, reporting a total revenue of $35.1 million, marking a 6% increase from its initial guidance of $33 million. This achievement underscores the company’s ability to adapt and thrive in a challenging market environment.\nNangeng Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Canaan, commented on the strong performance, stating:\n“Canaan has demonstrated resilience and strategic foresight […] We successfully delivered 3.4 million Thash/s of computing power sold while driving our mining revenue to an impressive US$10.5 million.\nThis success is attributed to strong sales and improved mining operations. The new A1566 mining machines and ongoing demand for the A14 series, even after the halving, highlight the company’s innovation and ability to respond to market needs.\nDespite volatile hashrate price and tough economic conditions, Canaan Inc. has made significant progress in narrowing its net loss.\nIn Q1, the company recorded a net loss of $39.4 million, which represents a substantial improvement of 71.7% sequentially and 53.3% year-over-year. This narrowing of losses reflects the company’s efforts to enhance its financial performance and operational efficiency.\nZhang emphasized the company’s persistent sales efforts and the optimization of mining operations as key factors contributing to the improved financial results.\nHe also highlighted upcoming opportunities, mentioning that Canaan is poised to take advantage of new opportunities with the upcoming large shipments of the A14 series and the introduction of the A1566 Avalon Miner.\nIn addition to revenue growth and loss reduction, Canaan Inc. experienced an unrealized gain of $33.6 million in Q1, attributed to bitcoin’s price surge. This gain helped offset operational losses, demonstrating the company’s ability to leverage market dynamics to its advantage.\nJames Jin Cheng, Canaan’s CFO, highlighted the company’s commitment to financial transparency, stating:\n“With the adoption of new accounting standards in 2024, we now reflect the fair value of our crypto assets, enhancing our financial transparency and balance sheet strength under increased bitcoin prices.\nLooking ahead, Canaan Inc. remains optimistic about its future prospects. The company expects continued growth in mining revenue and computing power sales, driven by the introduction of new mining machines and sustained demand for existing products.\nThe recent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in key markets and the bullish cycle for bitcoin are expected to further bolster Canaan’s performance in the coming quarters.\nThe company maintains its guidance for the second and third quarters of 2024, expecting total revenues of approximately $70 million for each quarter.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/19/2024","tag":"Asics","author":"Alex Lari"},

With this integration, Coinbase customers can now instantly send, receive, or pay with bitcoin on Lightning directly from their Coinbase account,” the exchange writes.\nFacilitating Coinbase’s integration of the Lightning Network is Los Angeles-based Lightspark. Established in 2022, the company offers enterprise-grade Lightning Network products.\nCoinbase’ co-founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong, shared the news on X, stating:\n“Excited to be live on the Bitcoin Lightning network – let’s get every transaction under 1 second and 1 cent to bring in the next wave of adoption.”\nThe exchange believes that the future of payments is digital assets, and it is committed to “building and scaling faster, cheaper, and more secure payments” for the Bitcoin Network.\n“By partnering with Lightspark to integrate the Lightning Network, Coinbase is demonstrating its support of Bitcoin while remaining focused on decreasing both transaction times and fees,” the official press release explains.\nOn the other hand, David Marcus, the CEO and co-founder of Lightspark, also expressed enthusiasm for the integration. He stated:\n“We’re so thrilled to be part of this journey with you to bring Lightning to 100s of millions of people in over 100 countries. Big milestone for the entire network and for Bitcoin. Let’s go!”\nCoinbase customers interested in using the Lightning Network can switch between Bitcoin mainnet and the Lightning Network when entering the amount of bitcoin they want to send. They will then need to include a Lightning “invoice” address, which would be generated by the receiver.\nNotably, users won’t need to run a node, manage a channel, or deal with liquidity. Both Coinbase and Lightspark will handle these aspects, while Coinbase manages keys and security.\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase has been exploring Lightning Network integration since last fall. Although Coinbase met with different Lightning Network providers, Lightspark fit the bill, offering all of the features they were looking for.\nHowever, Coinbase isn’t the sole digital asset exchange utilizing the Lightning Network.\nBinance, its rival, announced Lightning Network integration in July last year. Additionally, exchanges like Bitfinex, Kraken, and Bitstamp have integrated or have plans for integrating the Lightning Network in the future.\nMoreover, the Lightning Network is supported by multiple merchants, wallets, applications, and services, enabling users to make fast and convenient Bitcoin payments.\nWith more users and businesses embracing this innovative technology, the Lightning Network is anticipated to expand further.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/01/2024","tag":"Adoption","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

Another shuttered after outright fraud, deception, and criminal behavior. Yet more feeling the heat of digital bank runs.\nTo outside observers, the world of Bitcoin and its crypto-offspring must seem daunting and chaotic.\nAnd while that may be true at various altcoin exchanges that have paused withdrawals, shooed away auditors, or just flat-out stolen money, the Bitcoin protocol’s blocks continue to tick on.\nFor those who have Bitcoin private keys in their self-custody, the daily noise of “crypto markets” and potential exchange insolvency is akin to a massive volcanic eruption on Mars. There may be some small effect in the universe, but nothing that will re-order your life.\nAs Bitcoin researcher and orange pill king Pierre Rochard has stated, the fluctuations and volatility of Bitcoin’s price are the result of people FOMOing in and out of the asset while the base layer remains stable and unperturbed. Those who hold their keys and verify with their own full node are safe from the tumult.\nThough many sit pretty with Satoshis in self-custody, there are still millions — potentially hundreds of millions globally — that continue to hold their Bitcoin on exchanges, yield providers, or neobanks (which may not even allow you to withdraw).\nAnd this, unfortunately, is a causal effect of the fiat mindset.\nToo many approach Bitcoin as merely an alternative investment like gold, real estate, or a long-term treasury bond. As such, they are keen to deposit fiat money into what is considered a “trusted” platform and leave it there, following the asset appreciation in the fiat denomination. When it goes higher, they may sell. If it dips, they’ll likely also sell and mark it a “bad” investment.\nCrypto exchanges understand this and market their products accordingly, making the online dashboard glisten like a reactive bank statement, and enticing you with yield products or utility tokens as a reward for trusting them with your deposits.\nThe more responsible exchanges will earmark your deposits with custodians and keep them (theoretically) safe. Others, like now-indicted Sam Bankman-Fried at FTX, use those deposits to gamble on other trades with their hedge fund, spend money on politicians, or buy stadium-naming rights for some awful sport. Ad Infinitum.\nThe latter case provides a perfect case for self-custody, but the former should as well.\nThe marketing around exchanges makes it all the more confusing. You hear phrases like trading or investing when it comes to Bitcoin when it should be simplified to sovereign saving.\nThe paradigm shift afforded by Satoshi’s innovation was the ability to claim absolute and sovereign ownership of digital assets on a decentralized ledger. Over a long period of time, the stability of the protocol allows it to become a savings technology rather than just a stock you intend to buy or sell.\nAnd that’s where reliance on exchanges as goes astray. Rather than being a place of exchange, they’ve become storage facilities akin to banks.\nMuch like the Frontier Old West, burgeoning with newly developed settlements and towns, exchanges are meant to be way stations: You show up after a long trip, barter for goods, secure your wares on the back of your horse, and trot on. You don’t even think about storing goods on-site.\nThere is an inherent risk in leaving your items with the shopkeeper. There is ample opportunity for fraud (promising inventory that doesn’t exist), theft (taking them outright), or seizure (the local sheriff or outlaw wants his cut). Even if you bring your goods and assets to the bank teller for a deposit, there’s no telling when the next Jesse James bandit will stick up the joint with double pistols.\nJust like the Lone Ranger, it’s best to load up at the way station, pack up securely, and head out.\n\nBitcoin + crypto exchanges are frontier way stations. You show up, barter, then secure your wares on the back of your horse and trot forward. Storing goods on-site is risky: fraud, theft, or seizure Best to load up, pack up + head out. Self-custody. pic.twitter.com/2PxWKugrof\nWhile many of us live this mantra in Bitcoin and use either peer-to-peer or self-custody-promoting exchanges, the majority don’t. And when the Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital, or FTXes of the world run out of other people’s money, have their fraud discovered, or face a bank run, doting customers who trusted the shopkeeper or bank teller are left holding the bag.\nThat is why self-custody is a vital lesson that many of us, humbly, have had to learn at great cost. Many of you likely have stories of lost Bitcoin or are getting mailed bankruptcy claims from some failed crypto yield firm at this very moment. But it doesn’t have to be this way.\nSome Bitcoin-only exchanges, such as Swan or 21 Bitcoin, educate and promote withdrawing immediately to a wallet you control. Others like Bull Bitcoin, Coinfinity, Relai or any of the private options I’ve mentioned elsewhere, don’t even allow you to leave your coins with a custodian.\nTo their credit, exchanges like Coinbase and Binance offer standalone, non-custodial wallets with exportable private keys, but the incentives to use them (especially if you want to play casino games) are minimal.\nIn my mind, this analogy makes clear not only why Bitcoin is different than a Euro or Dollar note, but also why the protocol depends on promoting self-custody and sovereign saving.\nTrust has a place and a time, but Bitcoin remains trustless. Let’s hope you can be too.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2022-12-29T23:57:29-05:00","tag":"Legal","author":"Yael Ossowski"},

This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the case, examining the allegations against the founders and the implications of their arrest.\nThe United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has brought forth serious allegations against Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill, the CEO and CTO of Samourai Wallet, respectively. According to DOJ reports, the duo is accused of orchestrating a “cryptocurrency mixer” that facilitated over $2 billion in unlawful transactions and laundered more than $100 million in criminal proceeds from illegal dark web markets such as Silk Road and Hydra Market.\nThe DOJ press release said:\n“These charges arise from the defendants’ development, marketing, and operation of a cryptocurrency mixer that executed over $2 billion in unlawful transactions and facilitated more than $100 million in money laundering transactions from illegal dark web markets, such as Silk Road and Hydra Market; a web-server intrusion; a spearphishing scheme; and schemes to defraud multiple decentralized finance protocols.”\nAccording to DOJ, Rodriguez and Hill “encouraged and openly invited users to launder criminal proceeds.”\nJames Smith, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI, declared:\n“[Samourai wallet] provided criminals a virtual haven for the clandestine exchange of illicit funds, the facilitation of more than $2 billion in illegal transactions, and $100 million in dark web money laundering. The FBI is committed to exposing covert financial schemes and ensuring no one can hide behind a screen to perpetuate financial wrongdoing.”\nOne private message credited to Hill mentioned: “At Samourai we are entirely focused on the censorship resistance and black/grey circular economy […] This implies no foreseeable mass adoption, although black/grey markets have already started to expand during covid and will continue to do so post-covid…”\nRodriguez and Hill each face charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\nRodriguez was arrested in Pennsylvania, while Hill was apprehended in Portugal. The United States is seeking Hill’s extradition to stand trial. The coordinated arrests demonstrate the international scope of the investigation into Samourai Wallet’s activities.\nIn conjunction with law enforcement authorities in Iceland, the servers and domain of Samourai Wallet were seized. Additionally, a warrant was served to halt downloads of the company’s app from the Google Play Store. These actions signify a concerted effort to disrupt the operations of the bitcoin mixer.\nThe arrests of Rodriguez and Hill are part of a broader crackdown by U.S. authorities on bitcoin mixing services. These services, while purportedly offering privacy-enhancing features, have increasingly come under scrutiny for their potential use in facilitating illegal activities such as money laundering.\nSpeaking on the case, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams emphasized the scale of Samourai Wallet’s alleged criminal activities, stating that it served as a “haven for criminals to engage in large-scale money laundering.” IRS-CI Special Agent Thomas Fattorusso echoed these sentiments, highlighting the lack of oversight in transactions processed by unlicensed money transmitters.\nThe arrests have elicited mixed reactions from the digital assets community. While some have condemned the alleged criminal activities associated with Samourai Wallet, others have expressed concerns about the broader implications for privacy-enhancing technologies in the Bitcoin space.\nKi Young Ju, founder of CryptoQuant, criticized the arrest of Samourai wallet founders, suggesting it targeted the wrong individuals instead of actual criminals. He said:\n“The U.S. DOJ has arrested pioneers in #Bitcoin privacy technology. Privacy stands as a core value of Bitcoin. Mixing itself is not a crime. Even crypto exchanges use mixing to safeguard user privacy. It’s like punishing the inventor of the knife instead of the one who uses it.”\nStacks Co-founder Muneeb Ali echoed Buterin’s position on the legal troubles of Samourai Wallet founders, underscoring the need for clarity. He expressed: “Privacy should be normal, not illegal.”\nYan Pritzker from Swan Bitcoin had mixed feelings about Samourai Wallet. He supported their privacy features but criticized them for provoking the U.S. Department of Justice. He noted:\n“Samourai were trying to do the right thing to provide privacy tech for many legitimate people. Criminal use is a small fraction of mixing use. The merchant where you spend your Bitcoin shouldn’t know how much Bitcoin you own […] But they were wrong to go around promoting a service to criminals, and the design using a centralized coordinator run by a company was an obvious SPOF and was predictably attacked after they kept poking the bear.”\nThe case against Samourai Wallet founders mirrors similar actions taken by U.S. authorities against other digital asset mixing services. For example, Tornado Cash, another popular mixer, saw its founders arrested following sanctions from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\nThe crackdown on Samourai Wallet and other digital asset mixers underscores the growing regulatory scrutiny facing the Bitcoin industry. As governments around the world ramp up efforts to combat money laundering and illicit finance, the future of privacy-enhancing technologies in the sector remains uncertain.\nThe arrest of Samourai Wallet founders represents a significant development in the ongoing battle between law enforcement and digital asset platforms. While the case highlights the challenges posed by anonymity-focused services in combating financial crime, it also raises important questions about the balance between privacy and regulation in the digital age. As the legal proceedings unfold, the Bitcoin community will be closely watching to see how this case shapes the future of mixing services.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"04/26/2024","tag":"Government","author":"Alex Lari"},

Recent reports suggest a shift in the China Bitcoin perception, indicating that the digital asset may soon be officially recognized as property in the country.\nThe latest development in this evolving narrative took place during a seminar hosted by the Nanjing People’s Procuratorate. The focus of the seminar was to assess whether Bitcoin qualifies as property and can thus be subject to laws governing property crimes.\nThe consensus reached was that Bitcoin does possess value and should be regarded as property. This conclusion marks a significant departure from previous stances and sets the stage for Bitcoin’s potential recognition within China’s legal framework.\nThis shift could have profound implications not only for the Bitcoin market but also for global financial dynamics. China’s relationship with Bitcoin has been tumultuous, marked by bans and crackdowns. However, contrary to popular belief, the ban has not been absolute.\nBitcoin has maintained a presence in the country despite regulatory challenges. Moreover, China has been actively engaged in exploring blockchain technology, as evidenced by initiatives such as the digital yuan and plans for Web3 development.\nRichard Byworth, Managing Partner at SyzCapital, hinted at this potential breakthrough, stating:\n“There is talk that the ETF could be added to stock connect. The implications for this are absolutely enormous (basically means mainland money can buy it).”\nByworth’s remarks allude to the possibility of Bitcoin ETFs listed in Hong Kong becoming accessible to mainland Chinese investors, indicating a shift towards greater openness to digital assets.\nBrian HoonJong Paik, Co-founder & COO at SmashFi, echoed Byworth’s sentiments, emphasizing the need for alternative investment opportunities in China.\nPaik highlighted that a significant portion of Chinese wealth is tied up in real estate, suggesting that Bitcoin could serve as a means to diversify investment portfolios and stabilize the socio-economic landscape. He remarked:\n“It’s just a matter of time. 70% of Chinese wealth is in real estate and there are now 100 million empty homes. The CCP needs an alternative asset to mitigate social unrest.”\nHe also highlighted how certain mechanisms in the Hong Kong stock market make it highly accessible for Chinese investors, thereby fostering financial integration between Mainland China and Hong Kong.\nExcluding only the Bitcoin ETFs from this accessibility could lead to significant consequences for institutional and retail investors in both China and Hong Kong.\nThis potential accessibility of Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong to mainland Chinese investors has sparked rumors and speculation.\nWhile the details remain uncertain, the prospect of integrating these ETFs into the Stock Connect system represents a significant step towards financial integration between Hong Kong and mainland China.\nThis move could unlock a massive wave of capital inflow into digital asset funds and bolster Bitcoin’s position in the Asian market.\nColin Wu summarized the consensus reached at the Nanjing seminar, noting that Bitcoin is “not completely banned,” can be traded, and has economic value. This acknowledgment paves the way for Bitcoin to be formally recognized within China’s legal framework, providing clarity and legitimacy to its status.\nHe stated:\n“Chinese scholars generally agree on the property attributes of Bitcoin and summarize: Bitcoin and digital currency has a relatively small space for legal order in China, but it is not completely banned.\nIt is not a contraband. In fact, it can be traded and has economic value, so it can be recognized as property.”\nThe implications of China’s evolving stance on Bitcoin extend beyond its borders. With China being a significant player in the global economy, its recognition of Bitcoin as property could reshape the Bitcoin market and investor sentiment worldwide.\nThe potential lifting of restrictions and the emergence of new investment avenues, such as Bitcoin ETFs, could drive greater adoption and investment in digital assets.\nWhile the Nanjing seminar represents a significant milestone, the discussion on how Bitcoin should be regulated in China is far from over.\nDetermining the valuation of Bitcoin and establishing regulatory frameworks to protect investors are among the key challenges that lie ahead. However, the seminar marks a crucial step towards legitimizing Bitcoin within China and integrating it into the country’s legal and financial systems.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/07/2024","tag":"Asset Protection","author":"Alex Lari"},

Cash has largely disappeared from everyday life. Anyone caught with any form of paper money is considered suspicious. Drugs? Money laundering? Sabotage? Cash is dirty. The currency is digital now. But: Our digital payment transactions have long been fully monitored. This has given economists and central bankers completely new possibilities. As well as the police.\nAfter the European blackout of 2035, the EU rolled out the digital euro at lightning speed. Sure, at first glance, it’s counterintuitive to respond to a blackout by introducing a digital currency. Cash was king in the blackout, after all. But when every European was offered €500 in “crisis bonus” fresh from the European Central Bank‘s digital money press, doubts quickly evaporated. After a few days, hundreds of millions had a digital account directly with the ECB.\nThere were many teething problems. But 15 years later, the digital euro is a completely normal thing that is not questioned. Bitcoin still dominates the black market today. And it is rumored that the rich and powerful have long used digital accounts on the blockchain to circumvent their own rules. But these are just rumors. The masses don’t have time for illegal currencies. They have to go to work and pay taxes. And play by the rules. Otherwise life will quickly become expensive.\nIndividual tax rates have long been set according to consumption patterns. This is what the “global agreement on establishing fairness and ecology in the tax system,” the GLOBFAIR, introduced. Since it was adopted in 2034, there are no more loopholes. Of course, the promise to finally counter climate change this way was not kept. But the system has remained regardless. Shopping behavior, social media, the workplace: those who behave the “right” way are rewarded. Those who don’t are punished. The only problem is that the definition of what is right — and what is wrong — is different everywhere.\nChina has led the way. When the digital yuan was presented to the world in 2022, people in Europe and the USA were still relaxed. But when the Chinese diaspora began to use the app with Mao’s face in the West, central bankers in Washington and Frankfurt became nervous. Digital plans for the dollar and euro were brought forward. Central bankers and politicians traveled to Beijing for inspiration. The new technical possibilities were too tempting. It was the end of anonymity. A new age of electronic surveillance dawned.\nAn unrealistic scenario? A polemical exaggeration? Hopefully. But unfortunately not necessarily. It is well known that China wants to introduce its digital yuan as early as 2022 — at the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The giant communist empire also makes no secret of the fact that digital money is to be part of its surveillance state. Anyone who uses cash already makes himself suspicious. And anyone who buys the wrong thing electronically or otherwise attracts attention in a way that displeases the regime will end up on the blacklist. In the Western media, this is called a “social credit score.”\nIt sounds harmless, but it’s not. China monitors its citizens at every turn. Not only payment transactions are screened and evaluated, but also behavior on social media and elsewhere on the Internet. Private chats? Not a chance. In China, you never know whether a message has been received. Anyone who uses the wrong terms is automatically deleted. The digital yuan closes one of the last loopholes: Cash — and the use of “private” apps like “We Chat Pay” and “Alipay.” The market has made China great. It has done its duty now. It can go.\nThe digital yuan is a tool that would have suited the secret service of the former communist East of Germany just fine. It is a surveillance currency. Your account is with the Stasi.\nThere is also no escape. The Internet is under control, protected by the “great firewall.” Bitcoin miners have been thrown out of the country, crypto exchanges have been closed. Tech founders like Jack Ma have had their influence severely curtailed by the regime. Xi Jingping probably wants to establish himself as ruler for life. He is tightening the reins everywhere and centralizing power in Beijing.\nAnd it is there, of all places, that the German Bundesbank is drawing inspiration for its European plans for a digital currency. This is what happened in September 2021 at a Zoom conference among central bankers. “E-yuan and digital euro: Germany wants to learn from China,” reported the Frankfurter Allgemeine. What exactly can be learned from an undemocratic system of total surveillance, however, is not specifically spelled out in the article.\nBut still. Jens Weidmann, then head of the Bundesbank, lays it down: the digital euro will “not be a jack of all trades.” What does he mean by that? Weidmann cleverly reveals the dirty little secret: “A digital euro would not be as anonymous as cash.” Yes, privacy would have to be preserved. Somehow. By lip service. But if the worst came to the worst, the authorities would already have access. On suspicion. That cannot be prevented.\nWeidmann is thus putting his finger directly in the wound. The ECB has already conducted a survey among Europeans and found that by far the most important thing to people in Europe is the protection of their privacy. In Germany, Austria, and southern Europe in particular, cash is still the most popular way to pay for purchases. The pandemic has weakened that, but it hasn’t changed it.\nAnd that’s how “central bank digital currency” is being marketed. In short: CBDC, which already sounds like a secret service. The new money is to replace cash in the digital age. That is the central bankers’ first goal. The others are: Defense against foreign digital currencies (yuan, dollar); restriction of private payment service providers (Visa, Mastercard, Apple, PayPal); defense against bitcoin and prevention of all plans for private money from the hands of powerful corporations (Facebook, Amazon).\nIn addition, they want to go search of suspicious payment movements: Money laundering, terror, mafia. They want to design the system in such a way that the private banking sector is also happy. They also want to try out new economic concepts. Negative interest rates on private accounts? Unconditional basic income? Money with an expiration date? Controlling consumption? There would be hardly any limits to the economists’ ideas.\nBut there are so many questions: Who has to agree? The EU Commission? The national parliaments? Do we even need to change the EU treaties? Referendums?\nEverything depends on how the “digital euro” is designed in detail. There are hardly any answers yet. Only a rough timeline. In 2023, we should see a prototype. There will be no need for a blockchain like the one used by Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the decentralized alternative to beat — with the full power of the law and the central server architecture of the ECB. The digital euro will most likely be modeled after a European real-time payment system that already exists: TIPS. Target Instant Payment System.\nAnd yes, apart from all the horror scenarios and surveillance fears: The digital Euro has to solve a concrete, real problem. It’s true that our money is already often digital in everyday life — but only cash is “central bank money” and only “central bank money” is also legal tender. So what would distinguish a digital euro from today’s? The signs with “cash only” would finally disappear from Vienna’s coffeehouses. Because the digital euro must be accepted.\nWhat’s the point of all this if cash does exist? The ECB also firmly maintains that it does not want to abolish cash. It has just started the redesign of the euro banknotes. But the trend toward digital payment will be unstoppable. What is needed today are preparations for Day X, when not the state but the market and its participants decide by a majority that they no longer want to rely on paper money and coins. Then the central bank must offer an alternative for its central product. Otherwise, it would not be doing its job.\nThe issue of privacy can also be viewed in a differentiated way: Haven’t we long since been revealing ourselves to the U.S. tech giants on a daily basis? Don’t Visa, Mastercard, Google, and Apple know everything anyway? Yes, but — at least in theory — they still form a wall against the authorities. And we do it voluntarily.\nSo there needs to be a digital equivalent to cash. But without privacy. Agustín Carstens, the head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has already explained it in a video that caused a furor on the internet: Digital central bank money will “not be like cash,” Carstens said. Because the central bank will have “absolute control” over what happens to the money. Not very reassuring.\nVideo clips relating to CBDCs. 🧵 BIS' Agustín Carstens: with CBDCs \"central banks will have absolute control\". https://t.co/DWlyFcVjOH pic.twitter.com/dXBZ3oiJEC\nAnd Carstens is not just anyone. The BIS is a powerful financial organization that hardly anyone knows about. A sort of think tank for central banks, where thoughts about the future are spun. Founded after World War I to handle the payment of Germany’s war debts, the BIS has been adept at finding new tasks and staying relevant. Now it deals less with gold and more with computers.\nBut even once the exact design of the degree of surveillance in the digital euro has been clarified, things are not yet in the clear. We are rattling along at top speed into a world with competition between currencies and payment systems.\nSo it’s understandable if the ECB wants to protect its product, the euro, from the yuan, dollar, and bitcoin. But how will it ensure that the digital euro only reaches Europeans? Or do they want to engage in a global showdown anyway and also offer it to users in North or South America? The euro also thrives on its role as an international currency. Especially in unstable countries around the EU, it plays a role for the population — as cash. And with Montenegro, at least one country that is not even in the EU has introduced the euro as its national currency. Will the Montenegrins have access to the digital euro? It is unclear.\nBitcoin is the next problem. The cryptocurrency was created by its mysterious inventor Satoshi Nakamoto expressly to prevent a horror scenario like the one described at the beginning. To “carve out a piece of freedom” for the people. Bitcoin is already much closer to a true digital cash substitute than digital central bank currencies will ever be. It has established itself as a national currency in countries like El Salvador and at least as an investment asset in the wealthy West.\nMillions are using bitcoin. Billions flow into it. And it’s built to withstand attacks and bans. Governments will not be able to stop Bitcoin — rather, the digitization of currencies will fuel its development. Only China has a chance to help itself with sheer force and electronic walls. But the democracies of the West are not in a position to do that.\nAnd the banks? They are by no means happy. If everyone can get an account at the ECB, why do they need one at Raiffeisen or Santander? What role do commercial banks play in this new world? What about negative interest rates? If every European maintains his or her own account with the ECB, digital bank runs could occur within minutes, with people pulling their money out of a bank in a panic — because they heard news or rumors about the bank’s stability.\nTo prevent this, the ECB is considering a cap of 3,000 euros per account for the digital euro. Any holdings of digital euros above that would automatically be transferred to the current account. But again, an answer is followed by three questions: Will this cap be adjusted for inflation? Will corporate customers get higher limits? And what about in the event of a crisis, when a bank really falters and customers quite rightly want to flee under the protective umbrella of the central bank?\nA well-designed digital euro could give Europe a competitive edge in the global market. After all, the ECB is considered the most “independent” of central banks since it is not answerable to just one state. Will that be enough to create trust among users? Or will they not care in the end, because digital money is needed in a digital world?\nWashington does not yet have any answers to this question either. Unlike China and Europe, however, the issuers of the world currency apparently see little urgency. Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, said that they are still examining the issue. Of course, the U.S. is also a leading nation in the digital world, and there will certainly be something like the digital dollar. But it is not yet clear whether this will have to come from the central bank at all. The U.S. has the deepest capital markets and, unlike China, is not afraid of capital flight. And they are observing an interesting process around Bitcoin.\nIn the crypto world, there are de facto two reserve currencies: Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency. And the dollar — in the form of so-called “stablecoins.” These are digital currencies that are pegged to the “real” dollar. These are issued by private companies — and they are enjoying tremendous popularity. Suddenly, billions of people in countries with poor, inflation-ridden currencies have access to dollars at lightning speed. Users don’t care much that they are derivatives. Thus, the new world of blockchain is helping to establish the dollar as a reserve currency among a whole new generation of private users. What if such dollar coins are issued by banks to make them available to companies as well? Will the digital dollar end up coming not from the central bank at all but from the private sector?\nAt the start of 2022, there are still many more unanswered questions than there are answers when it comes to digital currencies. We only know four things: digitization cannot be stopped. This also affects our currencies. China is much further ahead than the West when it comes to digital money. But Beijing must not serve as a role model — but as a cautionary example.\nThis article was translated from German — and slightly adapted/edited.

Bitcoin’s transformative impact on the financial landscape has sparked debates about its genesis. Saylor’s insights help demystify this enigma and decode the significance of bitcoin’s creation.\n💥A scientific marvel like fire and heliocentrism, found through exploration and experimentation. Join Michael Saylor in a profound conversation as he explores new perspectives on whether Bitcoin is an invention or a discovery 👇#InventionOrDiscoveryhttps://t.co/Lflzkw38ih\nBitcoin represents an unprecedented decentralized digital commodity network, challenging conventional notions of currency. Saylor emphasizes that bitcoin’s genesis is a remarkable fusion of invention and discovery, setting it apart in the financial world.\nBitcoin’s design as a decentralized network with no central issuer is a groundbreaking invention. Its viral, cybernetic, and stabilizing character differentiates it from other digital commodities. Crucially, bitcoin’s inflation-resistant model, capped at 21 million coins, distinguishes it from alternatives like dogecoin.\nBitcoin’s journey from being valueless to a valuable asset is a significant discovery. Its emergence as a scarcity network without monetary value for a year and a half represents an unparalleled phenomenon in human history. This unique evolution highlights bitcoin’s distinctiveness.\nConsidering the alternative scenarios, had dogecoin or another cryptocurrency taken the lead, bitcoin’s narrative would have been dramatically different. Its zero-inflation model and indefinite half-life contribute to its exceptional story, contrasting with inflationary counterparts.\nSaylor likens bitcoin’s creation to building ships. Bitcoin, like a sturdy steel vessel, stands out among digital commodities, while others resemble decaying wooden ships. The durability of bitcoin’s design distinguishes it from its peers.\nBitcoin’s creation is the result of a collaborative effort by visionary engineers like David Chaum, Adam Back, Hal Finney, and the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. They brought together diverse concepts, laying the foundation for bitcoin’s transformative system.\nBitcoin’s discovery of absolute scarcity sets it apart from other digital commodity networks, suggesting it could surpass nations and potentially endure beyond humanity. This positions bitcoin as a significant milestone in human history.\nBitcoin’s engineering and discovery have reshaped the digital asset and finance landscape. Saylor’s insights shed light on bitcoin’s genesis as a fusion of invention and discovery. As we continue to comprehend the significance of bitcoin its profound impact on finance and technology is poised to transcend generations.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-09-20T18:04:24-04:00","tag":"Technology","author":"Alex Lari"},

Despite this notion, his recent statements indicate that he supports Vanguard’s current stance on Bitcoin.\nIn an interview, Ramji reiterated Vanguard’s commitment to consistency and its investment philosophy, which currently excludes offering Bitcoin-related products to its clients.\n“I think it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer,” Ramji stated in an interview with Barron’s.\nHe emphasized:\n“I have heard [CIO] Greg Davis’ explanation and I think it is entirely consistent with Vanguard’s investment philosophy. It is a logical and consistent point of view.”\nThe decision not to offer Bitcoin ETFs has been a topic of discussion, especially considering the growing popularity of Bitcoin. While competitors like BlackRock and Fidelity have embraced Bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard, with its $8.6 trillion in assets under management, has taken a different approach.\nNeil Jacobs, Co-Founder at FOMO21Shop, criticized Vanguard’s policies while praising Fidelity’s, stating:\n“Fidelity is LIGHT YEARS ahead of Vanguard. They’re calling existing customers already exposed to bitcoin-related securities […] to address any questions about the Bitcoin ETFs. That is how you treat customers.”\nRamji stated that Vanguard believes digital assets are speculative and immature assets that do not align with their core principles of long-term, low-cost investing.\nRamji’s assertions further strengthen analysts’ perception that a significant shift in the company’s approach to Bitcoin is unlikely.\nRelated: The Vanguard Bitcoin ETF Refusal: Why It is A Mistake\nWhile a Vanguard Bitcoin ETF is unlikely, there have been discussions about Vanguard permitting its clients to purchase other spot Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform. While this remains a possibility, Ramji did not address this matter directly in his interview.\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart expressed skepticism about the possibility of Ramji introducing a Vanguard spot Bitcoin ETF, stating that the company’s position is unlikely to change.\nHe added:\n“[…] But I think Salim could reverse Vanguard’s stance on not allowing their clients to buy spot Bitcoin ETFs on their brokerage platform.”\nThe decision not to offer Bitcoin ETFs has not been without its challenges.\nSome Vanguard clients expressed dissatisfaction and threatened to close their accounts when the firm restricted access to spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Despite this backlash, Vanguard remains committed to its investment philosophy.\nWhile Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant growth since their launch, Vanguard continues to view digital assets as speculative investments. Ramji’s appointment apparently does not signal a change in Vanguard’s commitment to its investment philosophy and long-term strategy.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/17/2024","tag":"ETF","author":"Alex Lari"},

It has subsequently recovered, currently at 586 EH/s.\nThis decline in hashrate is attributed to miners turning off unprofitable rigs according to James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares. This adjustment comes as a response to reduced rewards of Bitcoin mining resulting from the halving, coupled with rising electricity costs.\nThe reduction in hash rate was anticipated, with CoinShares predicting a temporary drop but also expecting the hashrate to surge in the coming years.\nThe report states:\n“Our model forecasts the hashrate rising to 700 exahash by 2025, although after the halving, it could fall by up to 10% as miners turn off unprofitable ASICs.”\nNazar Khan, the co-founder and COO of TeraWulf, emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency in navigating these challenges. He states:\n“If you are a firm that just owns a bunch of machines and you are not profitable, you will be challenged. If you are a company that owns quality infrastructure that can deliver low-cost power, that’s a real asset.”\nTeraWulf, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining companies, worth over $670 million, plans to expand its operations despite the reduction in block rewards.\nGiven the profitability of mining operations depends heavily on the cost of electricity, older ASIC models such as the S19 XP and M50S++ now operate at a loss when electricity costs exceed certain thresholds. A Hashrate index report notes that even newer models like the S19j Pro+ and M30S++ face challenges with rising electricity costs.\nAmidst these challenges, Bitcoin miners are also facing fluctuations in mining difficulty. There has recently been a notable 6% decline in Bitcoin mining difficulty, marking the most substantial drop since the bear market of 2022.\nThis adjustment reflects broader market dynamics post-Bitcoin halving, with higher-cost mining rigs being phased out due to escalating costs and lower bitcoin prices. The reduction in mining difficulty is seen as beneficial for miners with lower operational costs.\nAnalysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra suggest that this adjustment allows lower-cost miners to increase their market share. Companies like Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, known for their low production costs, are expected to benefit from this shift.\nDespite the challenges, analysts do not foresee a significant downturn in bitcoin prices. They predict Bitcoin will remain range-bound in the short term, with the potential for an upward breakout as institutional investors show interest through the next wave of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nThe recent halving event has also introduced selling pressure among Bitcoin miners. Kaiko notes that daily average network fees surged initially but have since declined, potentially leading to selling pressure from miners. This pressure arises as creating new blocks involves substantial electricity costs, which miners cover by liquidating their bitcoin holdings.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/15/2024","tag":"Asics","author":"Alex Lari"},

Pizzino stated:\n“I don’t think the cycle’s over by any stretch of the imagination, so I’m just going to look at the upside targets.”\nHe elaborated that his first significant target is $135,000, a figure derived from projecting the range of bitcoin’s previous move from $3,000 to $68,000, which totals around $65,000, onto the current price level.\nCurrently, bitcoin is trading around $67,300, reflecting an impressive 11% increase over the last seven days.\nHowever, trading volume has decreased by 21%, now standing at around $24.6 billion. Despite the dip in volume, the overall market sentiment remains bullish. Pizzino remains confident that bitcoin will surpass its current resistance and continue to climb. The analyst notes:\n“Obviously, $100,000 is going to be a number that everyone’s going to be looking at, a bit of a psychological level. Probably big parties going on there ‘Bitcoin to $100,000,’ all that sort of jazz.”\nPizzino also mentioned other intermediate targets between $115,000 and $120,000, while expressing particular interest in the range of $130,000 to $150,000. He is keen to observe how bitcoin behaves if it reaches these price points, especially in terms of potential rallies and corrections.\n“Maybe we start to get this price cluster coming together higher up on the price chart around $150,000.” he added.\nAs the market watches closely, the coming weeks could prove pivotal in determining whether bitcoin will achieve Pizzino’s ambitious prediction and set new records.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"05/19/2024","tag":"Analysis","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

Peel stated:\n“We see Bitcoin ETFs as an essential component of diversified portfolios, offering exposure to the potential growth of digital assets.”\nThe firm’s investment joins the ranks of other major financial institutions, including JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, and Canada’s Bank of Montreal, which have also disclosed investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs.\nMillennium Management, a management company overseeing assets worth over $64 billion, also made a substantial move by investing an extraordinary ~$2 billion across several Bitcoin ETFs, marking one of the largest investments seen in recent weeks.\nAs more traditional financial institutions warm up to Bitcoin, accessible ETFs have enabled them to dip their toes into the Bitcoin market, further fueling its adoption. Many analysts believe that this is just the beginning, and institutions are just testing the waters, predicting larger investments in the future.\nDespite initial skepticism from some firms like Vanguard, the broader shift has been towards embracing Bitcoin exposure, driven by robust client demand for access to Bitcoin’s future growth prospects.\nA spokesperson from Morgan Stanley commented:\n“Our clients are increasingly seeking exposure to digital assets like Bitcoin as part of their investment strategies. We believe that Bitcoin ETFs provide an efficient and regulated way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market.”\nThe recent wave of filings from institutional investors highlights a historical scale of professional investor ownership in Bitcoin markets.

I can’t pretend to be informed on this subject, despite being a lot more so now than I was a week ago – like most of us, I guess.\nWe covered so many subjects. The incredible bravery of the Ukrainian people and the resilience they have shown in the face of much better-armed opponents; the apparent strategic mistakes made by Russian forces so far, and the poor communication; the ruthlessness of Putin, the need to win and the risk that he doubles down.\nWe also covered sanctions, Swift and the weaponisation of money; the war on the oligarchs and the kleptocrats; the imminent refugee crisis; propaganda; the tacit alliance between Russia and China – and that China will be watching all of this and learning; the ramifications for Taiwan; the dependency of so many nations on Ukraine and Russia for food supplies. And much more besides.\nI watched, listened and tried to learn.\nI left the studio with a distinct feeling of dread that this invasion may prove to be the beginning of something much bigger. Russian commentator Konstantin Kisin, who hosts the popular podcast Triggerpod, kept repeating the point that in terms of historic significance this invasion is “bigger than 9-11”. The geopolitical landscape has changed, he said, and the West is at war.\nOn both days, I left the studio feeling glad that I owned gold. It has been a source of immense disappointment and frustration to me, as regular readers will know, but there is a time to own gold and now would appear to be one of those times.\nI have reported more times than I care to remember on the vast amounts both Russia and China have accumulated over the last 20 years.\nMeanwhile, the way that the West has weaponised its money and banking against Russia is extraordinary – unprecedented even, and made possible by digital banking and modern technology.\nChina is surely looking at this weaponisation, looking at Taiwan, and thinking that to protect itself, it needs to de-dollarise as quickly and discreetly as possible. Indeed, we know China has already been doing that.\nWith so much money frozen abroad, one of the few ways in which Russia can actually fund itself is by selling its gold, probably via Dubai, so that may mean selling pressure. Even so, I think gold rises from here.\nInflation comes with war; money gets debased, no matter which side you are on. If there is some kind of China-Russia, anti-West alliance, then just as we have retaliated against Russia through Swift and the banking system, that alliance will do the same in reverse. Ergo, it will wage war on the dollar.\nWestern money is vulnerable. Fiat money has been printed into oblivion, while interest rates have been suppressed. Official inflation is already at 7%, while actual inflation is arguably much higher. Yet the system probably can’t take interest rates much above two or three percent. There is too much debt.\nWhen the price of raw materials – commodities and natural resources – goes up even more because a key supplier, Russia, has been cut off, the pain of inflation is going to get worse.\nGovernments may well attempt to impose price controls, but history shows that any relief that comes from price controls is only temporary. For the most part they don’t work and often just lead to shortages.\nI’ve said for many years all China has to do is declare what its gold holdings really are – and you can see last year’s estimates here (I will do an update on this soon) – and that will be tantamount to a declaration of war. My theory, remember, is that China’s gold holdings are as big, if not bigger than those of the US.\nI know I have long moaned about gold. It’s the most analogue asset there is in a world where all the value is digital. But I have also said many times that I continue to own it. It may be analogue but it has also been money since forever. It’s the first metal we ever used.\nWe used it long before the Bronze Age, when we discovered smelting. Its purpose was the same as it is now – as reward, as display, as store of value, as tool of trade (in this case barter). In other words, as money.\nBut I have moaned about it because it has been such a perennial disappointment for so long.\nThe currency wars are hotting up. Attacks on national currencies are going to become the norm; the rouble has been bombed already. Don’t think that at some stage the dollar, euro and the pound are not going to come under attack, because they will. Other fiat currencies will get caught in the crossfire.\nGold and bitcoin are the places to hide.\nOn the subject of bitcoin, I see this conflict as an opportunity for it to decouple itself from the Nasdaq. If Swift is out of bounds, and governments in conflict have their tentacles running through the banking system, the use case for bitcoin suddenly got more compelling. What better way to transfer value across borders?\nYou want to own both. And all those gold miners located far away from all of this in the Americas. There’s going to be a lot more demand for their product.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-11-05T00:10:22-04:00","tag":"Learn","author":"Bitcoin News"},

Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., led by CEO Fred Thiel, offers a unique perspective on this matter. Thiel suggests that the effects of the halving may already be priced into the market due to various factors, including the recent surge in bitcoin’s value and the approval of spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).\nThe Bitcoin halving, an event programmed into the Bitcoin’s protocol, occurs approximately every four years. During this event, the reward for Bitcoin miners is halved, reducing the rate at which new bitcoin are generated. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been associated with bullish market sentiment and price rallies.\nAccording to Thiel, the recent surge in bitcoin’s value and the approval of spot ETFs have accelerated the market’s response to the halving. He states in an interview with Bloomberg on April 9:\n“I think the ETF approval, which has been a huge success, has attracted capital into the market and essentially brought forward what could have been the price appreciation we typically would have seen three to six months post halving, So I think we are seeing part of that now already and that has put forward some of the demand.”\nWhile Thiel remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, others, like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, predict price fluctuations before and after the halving. Thiel, however, sees the halving as an opportunity for growth rather than a cause for concern.\nThe CEO of Marathon, the largest Bitcoin mining company, said that the market may have anticipated the Bitcoin halving to a certain extent. After the halving, this mining company can maintain profitability at $46,000 per Bitcoin. https://t.co/lqJO6oal6b\nThiel described how the halving event would diminish the daily supply of bitcoin by approximately 450 units, “which would have some small impact on prices probably.” He expressed satisfaction with the pre-halving rally as it goes against past market trends, particularly as a mining company. He added:\n“But as miners we are very excited to go into a halving, where for once prices have not declined prior to the halving rather prices have gone up so everybody is obviously maximizing to that.”\nThiel’s perspective is further supported by CryptoQuant, an analytics firm, which suggests that the halving’s influence on price may be less dramatic than anticipated. While the halving reduces the supply of newly minted bitcoin, increased selling from long-term holders may offset this decrease in supply.\n$BTC demand growth seems to be a major driver of higher prices post-halving. In past cycles, #Bitcoin demand growth from large holders/whales (violet area) has spiked, fueling the price rally. Currently, demand growth is around the highest ever (11% MoM). pic.twitter.com/PefL54jPlC\nMichael Jerlis, CEO and founder of EMCD Mining Pool, likens the market’s response to a rollercoaster ride, with prices soaring and dipping before and after the halving event. He expressed, “it’s like riding a rollercoaster: prices soar, they dip, and everyone’s eyes turn to altcoins for a thrill.” Despite varying opinions, there is consensus that the halving will have significant implications for the broader digital asset market.\nBitcoin mining specialist Jaran Mellerud forecasted a minor drop in the hash rate post-halving. He expects a bull market afterward, driven mainly by increasing demand rather than reduced supply. He mentioned:\n“however, the growing demand, and not the meager supply decline, will be the main factor fueling the price surge.”\nThe #Bitcoin hashrate will likely not drop as much following the halving. Only by 5-10%, as per @penny_ether's predictions. Also, historically, it took 57 days on average for the hashrate to return to pre-halving levels, so it will likely quickly re-bounce. pic.twitter.com/Jgx6jfj6L5\nOliver Isaacs, an investor and analyst, highlighted that the amount of bitcoin available on exchanges reached its lowest level in six years. Additionally, multiple countries are gearing up to authorize Bitcoin ETPs.\nNotably, Bitfinex anticipated that following the halving event, a surge in market activity would drive bitcoin’s value to reach $150,000.\nAs the Bitcoin halving event draws nearer, Fred Thiel’s perspective offers valuable insights into the market dynamics surrounding this significant event. While some anticipate a bullish rally, Thiel suggests that the effects of the halving may already be priced into the market, thanks to recent developments such as the approval of spot ETFs. As investors and market participants await the outcome, the market remains poised for potential shifts in price and sentiment.\nThiel’s perspective sheds light on the complex interplay of factors influencing bitcoin’s price trajectory, highlighting the importance of understanding market dynamics in navigating this volatile landscape.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-04-11T12:33:52-04:00","tag":"Mining","author":"Alex Lari"},

Therefore, the Article 90 Commission insists on the need for the Central Bank to provide legal documentation in this regard while halting the current process.\nAccording to him, regarding the digital currency project, the Parliament should express its opinion in the form of a proposal or draft, and argue whether CBDC is a necessity for the country at the moment, considering the existing economic conditions.\nIran has been dealing with U.S. sanctions for decades, and it has had big impacts on its economy.

This institution initiated a pilot project for this digital currency with the issuance of one billion Rials in September of last year.\nMany are against the Central Bank’s digital Rial project, and they believe that this project contradicts the interests of the general public, considering Articles 8 and 9 of the Constitution.\nCritics express concerns over the project, saying this will grant the central bank unrestricted control over individuals’ assets.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-07-20T14:45:20-04:00","tag":"Regulation","author":"Alex Lari"},

It states:\n“Iran, Russia, and North Korea—which has emerged as one of the world’s most prolific crypto-criminals, stealing $1.7 billion in digital assets in 2022 alone—have turned to digital assets to evade sanctions and fund illegal weapons programs.”\nThe proposed measures in the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act include a comprehensive extension of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) responsibilities. It claims to work on the “same transaction, same risk, same rule” philosophy, imposing strict Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements on all echelons of the digital asset sector, from miners to wallet providers.\nJUST IN: Elizabeth Warren introduces The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023 👀 This bill would extend Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) responsibilities, including KYC requirements for all digital asset wallet providers, miners, and validators 😮 pic.twitter.com/fAifdII5L6\nIn particular, the legislation focuses on “unhosted” digital wallets, which allow users to bypass AML and sanctions checks. The Act directs the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to finalize and implement its December 2020 proposed rule. This rule requires banks and money service businesses to verify customer and counterparty identities for transactions involving unhosted wallets or wallets hosted in non-BSA-compliant jurisdictions.\nThe proposed bill also aims to address the anonymity-enhancing technologies used in the digital asset space. It suggests FinCEN should issue guidance to financial institutions on mitigating the risks associated with anonymized digital assets. The document reads:\n“It directs FinCEN to issue guidance to financial institutions on mitigating the risks of handling, using, or transacting with digital assets that have been anonymized using digital asset mixers and other anonymity-enhancing technologies.”\nTo strengthen the enforcement, the Act directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to establish AML/CFT compliance examination and review processes for entities under their regulatory purview.\nRecognizing the global nature of digital assets, the Act extends BSA rules to include the reporting of foreign bank accounts. U.S. citizens engaged in transactions exceeding $10,000 in digital assets through offshore accounts would be required to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\nRelated reading: “Bitcoin Is In Danger In U.S.” — Warns Hedge Fund Manager Paul Tudor\nSenator Warren’s legislative proposal drew a swift and potent response from the Bitcoin community.\nThis elected official is using a bogus news article to push a false narrative and now using this false narrative to pass a bill…..WTF #FireElizabethWarren\nCritics argue that imposing anti-money laundering (AML) regulations on developers and node operators might stifle innovation and compromise privacy.\nUnreal – I wish someone would let me know if Hamas lives in rock caves and underground tunnels or if they are a sophisticated or futuristic society using Crypto and Bitcoin. These people like (Elizabeth) can't have it both ways IMHO\nBalancing security and user privacy is a major concern, with detractors, including legal experts and digital-asset think tanks, warning against the potential erosion of privacy rights in the pursuit of regulatory compliance.\nRelated reading:\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-01-22T04:06:00-05:00","tag":"Regulation","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

The country has reportedly mined ~473 bitcoin since 2021, contributing to its 5,750 bitcoin holding, valued at over $370 million.\nThe official data released by the power plant highlights the government’s commitment to sustainable practices. With 1.5 megawatts (MW) of the plant’s total 102 MW dedicated to Bitcoin mining, El Salvador prioritizes environmental preservation while embracing the Bitcoin revolution.\nBack in 2021, Daniel Álvarez, president of the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Executive Commission overseeing the power plant, emphasized the importance of renewable resources in bitcoin mining, stating:\n“We don’t spend resources that contaminate the environment, we don’t depend on oil, we don’t depend on natural gas, on any resource that isn’t renewable.”\nThe south American country’s geothermal energy strategy for Bitcoin mining is successful due to its 20 active volcanoes, allowing it to harness geothermal power as a clean and sustainable energy source.\nNotably, the nation imports 7.4% of its total energy consumption, while the rest is generated by hydroelectric, geothermal, and fossil fuel-fired power plants.\nAs per the official data, geothermal energy constitutes around 22% of the country’s total energy output.\nDespite the widespread use of fossil fuels in the energy sector, El Salvador aims to use clean geothermal power to reduce its environmental footprint while contributing to the growth of the digital asset industry.\nPresident Bukele’s administration has played an important role in promoting Bitcoin mining in El Salvador, installing 300 operations to mine bitcoin directly from the Tecapa volcano. The President Bukele has also expressed no intention of selling the country’s bitcoin holdings, which now boast an unrealized profit of over $57.4 million.\nEl Salvador has recently launched a website for tracking its bitcoin Treasury, providing transparency and public accountability to its citizens and the community at large by offering real-time updates on the nation’s bitcoin wealth.\nEl Salvador’s move into Bitcoin mining is part of its larger plan for economic development and sustainability.\nThis move is a part of President Nayib Bukele’s ambitious Bitcoin City project announced in 2021, which aims to draw global investment with substantial tax incentives and position El Salvador as a frontrunner in blockchain technology.\nThe country’s pro-Bitcoin stance is evident by its actionable positive response to embrace Bitcoin.

The former US politician articulated a compelling argument, suggesting that Bitcoin could attain a staggering market capitalization of $15 trillion.\nIn the latest episode of Opto – Invest in Innovation, Scaramucci acknowledged the seemingly effective performance of the US Federal Reserve. However, he raised a profound concern about the underlying system upon which the Fed operates, characterizing it as fundamentally flawed.\nHis contention was rooted in the visible devaluation of fiat currencies. The former politician claims that the government consistently spends 43 cents on the dollar more than it generates in revenue.\nScaramucci explained that the current situation is risky because borrowed funds must be repaid with dollars worth more than at the time of borrowing. This, according to him, could lead to a severe economic crisis. Consequently, the Fed finds itself in a precarious position, entangled in a system that is fundamentally broken, he explains.\nTo address this systemic challenge, Scaramucci suggests an alternative solution — a decentralized, immutable asset with inherent scarcity, effectively functioning as a transparent transaction ledger. He underscored that no other asset currently possesses these defining characteristics except for Bitcoin. He envisioned Bitcoin evolving into a store of value that could surpass gold.\nIn a resounding statement, the former U.S. politician predicted that Bitcoin, which is currently valued at around $600 billion, could reach a market capitalization of $15 trillion. Moreover, he acknowledged the obstacles involved in fixing the problem.\nHe elaborated that the problem is repairable, but it demands a long-term, strategic approach. He claimed that American policymakers frequently lack the long-term vision and detailed plans for the future that other countries, like China, exhibit.\nAnthony Scaramucci, renowned for his entrepreneurial ventures and investment expertise, has emerged as a major advocate for the future of Bitcoin. In a separate interview, he disclosed his significant investment in the digital asset space, including holdings of Bitcoin within the SkyBridge portfolio and his personal balance sheet.\nNotably, he emphasized a unique attribute of Bitcoin—its fixed supply, making it resilient to inflation. In his view, Bitcoin is the only asset globally that has a soaring demand without the possibility of increasing its supply. He states:\n“If you have a higher demand for gold, we’ll build more mines. Bitcoin has a finite supply.”\nScaramucci’s belief in Bitcoin’s potential to reshape the financial landscape is a testament to its growing prominence in the world of finance and investment.\nRelated reading:\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-11-09T05:43:34-05:00","tag":"Government","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

They allow different applications to communicate with each other by establishing a set of protocols. However, API monetization can be challenging for businesses.\nWhile companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter provide free public APIs, most businesses want to generate revenue from the APIs they develop. An API represents years of R&D and innovation for a company. It makes its unique data and services available to external developers, so companies naturally want to capitalize on these investments.\nHowever, putting a price tag on API usage is a challenging process. Companies have to strike a balance between monetization and developer adoption. More relaxed monetization models can limit an API’s reach and utilization. On the other hand, they are giving away API access for free, which leaves potential revenue on the table.\nBusinesses must also contend with complex usage metrics like monthly active users, peak loads, and tiered pricing models, which makes determining the right monetization strategy for an API challenging.\nThis article will explain a clever way to monetize APIs with a pay-as-you-go model. This model can reduce user friction, increase revenue, and improve security.\nAPIs have become crucial assets for modern businesses. We are going to breakdown are going to breakdown two main approaches to API monetization:\nDirect monetization means charging developers and end users for API usage. This could involve:\nDirect monetization generates revenue directly from the API itself. But it can be complex to implement and may limit API adoption.\nIndirect monetization does not charge for API usage. Instead, the API is a gateway to monetize other products or services. For example:\nIndirect models allow businesses to unlock more value from their APIs. But measuring the ROI can be difficult. Companies often use a mix of direct and indirect monetization strategies.\nThere are several common ways that companies generate revenue from APIs:\nUsage-based pricing charges API consumers based on how much they use the API. This involves metering API calls and charging per call, per thousand calls, per million calls, etc. Usage charges can be based on the number of requests, bandwidth consumed, number of records accessed, or other metrics. This model allows the monetization of APIs with very granular pricing.\nWith tiered pricing, access to API features is grouped into different packages or tiers. Higher tiers provide greater capabilities, usage allowances, or additional features. For example, a basic tier may allow up to 10,000 API calls per month, while higher tiers allow 100,000 or 500,000 calls for a higher fee. Tiers work well for monetizing access to premium API capabilities.\nDeveloper plans provide packaged access to APIs tailored to different types of developers. For example, plans may differentiate between individual developers, startups and enterprises. Higher-level plans may offer higher usage limits, more support, additional capabilities or other benefits. Developer plans make it easy for different customers to find the right level of API access.\nCompanies can also earn money by offering services in addition to core API access. These value-added services provide additional revenue streams. Examples include premium support plans, custom development services, customized APIs, data enrichment services, API management tools, and training.\nThe L402 protocol provides a clever solution for monetizing APIs by combining the capabilities of macaroons and the Lightning Network.\nL402, formerly LSAT, is an open standard that enables charging for API usage while handling authentication for distributed systems. It brings together the strengths of two key technologies:\nWith L402, macaroons are tied to Lightning invoices to create “Lightning API keys”. This allows for separating the logic of payments, permissions, and request fulfillment.\nHere’s how L402 works:\nThis separation is perfect for distributed systems where issuance and verification should be decentralized.\nL402 enables per-use pricing of APIs in satoshis using Lightning Network micropayments. Companies can provide API keys to customers along with Lightning invoices.\nCustomers pay invoices to obtain the secret preimage and use the paid key for API access. Companies don’t need to check invoice payment, just validate the key.\nL402 allows pricing API use cases like per-request, tiered access, surge pricing, etc. It facilitates pay-as-you-go API monetization.\nL402 enables several key benefits for companies looking to monetize their APIs:\nWith L402, companies can implement per-use pricing for API access. Instead of a flat monthly fee, customers pay a small fee each time they call the API. This “pay as you go” approach is attractive for customers who want to try out an API or have variable usage needs. Companies can price API calls based on volume tiers and even implement surge pricing during peak demand.\nBy monetizing API usage, companies can reduce infrastructure costs. Revenue from API fees helps offset the server, bandwidth, and operational expenses required to host and maintain the API. Companies don’t have to overprovision capacity for infrequent spikes in usage, and the per-use pricing aligns costs with actual API usage.\nL402 provides instant settlement of API fees over the Lightning network. Companies get paid immediately when customers call the API, with no billing cycles or payment terms to worry about. This results in smoother, more predictable cash flow than monthly subscription plans. Companies don’t have to float API usage during the time between service delivery and customer payment.\nWith L402, access to the API is cryptographically tied to payment. Customers must present a valid L402 token to call the API, which is only issued after paying an invoice. This prevents freeloaders and enforces payment. Companies maintain full control over who can access the API. L402 also supports expiring tokens and rate limits for more advanced access policies.\nIntegrating L402 into an existing API infrastructure involves a few key steps:\nL402 allows the proxy to handle all permissioning and payment logic separately from the API implementation. This makes integrating monetization into an existing API easy with minimal code changes. The proxy validates each request so the API server can focus on serving responses.\nUsing the L402 protocol to monetize APIs provides several key benefits:\nL402 enables much more granular pricing models compared to traditional API monetization. Rather than a set monthly fee, you can charge per API call or request. This “pay as you go” approach allows for usage-based billing. Companies can customize dynamic pricing too based on demand, time of day, type of request, and other factors.\nBy leveraging usage-based billing, companies can generate more revenue from their APIs. They can capture more value from high-usage customers rather than capping monthly fees. This helps maximize monetization from your API investment.\nL402 reduces friction for API consumers since they only pay for what they use. There’s no large upfront commitment or monthly fee. This “pay as you go” model makes it easy for developers to integrate your API and grow usage over time.\nL402 provides better security by separating authentication and authorization from payment validation. The cryptographic mechanisms ensure validity of API requests. This prevents abuse or exploitation of the API. The protocol also enables delegated access so companies can securely share API access.\nMonetizing APIs can be challenging, but implementing solutions like the L402 protocol enables efficient and scalable monetization. Here’s a summary of the key points:\nYou can begin monetizing APIs over the Lightning Network today with Voltage, a Bitcoin Development platform that makes integrating Bitcoin and Lighting into your product or service easy with APIs and integrations.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-04-23T12:28:28-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Bobby Shell"},

This Bitcoin for dummies guide breaks down the immutable ledger of the blockchain, the crucial role of key pairs, the competitive world of mining, and the secure storage provided by Bitcoin. Additionally, the guide explores the concept of Bitcoin Halving, a unique method designed to control inflation and reinforce its scarcity.\nThink of the blockchain as a big book that keeps track of all the times people have sent or received bitcoin. Each transaction is written on a page of this book. When a page is filled with transactions, it gets added to a stack of other filled pages. Everyone can see this book and what’s written in it, but no one can erase or change the pages once they’re added. This makes it tough for anyone to cheat because to change any information, you’d need to rewrite the whole stack in many different books at the same time, and everyone would notice.\nKey pairs work like a combination of a mailbox and a secret code. Your mailbox (public key) is what you give to people so they can send you bitcoin. Your secret code (private key) is what lets you open your mailbox and send bitcoin to others. It’s crucial to keep your secret code safe because if someone else finds it, they can send your bitcoin away without your permission.\nMining is similar to playing a very intense, competitive game where people use their computers to solve a guessing puzzle. The first person to solve the puzzle gets to add a new page to the big book of transactions (this is called adding a block to the blockchain). As a reward for their hard work, they get some bitcoin. This process helps keep the system honest because it confirms that all the transactions are real, and by giving out new bitcoin, it also slowly increases the amount of bitcoin in circulation.\nIn the Bitcoin world, a wallet is where you keep your key pairs, which let you access your bitcoin. Unlike a regular wallet, which holds things like cash and cards, a Bitcoin wallet doesn’t store the bitcoin itself—instead, it holds the keys you use to access your bitcoin on the blockchain and manage transactions. You can have a wallet on your computer, your phone (called hot wallet), or even a special offline device meant just for Bitcoin(cold storage). Protecting your wallet is critical because if you lose access to your keys, you can’t access your bitcoin.\n“Bitcoin Halving is an event programmed into the Bitcoin protocol that occurs approximately every four years or 210,000 blocks. During this event, the reward that miners receive for confirming transactions and securing the network is halved.\nThis reduction in rewards ultimately decreases the rate at which new bitcoin is created, enforcing scarcity. The purpose of the Bitcoin Halving is to control the inflation rate of Bitcoin and ensure that the total supply remains limited to 21 million, making it a deflationary asset over time.”\nBitcoin, introduced in 2009 by an unknown person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, stands out as the first decentralized digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network that spans numerous computers worldwide. This network leverages blockchain technology—a type of public ledger that records all transactions openly and immutably—to maintain security and transparency without the need for intermediaries like banks.\nBitcoin is unique not only because it is digital and not issued by any central authority, but also because it has a predetermined limit on quantity. There can only ever be 21 million bitcoin, a measure designed to prevent inflation and mimic the scarcity of precious metals. Bitcoin is created through a process known as mining, where individuals use powerful computers to solve a guessing puzzle. Successful miners help process transactions and secure the network, and in return, they are rewarded with new bitcoin. This reward diminishes over time with an event referred to as “halving,” which gradually reduces the rate at which new bitcoin are introduced to the system.\nAndreas Antonopoulos provided a compelling introduction to Bitcoin seven years ago, explaining why civilization is shifting towards a cashless society and the significant role Bitcoin could play in the lives of future generations. He detailed the technological and societal trends leading us away from traditional paper and coin money, emphasizing how Bitcoin, with its decentralized and digital nature, offers a revolutionary alternative. Antonopoulos argued that Bitcoin not only aligns with the global trend towards digital transactions but also provides an inclusive financial system that could empower people worldwide, particularly those without access to traditional banking.\nA great starting point for beginners is the Bitcoin for dummy Guide by Luc Fiore called ‘Bitcoin 101’, available as a PDF. This guide offers a clear and comprehensive introduction to Bitcoin, covering essential concepts and addressing common misconceptions. It provides readers with a solid foundation in understanding how Bitcoin works and its potential impact on the financial world.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2024-04-18T12:14:09-04:00","tag":"Adoption","author":"Luis Lopez"},

This significant shift in trading dynamics could reflect broader changes in the Bitcoin market, or it could be a temporary halt. Let’s delve into the details of this development and its implications.\nBlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, known as IBIT, experienced zero inflows on Wednesday and Thursday, marking the first time in nearly three months since its launch that it failed to attract new investment. This streak had garnered attention as IBIT emerged as a frontrunner in the race among Bitcoin ETFs, securing the top spot in inflows and trading volume.\nThe halt in inflows for IBIT signals a potential turning point for the fund. Eric Balchunas, an ETF expert at Bloomberg, highlighted the significance of IBIT’s 71-day streak, noting its formidable performance since its launch. This development raises questions about the future trajectory of BlackRock’s ETF amid evolving market conditions.\nThe shift in IBIT’s inflow streak reflects broader trends in the Bitcoin market. Bullish traders have shown signs of reducing their positions as factors like the Bitcoin funding rate and declining demand influence market sentiment. Analysts suggest that the extended duration of neutral to below-neutral funding rates may indicate further price consolidation in the market.\nWhile BlackRock’s ETF had dominated headlines, other players in the market have faced challenges as well.\nGrayscale, one of the largest BTC holders, continued to experience outflows, contributing to downward pressure on bitcoin’s price. Additionally, the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various markets, including Hong Kong, has intensified competition and could reshape the landscape of these new investment vehicles.\nEric Balchunas pointed out that IBIT’s streak of 71 consecutive days highlights its impressive performance since it was introduced.\nJulio Moreno, lead researcher at CryptoQuant, also highlighted this event, mentioning that this pattern is discouraging traders from opening fresh long positions.\nVetle Lunde, an analyst at K33 Research, pointed out that the 11-day consecutive period of neutral to below-neutral funding rates is uncommon. Historically, similar occurrences have led to a surge in leveraged bets. Lunde speculates that the prolonged continuation of the current perpetual discount might signal more price stabilization in the market.\nRebecca Sin, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF Analyst stated:\n“We could see more outflows come as Hong Kong launches spot Bitcoin ETFs with two issuers waiving management fee.\nThe end of BlackRock’s 71-day inflow streak for its Bitcoin ETF marks a significant moment in the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment. As market dynamics continue to shift and competition intensifies, investors and analysts alike will closely monitor the implications for BlackRock and the broader digital assets market.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"04/27/2024","tag":"ETF","author":"Alex Lari"},

The Lightning network is a second-layer solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that speeds up transactions, making them a lot cheaper and almost instant.\nThe team did a great job digging into this, and we've made the decision to integrate Lightning. Bitcoin is the most important asset in crypto and we're excited to do our part to enable faster/cheaper Bitcoin transactions. Will take some time to integrate so please be patient. https://t.co/FneeXkLI25\nEarly in August, the business had stated that it was investigating Lightning support. On Wednesday, Armstrong announced on Twitter that this study was complete and Coinbase has “made the decision to integrate Lightning.” However, he did not say how long the integration is likely to take.\nWe’re looking into how to best add Lightning. It’s non-trivial, but I think worth doing. I’m all for payments taking off in Bitcoin. Not sure why you think we’re ignoring Bitcoin – we’ve onboarded more people to Bitcoin than probably any company in the world. Let’s build it… https://t.co/9dFGYd6XZt\nThe sluggish integration of Lightning by digital asset exchange giants has been the subject of speculative reasoning. According to one argument, customers may be less inclined to maintain their bitcoin on these exchanges if Lightning is made available because of the hefty withdrawal fees imposed on on-chain bitcoin withdrawals.\nAs a result, the integration would motivate them to regularly move their holdings off exchanges, which might lessen their reliance on the exchanges’ centralized wallets. Technical difficulties, regulatory issues, and the requirement to balance scalability with security are further contributing causes.\nAnother argument is that people hold on to their bitcoin rather than trade it, and with low liquidity implementing Lightning hasn’t made much sense.\nThe announcement comes after Coinbase released its financial results for the second quarter last month, which were easily above financial analysts’ expectation. Still, Coinbase shares value are currently trading down about 30% from their year-to-date high.\nDigital asset exchange giant Binance announced on July 17 that they successfully integrated Lightning payments into their exchange platform.\nThe breakthrough on Wednesday is just another milestone in the steady march toward the adoption of bitcoin Lightning payments, following in the footsteps of Strike, Jack Dorsey’s Cash App, David Marcus’ Lightspark, and most recently, Binance.\n\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-23T22:38:21-04:00","tag":"Markets","author":"Brian Kirubai"},

This increase comes as a result of the company’s recent agreement to acquire mining assets from bankrupt lender Celsius.\nThe mining company, affiliated with a consortium called Fahrenheit, successfully secured the Celsius assets through a bankruptcy auction. These assets encompass a lending portfolio, digital assets, and a fleet of 121,800 mining machines.\nWith plans to activate all these mining rigs, the company’s total fleet will exceed 270,000 mining rigs, propelling it into the league of mining giants like Core Scientific and Marathon Digital Holdings.\nAs part of the agreement with Celsius, US Bitcoin Corp. announced its intention to become the sole operator of the Celsius mining fleet through one or more operating and services agreements.\nAdditionally, it will be entitled to an annual management fee of $15 million for overseeing the mining assets, after deducting operating expenses, throughout the five-year period of rig management. This arrangement could potentially yield $75 million in revenue, subject to US Bitcoin Corp. meeting specific operational criteria.\nAccording to court documents, an additional $20 million in management fees will be allocated to the Fahrenheit consortium. Furthermore, the consortium will be granted stock incentives in the newly established company that will encompass the Celsius assets.\nIn addition to these obligations, US Bitcoin Corp. is tasked with constructing a 100-megawatt infrastructure to accommodate the Celsius rigs and presenting a detailed plan for expanding the capacity by an additional 240 MW.\nOver the past few months, the Miami-based company has significantly expanded its operational capacities by capitalizing on opportunities arising from bankruptcies.\nWhile initially operating from a single site in Niagara Falls, New York, it has now gained control of three additional sites previously managed by Compute North.

He discussed why it’s crucial for people to explore and consider incorporating bitcoin into their investment portfolios.\nHe defined bitcoin as a decentralized digital asset that presents an alternative way to protect value. Saylor also compared bitcoin and traditional assets, emphasizing the former’s potential for wealth preservation.\nMicroStrategy executive chairman broke down the concept of monetary inflation. He explained that while inflation is a vector, consumer inflation is a measure that tells us how prices are changing for products that are getting worse in quality over time.\nSaylor is popular for his extensive expertise and involvement in the bitcoin space.\nHe divides inflation into two categories. First, he considers consumer inflation, which represents the amount of money necessary for a person to maintain a modest, lower middle-class lifestyle. Second, he defines asset inflation as the rate of wealth generation required to either maintain one’s wealth or surpass it, if the goal is to become wealthier.\nSaylor pointed out that in the United States, asset inflation has historically hovered at around 7-8% for about a century, whereas consumer inflation has remained relatively stable at around 2% during the same period. However, he highlighted a recent surge in asset inflation, which he found interesting.\nSaylor also observed that outside the U.S., particularly in economically weaker nations, asset inflation rates often double and reach around 14% annually. He attributed this surge to the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, as these countries frequently run large deficits and resort to printing money to service debt they can’t pay back.\nConsequently, the prices of many scarce and resalable assets have risen at a faster rate than the 2% consumer inflation, and the money supply has expanded by 40% or more within just a couple of years.\nSaylor compared how fiat currencies steadily lose value due to inflation. He highlighted the risk of wealth erosion when holding traditional currencies, claiming that wealth stored in the U.S dollar over the past century would have lost roughly 99% of its value. He cautioned about similar risks in cases of political instability in weaker governments.\nSaylor believes bitcoin mitigates these risks with its built-in attributes. He sees bitcoin as revolutionary invention/discovery. Being capped at 21 million supply makes it a scarce, stable, non-inflationary, and therefore, sustainable monetary network. According to him, bitcoin is a means to preserve one’s economic energy from dissipating over time.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-27T19:56:01-04:00","tag":"Bitcoin","author":"Anisha Pandey"},

In comparison, gold ETFs had 95 professional firms invested in their first quarter.”\nLunde also pointed out the dominance of retail investors holding a significant majority of these ETFs, investing $47.96 billion as of the end of Q1 2024.\nThis represents 81.3% of the total assets under management (AUM) in bitcoin spot ETFs. On the other hand, professional investors held $11.06 billion, making up 18.7% of the bitcoin spot ETFs AUM.\nAccording to the data collected by Laude based on 13F filings, the biggest ETFs, Grayscale’s GBTC, BlackRock’s IBIT, and Fidelity’s FBTC, experienced a flow of $4.38 billion, $3.23 billion, and $2.10 billion from these firms, respectively.\nNotably, the 13F filings are quarterly reports submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by institutional investment managers with over $100 million in assets under management.\nThey provide a clear view of the increasing institutional interest in different investment vehicles, as they recently did with Bitcoin ETFs. According to this data, several financial giants have been significantly increasing their holdings in Bitcoin ETF shares.\nFor instance, Morgan Stanley has purchased 4.27 million shares of the GBTC, amounting to $269.8 million. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board also holds nearly $163 million worth of Bitcoin ETF holdings with IBIT and GBTC.\nSkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci recently predicted that more pension funds will follow the State of Wisconsin’s lead and add bitcoin to their investment portfolios.

And of course, Bitcoin now has regulatory approval. And I think that was the rate limiting step for a lot of these large-scale institutions.”\nScaramucci emphasized that Bitcoin remains in the early stages of adoption, suggesting that there is significant potential for growth as more institutions recognize the benefits of investing in the digital asset.\n“Sometimes when you’re early, you get a lot of bumps and scrapes.

One such period was during the great times of Ancient Greece, particularly in Athens.\nAthens in 400 BCE was very special, and remains special to our history, because this is where democracy was invented. Their democracy was different from our modern times democracy, though. Particularly when it comes to the involvement their citizens had in the day-to-day activities of the democracy. Athens had created a complex system of bankers and insurers to simplify the trade of grain and increase the security of investors’ portfolios. Many ships sunk in the Aegan sea during these times, these financial instruments allowed to protect one’s investment and share the risk of their business with the industry, through insurance.\nOf course, there were often disputes around these topics that needed to be settled in court. The court system in Athens was built to accommodate this particular type of issue, and was used for every other topic, too. Here are a few rules on how their court system worked:\nThe first point is important to the argument of this article: 500 people in the jury of each trial. At the time, Athens had 50,000 citizens (and an additional 100,000 slaves living within the city walls – were not counted as citizens and did not take part in the decisions of the city), so 500 people involved in each trial represented 1% of the population.\nImagine this in today’s world: 3.3 million Americans would have to be part of each jury. Or 14 million Chinese citizens would be involved. Sounds impossible, although we do have one technology that didn’t exist in Athens that could simplify the matter: the internet. Maybe this kind of jury could be re-adapted today? The outcome of trials wouldn’t be the source of such debate because 1% of randomly selected individuals can be considered a big enough sample to represent society as a whole for a given trial. Beyond leading to a fair trial system, it also leads to more transparency and lowers the powers of influence that sometimes exist for the important trials.\nIn his lifetime, the average Athenian attended multiple trials, including the complex ones, and faced topics such as finance, risk, long-term investment, compounding, etc. Today, we still have records of such trials. One example is the story of Demosthenes, Athenian that had his heritage stolen by his uncles because he was too young when his father died. As an adult, he took his uncles to trial. Here is an extract of his depiction of the situation:\n“My father, men of the jury, left two factories, both doing a large business. One was a sword-manufactory, employing thirty-two or thirty-three slaves, most of them worth five or six minae each and none worth less than three minae. From these my father received a clear income of thirty minae each year. The other was a sofa-manufactory, employing twenty slaves, given to my father as security for a debt of forty minae. These brought him in a clear income of twelve minae. In money he left as much as a talent loaned at the rate of a drachma a month, the interest of which amounted to more than seven minae a year… Now, if you add to this last sum the interest for ten years, reckoned at a drachma only you will find that the whole, principal and interest, amounts to eight talents and four thousand drachmae”. (2)\nHow many average citizens of our modern world would be able to follow such an argument? It mentions two businesses, loans, interest rates and their compounding effects. Today, most people don’t understand what compound interest is, and it is one of the most simple long term thinking concepts in finance.\nOur financial system has been layered with many levels of complexity and is presented as a complex topic, including when it comes to personal finance. I believe this has been done through time by the people working in the industry for two reasons:\nToday, people start to understand the impact inflation can have on their lives. They don’t necessarily understand where it comes from, but they understand that they need to do something about their personal finance or their savings will slowly be crushed by inflation. This inflationary way of thinking has always been there. This is part of the reason why people invest in real estate and has pushed the prices so high. Today, it is pushing people towards even riskier investments. This is part of the reason why the cryptocurrency world sees such a boom and seems so attractive to many: high reward, but also high risk.\nPeople entering cryptocurrency investing will slowly start making the distinction between bitcoin and “crypto” at some point (often because of a shitcoin losing 99% of its value or a hack making them lose their funds). We will write a follow-up article about this topic in particular: bitcoin is not crypto.\nBecause of the way bitcoin is built, people gain their financial independence. You are the sole owner of your assets and no one can take control of your assets unless you give access to them. This is extremely empowering, but can also be a scary endeavor: it has the potential of opening users up to more risk. This means that people need to take responsibility for their financial decisions. Every decision is their own, and in order to avoid mistakes, people need to educate themselves.\nThis education starts with understanding bitcoin wallets, but quickly moves on to more complex topics:\nAnd many more that one by one open up the mind to the way our financial system works. There are many great thinkers and contributors in the space that help understand these points.\nPeople are now forced to take control of their own funds and take responsibility for their personal finance. The veil that has always laid on the world of finance is slowly being lifted, and what used to be seen as very complex topics are becoming day-to-day topics for many. This is due to the fact that the trust that could once be relied upon our centralized financial institutions is now gone because of decades of abusing customers, bailouts, and more.\nThe Athenian system was not able to scale with the growing number of people in cities and in countries. But given our current technologies, is a similar system so hard to imagine today? Maybe bitcoin can be the asset that leads the way in this direction. Thanks to its cryptographic properties, but also thanks to the added benefit of its passive properties, including the fact users need to educate themselves, which can only benefit them and our society.\nWe’re working on a documentary project that will explore the actors that are trying to block bitcoin adoption in the world.

As a result, he strongly advises investors to withdraw their funds from all these exchanges.\nDrawing upon his extensive 19-year collaboration with the SEC, Stark expressed his belief that the regulatory actions taken against Coinbase and Binance could mark the beginning of a broader digital assets regulatory “siege” that may encompass other companies within the industry. Providing further insight, Stark elaborated on his perspective:\nGet out of crypto platforms now, I can’t say it any plainer. I believe that we now know for certain that crypto trading platforms are under a U.S. regulatory/law enforcement siege which has only just begun.\nGet out of crypto platforms now, I can't say it any plainer. Having worked as an attorney in the SEC Enforcement Division for almost 20 years (including 11 years as Chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement), I believe that we now know for certain that crypto trading…\nAdditionally, Stark emphasized his perspective that digital assets trading platforms are characterized as “high-risk, perilous, and inherently unsafe.” He further asserted that the SEC’s enforcement actions align with this viewpoint, indicating that the regulatory measures taken by the institution are moving in the right direction.\nIn the tweet, Stark highlighted the detrimental consequences of digital assets exchanges not registering with the SEC, saying it severely restricts the organization’s ability to “safeguard investors.”\nHe added that the absence of registration has created an environment in which these markets can operate with minimal supervision.\nStark provided additional details, emphasizing that the SEC faces significant limitations in terms of oversight, access, and the ability to effectively detect, investigate, and deter fraudulent activities within digital asset trading platforms.\nThe SEC has filed charges against Coinbase and Binance for operating unregistered trading platforms. However, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong responded to the SEC lawsuit by refuting the notion that the company could register its activities, citing multiple conversations with the organization.\nArmstrong recently expressed that there was no viable “path to ‘come in and register'” despite their repeated efforts, leading them to refrain from listing securities.\nSimilarly, lawmakers have joined in the criticism of the SEC’s position on this matter, accusing the institution of neglecting the digital assets industry.\nSenator Cynthia Lummis expressed her dissatisfaction, claiming that the SEC has not adequately facilitated the registration process for digital asset exchanges and has failed to offer sufficient legal guidance to differentiate between securities and commodities.\n© A Bitcoin-Focused Company | 256 Media, 2024\nGet weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!\n","create_date":"2023-10-27T19:56:30-04:00","tag":"Bitcoin","author":"Alex Lari"}
