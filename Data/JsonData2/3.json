The game, set to debut alongside the alpha release of the Pixelverse Playground, marks the second project to be launched on the platform.\nOn the mean streets of Xenon, a cyberpunk universe, Pixelverse offers players narrative-driven quests, player versus environment (PvE) battles, and the chance to collect valuable NFT items. There is also the opportunity to train unique ‚Äòbots‚Äô for competitive arena battles.\nIn this immersive world, players take on the role of freelancers tasked with gathering rare items to craft and enhance bots for supreme dominance in the arena. Thanks to Pixelchain and the Pixelverse SDK, all in-game assets, including freelancers and bots, are securely stored on-chain as NFTs. This ensures low-cost transactions and facilitates smooth integrations with third-party products.\nMoreover, the game‚Äôs ‚ÄòRisk to Earn‚Äô model introduces an extra competitive layer, allowing players to stake tokens on their performance, with victors claiming all rewards.\n\nLed by founder and CEO Kirill Volgin, Pixelverse aims to make a major impact on Web3 Gaming. Kirill‚Äôs prior project, StepApp, quickly generated $3.85 billion in volume, highlighting his prowess for leading innovative ventures.\nReflecting on Pixelverse‚Äôs journey up to the launch on Raiser.co, Kirill Volgin said, ‚ÄúThis is a brand new milestone for me. StepApp has shown itself to be the only move to earn project with an active userbase, sustainable and growing economy, and offering true innovation, it has been the market leader for a long time. I‚Äôve taken all of this experience and decided to give myself a new challenge and launch Pixelverse, along with an expert team with deep experience in the web3 and gaming space.‚Äù\nRaiser.co emerges as the launchpad for Pixelverse, created by Kori Leon, a former Binance listing manager. With a sales mechanic called FCO (Fair Community Offering), the platform‚Äôs approach to investment opportunities by rewarding users‚Äô crypto project promotion efforts makes it an ideal launchpad.\nFurthermore, Mahamadou Ciss√© joins the venture as Pixelverse‚Äôs CMO, bringing a wealth of experience from his time as strategy director with Cross The Ages.

Volgin added in the announcement, ‚ÄúWe are really looking forward to creating a cool game for everyone to play, not just web3 users but gamers with no experience in web3, and we really think that Raiser‚Äôs Fair Community Offering is the right approach for our go-to-market to engage with our new users and fans.‚Äù\nImmersive tech enthusiast, diving into the NFT currents reshaping the Metaverse.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

This time, the rewards will come in the form of up to 350 million PIXEL tokens, which will be distributed among participants in anticipation of the live launch of Ronin gaming token later this month.\nPIXEL is a native token associated with Pixels, a popular crypto game that operates on the Ronin network. The game‚Äôs token will be introduced alongside a Binance Launchpool promotion, providing users with incentives to participate in staking activities.\nBinance customers can earn PIXEL tokens by staking either the platform‚Äôs native token, BNB, or the FDUSD stablecoin in respective liquidity pools. This campaign will distribute 7% of the total PIXEL supply, which amounts to 350 million tokens.\n$PIXEL is launching on @binance Launchpool! üéâ 2023 was a landmark year for Pixels as we became one of the largest web3 games by DAU, which surpassed 180K. Our explosive growth can be attributed to two core factors: our community and our migration to Ronin, Sky Mavis‚Äô‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/atnyBBq0x3\nThe Launchpool promotion is set to begin on February 9 and will last for 10 days. Following this, the PIXEL token will be officially listed on Binance for trading starting from February 19.\nIt is still unclear whether Pixels will conduct airdrops of PIXEL tokens to players who have successfully completed the game‚Äôs play-to-airdrop campaigns. However, there is a possibility that around 28,000 wallets will be eligible based on their in-game achievements.\nPixels is a farming and life simulation game that operates on Ronin, an Ethereum scaling network designed specifically for gaming. The game was previously hosted on the Polygon network but made the move to Ronin in the fall of last year.\nSince the migration and introduction of play-to-airdrop campaigns, Pixels has contributed significantly to an increase in daily active users on the Ronin blockchain. This move has also helped to showcase the potential for blockchain technology and gaming, as well as driving adoption for both networks.\nThe upcoming Launchpool promotion from Binance is a great opportunity for users to earn PIXEL tokens and get involved in the growing world of blockchain-based gaming. With the official listing on Binance, more traders and investors will have access to the PIXEL token, potentially leading to an increase in its value.\nFurthermore, the success of Pixels and other games on Ronin has shown the potential for blockchain technology to transform the gaming industry. As more games and platforms continue to adopt blockchain, we can expect to see further growth and adoption in this exciting space.\nImmersive tech enthusiast, diving into the NFT currents reshaping the Metaverse.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

But this isn‚Äôt just a story about tokenomics; it‚Äôs a testament to the growing metaverse and the gaming communities rising within it.\nFirst launched in 2018, Ronin Network is a high-throughput layer-2 scaling solution geared towards enhancing user experiences in Ethereum-based games.\nWith the emergence of Axie Infinity in mid-2021, demand for the network services skyrocketed. The Ronin token, RON, now stands tall, having achieved an almost two-year high value that further cements its status as a leading blockchain gaming token..\nAxie Infinity is a play-to-earn NFT game, where players can battle, collect, and breed pet-like creatures called Axies. The game‚Äôs real-world trading volume attracted both gaming enthusiasts and cryptocurrency investors. Axie Infinity heralded a turning point in what gaming means to many‚Äîit became a profession, lifestyle, and investment opportunity all in one.\nIn support of this narrative, the recent launch of ‚ÄúEpic Era,‚Äù Axie Infinity‚Äôs seventh in-game season, saw a surge in user engagement, offering significant rewards in AXS and SLP tokens. Coupled with the sale of a rare Axie Infinity NFT for an astounding 105 Ethereum, the game solidified its position as a leading contender in the growing NFT gaming sector.\nDespite its substantial growth, the Axie Infinity ecosystem wasn‚Äôt impervious to challenges. Early 2022 witnessed setbacks, especially with discrepancies in the play-to-earn dynamics. The Ronin Network too faced a major hurdle with the multimillion-dollar hack which affected its security and users‚Äô trust. However, it‚Äôs often during crises that resilience emerges, and these incidents galvanized efforts to fortify the ecosystem.\nIn response, Sky Mavis, the developer of Axie Infinity, took commendable actions to restore stakeholder confidence. They not only reimbursed the affected but also redoubled their efforts to integrate third-party game studios into the flourishing Ronin Network. This strategic move, combined with rigorous security enhancements, has been a crucial part of the turnaround that‚Äôs now being witnessed.\nThe way Axie Infinity and its ecosystem have tackled these adversities is a testament to the commitment to their community and the fortitude with which they approach challenges. Of course, the ultimate beneficiaries are the players and investors whose trust in the system speaks volumes for its integrity.\nThe value surge of RON signifies more than just economic statistics. It‚Äôs a reflection of the growing solidarity within the gaming and NFT communities, a marker of the innovations emerging from the DeFi realm, and a herald for the promising future of NFT games. As we journey forward, it‚Äôs likely that the steps taken now‚Äîbe it through game development, security reinforcement, or economic model refinement‚Äîwill set the standards for the multiverses to come.\nIn conclusion, the ascent of the Ronin Network and the growth of the NFT market, illustrate the compelling narrative that‚Äôs shaping the digital age. The marriage of blockchain and entertainment isn‚Äôt a novelty anymore; it‚Äôs a thriving ecosystem with legions of players and real-world implications that are just starting to unfold.\nWeb3 advocate with a knack for breaking down complex concepts into engaging narratives.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

Learn about its unique features, successful campaigns, and impact on Ronin network.","title":"Successful Launch Propels PIXEL Token into Crypto Gaming","content":" The cryptocurrency market welcomed a new player on Monday morning with the launch of the PIXEL token. Its entry was marked by various play-to-airdrop campaigns and a rewards program on Binance Launchpool, which contributed to its rising value.\nPIXELS is a retro-style farming and social game, reminiscent of popular titles like Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. What sets it apart is its incorporation of a crypto token economy with NFT land plots and pets.\nInitially built on Polygon, PIXELS migrated to Ronin last fall ‚Äì a gaming-centric Ethereum scaling sidechain. This move aimed to improve the game‚Äôs blockchain infrastructure, providing a smoother and more efficient gaming experience for its users.\nThe current market capitalization of PIXEL is estimated at $441 million, based on its circulating supply. This puts it within the top 200 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the market. With 771 million tokens currently in circulation out of a maximum supply of 5 billion, the fully diluted valuation exceeds $2.8 billion.\nTo kickstart its entry into the market, Binance conducted a rewards campaign through its Launchpool platform. Customers who staked Binance Coin (BNB) or FDUSD stablecoin in designated liquidity pools for gaming tokens were eligible to receive 350 million PIXEL tokens. Following this successful campaign, Binance listed the PIXEL token for trading.\nAs a gesture of appreciation to its supporters on the Ronin network, PIXELS developers announced a surprise airdrop of 20 million tokens over a recent weekend. This move was well-received, as evidenced by a surge in daily active users from 20,000 to approximately 700,000.\nThe success of PIXELS has not only brought attention to the game itself but also contributed to the adoption of the Ronin network. Developed by Sky Mavis ‚Äì the team behind Axie Infinity, Ronin has been gaining recognition as a leading gaming blockchain network with the incorporation of more studios and games.\nIn conclusion, the launch of PIXEL token in the cryptocurrency market has been met with enthusiasm, thanks to its unique features and successful marketing strategies. As it continues to gain traction and contribute to the growth of Ronin network, we can expect to see more developments from both PIXELS and the gaming industry as a whole.\nVeteran gamer with a deep-seated interest in the evolving NFT and Web3 space.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

{"url":"https://nftnewstoday.com/2024/05/20/axie-infinity-introduces-community-voting-with-axie-score-system/","web_url":"https://nftnewstoday.com/","type":"article","description":"Axie Infinity launches Axie Governance Portal and Axie Score, empowering players to participate in game decisions by staking $AXS tokens and using their contributions to vote.","title":"Axie Infinity Introduces Community Voting with Axie Score System","content":" Axie Infinity has unveiled the Axie Governance Portal and Axie Score, marking a new era of player participation in the game‚Äôs evolution. By linking their Ronin Wallets and staking $AXS tokens, players can now directly influence the game‚Äôs decision-making by voting on significant proposals that impact the future direction of Axie Infinity.\nA central component of this new governance model is the Axie Score, a point system reflecting community members‚Äô contributions to the game. Essentially, the more value a community member adds to Axie Infinity, the higher their Axie Score. This score will modify a community member‚Äôs staked $AXS to compute their total voting power for decision-making.\nThe calculation of the Axie Score has been a topic of debate within the community, focusing on what types of contributions should be included and how their value should be measured over time. To address these concerns, Sky Mavis and the Axie Infinity Town Builders formed an inaugural committee to refine the Axie Score design.\nThe initial version of the Axie Score design includes four primary contribution categories: in-game performance, contributions to the Treasury, community contributions, and Axie NFT holdings. Each category will have specific badges representing individual contributions, and the total Axie Score will be the sum of all earned badges across these categories. Overall, this system aims to reflect a community member‚Äôs engagement and contributions to the ecosystem.\nThe first use of the Axie Score will be within the Axie Governance Portal, where it will modify voting power. To ensure the legitimacy of votes, community members must stake $AXS tokens to participate. The governance model also incorporates a quadratic modifier to prevent outsized influence from large holders and to value broader community input. ‚ÄúStake to Vote: We want to maximize the legitimacy of all votes within the community,‚Äù said the development team.\nThe first proposal, AIP-001, focuses on enabling enhanced delegation of Axie assets through a hard fork on the Ronin network. Voting for this proposal will open on May 20 and close on May 27. To participate, users should stake their $AXS tokens before the snapshot at 1:00 AM UTC on May 20.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud of this community, and we‚Äôre grateful for the Town Builders, the Contributors, the smart contract upgrade committee, and our fellow Axie Score committee members,‚Äù said the development team. ‚ÄúThis is a small yet significant step for Axie and gaming. Its full impact will only be understood over time.‚Äù\nFinally, Sky Mavis and the Axie Infinity team have emphasized that this initial release of the governance portal and Axie Score is just the beginning. They plan to continue refining these tools with community feedback to ensure a fair and engaging governance experience for all players.\nPassionate Metaverse wanderer and Web3 Analyst.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

These seemingly silly tokens, often with names like DEGEN, BRETT, and MFER, have been gaining traction in the trading world. And at the forefront of this trend is Base, a layer-2 scaling network developed by Coinbase.\nWith a daily record trading volume of $1.22 billion on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), Base has become a go-to platform for meme coin trading. This massive increase in activity has also led to a new record for unique daily wallets interacting with a DEX on the Base network, which reached 172,000 wallets according to data from Dune.\nOne of the main reasons for this surge in trading volume and daily active users on Base is Uniswap, a popular meme coin that has maintained a 90% daily share of Base DEX volume for several days. This dominance on the Base network has sparked speculation and anticipation among traders about a potential ‚ÄúBase season.‚Äù\nWith the rise in popularity of meme coins and the success of Uniswap on Base, there is now talk of a potential ‚ÄúBase season‚Äù similar to the frenzy seen on the Solana network. Many are curious to see if this trend will continue and extend to Base, making it a preferred platform for meme coin trading within the Ethereum ecosystem.\nIn addition to Uniswap‚Äôs success on Base, other meme coins have also started migrating to the network. New versions of these tokens have been launched on Base, indicating a growing interest in the platform.\nThe surge in activity and attention towards Base is a positive sign for Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 scaling network. It shows that there is a demand for faster and cheaper transactions, as well as an interest in trading meme coins within the Ethereum ecosystem.\nAs more meme coins migrate to Base and the platform continues to gain popularity, it has the potential to become a major player in the cryptocurrency market. Its ease of use, low fees, and fast transaction speeds make it an attractive option for traders looking to capitalize on the meme coin trend.\nIn conclusion, the rise of meme coins and the emergence of Base on Ethereum‚Äôs layer-2 scaling network is a clear indication of the ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. With its impressive trading volume, growing user base, and potential for further growth, Base may just be the next big thing in the world of decentralized trading.

The popular NFT game is launching a free-to-play version titled 'Unclogged' with new features.","title":"Dookey Dash: Unclogged Unveils $1M Prize Pool For Free To Play Launch","content":" If you‚Äôre familiar with the world of NFTs, chances are you‚Äôve heard of the highly popular Bored Ape Yacht Club and their hit game, Dookey Dash. The game took the NFT world by storm last year with its limited release that restricted gameplay to NFT owners only. But now, it‚Äôs set to make a comeback this spring with a free-to-play version titled ‚ÄúUnclogged‚Äù ‚Äì and it‚Äôs bringing some exciting new features along for the ride.\nThe original version of Dookey Dash required players to own a specific NFT in order to play, which limited its audience. However, the upcoming ‚ÄúUnclogged‚Äù version is set to target a wider audience by eliminating the NFT requirement for gameplay. This move has been met with both excitement and skepticism from fans and critics alike, making it worth taking a closer look at the evolution of this beloved game.\nDookey Dash was first released in 2021 as an ‚Äúendless runner‚Äù game where players navigate a vehicle through sewer obstacles, aiming to achieve the highest score on the global leaderboard.\nHowever, what set this game apart from others was its exclusive access ‚Äì it could only be played by owners of certain NFTs. These included Bored Apes and Mutant Apes, as well as other specific NFTs like the Bored Ape Kennel Club, HV-MTL, and Otherside Kodas.\nThe limited access to the game created a frenzy among NFT collectors, with many purchasing these exclusive tokens just to gain entry to Dookey Dash. The demand for these NFTs skyrocketed, with one professional Fortnite player even selling his prize NFT for a whopping $1.63 million worth of Ethereum.\nFast forward to this spring, and Dookey Dash is making a comeback with ‚ÄúUnclogged‚Äù ‚Äì a free-to-play version of the game that eliminates the NFT requirement for gameplay. This move by Yuga Labs, the creators of Dookey Dash, is aimed at attracting a wider audience and making the game more accessible to all.\nBut don‚Äôt worry, NFT owners won‚Äôt be left out in the cold. Yuga Labs has announced that specific NFT owners, including Bored Apes and Mutant Apes, will still receive certain benefits within the game. This includes a 72-hour early access period starting March 6 for 10,000 players, where the top scorer will be awarded a coveted Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT.\nIn addition to eliminating the NFT requirement for gameplay, ‚ÄúUnclogged‚Äù is set to bring some exciting new features and collaborations. The game is being developed in collaboration with crypto gaming startup Faraway and will allow users to create and sell their own 3D assets within the game.\nThis adds a whole new layer of interactivity and customization for players, making it more than just a simple endless runner game. And speaking of collaborations, ‚ÄúUnclogged‚Äù is set to feature brand collaborations, including an appearance by the iconic ape mascot from the popular streetwear brand Bape. This follows a previous clothing collaboration between the companies and is sure to bring even more hype to the game.\nAs the release of ‚ÄúUnclogged‚Äù draws closer, it‚Äôs clear that Dookey Dash is evolving into much more than just a hit game for NFT owners. With its potential to attract a wider audience and offer new features like customization and collaborations, it could very well be a game changer for the world of NFT gaming.\nOnly time will tell if ‚ÄúUnclogged‚Äù will live up to the success of its predecessor, but one thing is for sure ‚Äì Dookey Dash and the Bored Ape Yacht Club have once again captured the attention of NFT enthusiasts everywhere. So mark your calendars for March 6 and get ready to join in on the fun with ‚ÄúDookey Dash: Unclogged‚Äù ‚Äì the evolution of Bored Ape Yacht Club‚Äôs hit game.\nWeb3 advocate with a knack for breaking down complex concepts into engaging narratives.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

With its unique concept and advanced technology, Colony has already generated buzz in the gaming community.\nAccording to a white paper published by Parallel Studios on March 14, Colony aims to advance the use of AI agents within blockchain gaming and general-purpose applications. The game introduces AI-powered agents with continuous learning abilities, allowing for the development of unique personalities and worldviews.\nPlayers‚Äô interactions with these agents start by defining their fundamental traits, which evolve over time and lead to autonomous decision-making.

Find out how it works on OpenSea.","title":"Enforcing NFT Royalties: OpenSea's Integration Of The ERC-721C Standard","content":" As the NFT industry continues to grow, one major concern has emerged‚Äîhow can creators be properly compensated for their work? The introduction of the ERC-721C token standard and its integration into the popular NFT marketplace OpenSea have tackled this issue head-on.\nERC-721C stands for ‚ÄúEthereum Request for Comment ‚Äì 721 Collection‚Äù and is a token standard developed specifically for non-fungible tokens. Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are unique digital assets that cannot be replicated or exchanged for another token of equal value. The ERC-721C standard was first developed by blockchain gaming company Limit Break in May of last year to address the issue of creators not receiving proper compensation for their works in secondary markets.\nOne of the main features of ERC-721C is the ability for creators to enforce royalties on their works directly through the blockchain. This means that whenever an NFT is resold on a secondary market, the creator will automatically receive a percentage of the sale price as compensation.\nThis feature addresses the problem of ‚Äúwash trading‚Äù where individuals would evade paying creator royalties by using self-custody wallets or trading on platforms that did not respect set royalties. With ERC-721C, creators can ensure they are properly compensated for their work even in secondary market transactions.\nThe compatibility for ERC-721C on OpenSea was made possible after the Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum network on March 13. This integration allows creators to enforce earnings via ERC-721C and ensures that sales are only supported on OpenSea and other Limit Break‚Äôs Payment Processor-powered marketplaces. This means that creators have more control over the conditions of their NFT sales, further protecting their earnings.\nIn addition to the integration with OpenSea, creators can also utilize Seaport 1.6, OpenSea‚Äôs protocol that allows for NFT sales under specific conditions. This further enhances the control creators have over their NFT sales and allows them to set certain parameters, such as enforcing royalties or only allowing sales on specific marketplaces.\nThe integration of ERC-721C into OpenSea and other NFT marketplaces is a major step towards fair compensation for creators in the NFT world. By standardizing conditions for token transfers, including royalties, creators can ensure that their work is not undervalued or underpaid. This also incentivizes fair trading practices and protects the integrity of the NFT industry.\nIn conclusion, ERC-721C is a game-changing token standard that addresses the issue of creator earnings in the NFT world. Its integration into OpenSea and other marketplaces allows for automatic enforcement of royalties, giving creators more control over their earnings and protecting the industry from wash trading practices. As the NFT industry continues to evolve, ERC-721C will play a crucial role in ensuring fair compensation for creators and further legitimizing this exciting new digital asset class.\nNFT market analyst with a sharp eye for trends shaping the NFT sector.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

Designed for institutional and professional traders, DEEP aims to solidify DeepBook as a player in the Web3 financial landscape. With its official release set for later this year, early adopters can get their hands on a unique soulbound NFT, paving the way for an innovative token claim process.\nThe DEEP token system operates through four primary mechanisms: volume-based fees, maker incentives, stake-dependent participation, and stake-based governance. The details of these mechanisms are provided in the DeepBook token whitepaper, giving transparency to all participants. The token claim process utilizes a soulbound NFT that is non-transferable and tied to the recipient‚Äôs wallet. Upon launch, holders can convert their DBClaimNFT into liquid DEEP tokens.\nDeepBook‚Äôs DBClaimNFT is an example of this emerging asset class, demonstrating the potential for NFTs to play functional roles in governance and network participation.\nDeepBook‚Äôs architecture includes volume-based fees and incentives for liquidity providers, encouraging active participation in the network. Staking DEEP tokens also grants users a role in governing liquidity pools.\nTo guard against wash trading, any tokens gained by a pool in a given epoch will always match or exceed the tokens it issued, with any excess being burned. Furthermore, as the total activity increases, the incentives decrease significantly, reducing the motivation for traders to create fake volume.\nAdditionally, DeepBook aims to prevent governance manipulation by simplifying rule-making. Traders may vote for lower fees, but such changes affect all transactions equally. This ensures no specific group can tailor fee structures to their advantage, promoting fairness.\nSoulbound tokens (SBTs) might transform how we manage digital identities and ownership, streamlining the verification of personal details like educational records or medical history. They could smoother processes like KYC and help build solid digital reputations based on real-world achievements.\nBeyond identification, SBTs could reshape gaming by awarding non-tradeable achievements, ensuring fair voting in decentralized organizations, preventing ticket reselling for events, and protecting artists‚Äô intellectual property by tying their creations directly to their digital identity. This speculative leap into SBTs promises a future where digital assets become more personal and secure.\nPassionate Metaverse wanderer and Web3 Analyst.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

Learn how these digital tokens are transforming ownership and value.","title":"Exploring The Potential Of NFTs And Real World Assets","content":" In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. As this industry continues to evolve, new and innovative use cases for these technologies have emerged. One such example is the connection between non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and real-world assets. This connection has sparked a new wave of excitement and potential for both NFTs and traditional tangible assets.\nBefore diving into the ways in which NFTs are transforming real-world asset ownership, it‚Äôs important to understand what exactly constitutes a ‚Äúreal-world asset.‚Äù Simply put, real-world assets refer to any physical or tangible object that holds value. This can include a wide range of items such as real estate, fine art, precious metals, collectibles (e.g., trading cards or vintage items), and even intellectual property.\nWhile these assets have long been seen as valuable and desirable investments, traditional ownership has often been limited to those with significant wealth. However, the rise of NFTs has opened up new possibilities for ownership and investment in these high-value assets.\nNFTs offer several unique benefits when it comes to owning and investing in real-world assets. Let‚Äôs explore some of the ways in which NFTs are transforming traditional ownership.\nOne key advantage of using NFTs for real-world assets is the ability to enable fractional ownership. This means that instead of needing to purchase an entire asset, individuals can now invest in a portion of it. For example, instead of purchasing an entire piece of artwork, investors can buy a fraction of it through an NFT. This can greatly lower the barriers to entry for high-value assets and open up investment opportunities to a wider range of individuals.\nTraditionally, real-world assets have been considered illiquid investments. This means that they are not easily bought or sold on the open market. However, with NFTs, these assets can be tokenized and traded on digital marketplaces, making them much more liquid. This can attract more investors and create a more active market for these assets.\nNFTs are built on blockchain technology, which provides a secure and immutable record of ownership. This means that the ownership of real-world assets represented by NFTs is transparent and cannot be altered or falsified. Additionally, blockchain technology can also track the provenance of an asset, ensuring its authenticity. This level of transparency and authenticity can increase trust in the market for real-world asset ownership.\nAnother potential benefit of utilizing NFTs for real-world assets is the reduction of transaction costs. With traditional ownership, there are often various intermediaries involved in a transaction, which can drive up costs. However, with NFTs, these transactions can be streamlined and potentially eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.\nThe potential use cases for NFTs in relation to real-world assets are vast and continue to expand. Some notable examples include:\nReal estate tokenization: NFTs can be used to represent ownership of a property, allowing individuals to invest in real estate without needing to purchase an entire property.\nArt NFTs: Many artists are now creating and selling their work as NFTs, providing a new avenue for buying and selling art and supporting emerging artists.\nNFTs for luxury goods authentication: Brands can use NFTs to verify the authenticity of high-end luxury goods, protecting consumers from purchasing counterfeit items.\nCollectibles on the blockchain: NFTs are being used to create digital collectibles, such as unique trading cards or virtual items in video games.\nSource: Depositphotos\nAs with any emerging technology, there are also challenges and considerations when it comes to using NFTs for real-world assets. Some of these include:\nThe regulatory landscape for NFTs and real-world asset tokenization is still evolving. As these technologies gain popularity, it‚Äôs important for regulators to establish guidelines to protect investors and ensure compliance.\nOne challenge of utilizing NFTs for real-world assets is accurately valuing the assets represented by the tokens. As traditional ownership structures are disrupted, new methods of valuation may need to be developed.\nFor NFTs to reach their full potential, user experience will play a crucial role. Platforms and marketplaces must be user-friendly and accessible for those without extensive technical knowledge to encourage wider adoption.\nWhile there are certainly hurdles to overcome, the potential impact of NFTs on real-world asset ownership is significant. As blockchain technology continues to advance and become more widely adopted, we can expect to see even more use cases emerge for NFTs in relation to tangible assets. This has the potential to democratize ownership and investment opportunities and bring a new level of transparency and efficiency to traditional markets.\nIn conclusion, NFTs are transforming traditional ownership of real-world assets through fractional ownership, enhanced liquidity, transparency and authenticity, and reduced transaction costs. The use cases for NFTs in relation to real-world assets are diverse and continue to expand, but there are also challenges and considerations that must be addressed. However, as technology evolves and adoption increases, the future looks bright for NFTs in transforming asset ownership.\nSo, whether you‚Äôre an investor looking for new opportunities or a business exploring the potential of NFTs, it‚Äôs important to stay informed and be ready for the possibilities that lie ahead. With NFTs, ownership is no longer limited to physical possession ‚Äì it‚Äôs taking on a whole new digital dimension. So, let‚Äôs embrace this exciting evolution in asset ownership and see where it takes us in the future.\nFeatured Image: Depositphotos\nImmersive tech enthusiast, diving into the NFT currents reshaping the Metaverse.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

This decision forced NFT Worlds to reevaluate its approach and led to a complete rebranding to Hytopia.\nWith its ban on NFTs, Minecraft disrupted the operation of NFT Worlds, which had achieved substantial trading volume through the sale of in-game land NFTs. This move not only affected the revenue stream of NFT Worlds but also raised questions about the future feasibility and sustainability of this business model. It was a tough blow for the project, which had gained significant traction in the NFT market.\nIn response to Minecraft‚Äôs ban, the creators of NFT Worlds took an innovative approach by creating their own game, Hytopia, and accompanying blockchain, Hychain. This move aims to establish an independent platform for gaming that does not rely on centralized entities with closed ecosystems. By doing so, Hytopia and Hychain hope to avoid any future disruptions caused by external factors.\nAs Hytopia gears up for its launch, the project has announced the sale of Hychain Guardian Nodes. This strategy is similar to that of Xai, a layer-3 gaming chain on the Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum, which successfully conducted a significant airdrop for node key owners. By offering this unique opportunity to early investors, Hytopia and Hychain aim to generate interest and support for their upcoming launch.\nThe launch of Hytopia and its underlying blockchain technology, Hychain, represents an effort to create a decentralized gaming ecosystem. By offering its own chain for other game studios to build upon and introducing a native token, the project seeks to establish a new paradigm in the gaming industry. This could potentially challenge established Web2 gaming platforms that rely on centralized control and ownership.\nAdditionally, the use of NFTs in Hytopia has the potential to transform in-game economies, giving players true ownership and control over their virtual assets. This could lead to new opportunities for players to monetize their gaming experience and even create a career out of it.\nFurthermore, by utilizing blockchain technology, Hytopia and Hychain aim to address issues such as cheating and fraud in gaming. The transparent and immutable nature of the blockchain makes it difficult for players to cheat or manipulate the game, fostering a fair and secure environment for all.\nThe rebranding of NFT Worlds to Hytopia and the creation of its accompanying blockchain Hychain is a bold move that aims to transform the gaming industry. By offering an independent platform for gaming and utilizing NFTs and blockchain technology, Hytopia and Hychain have the potential to challenge traditional Web2 gaming platforms and create a more fair and secure environment for gamers. With its launch approaching, the future looks promising for this innovative project.\nVeteran gamer with a deep-seated interest in the evolving NFT and Web3 space.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

The games have gained a dedicated following for their immersive gameplay and gripping narratives.\nCross the Ages is a card-battling game that utilizes non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as trading cards, minted on Immutable X, a scaling solution for the Ethereum network. NFTs have gained immense popularity in recent years, with their ability to provide verifiable ownership and scarcity for digital assets, making them a perfect fit for the world of gaming.\nUbisoft‚Äôs collaboration with Cross the Ages is not just an exciting addition to their gaming portfolio but also a strategic investment. In March 2022, Ubisoft participated in a $12 million investment round for Cross the Ages, further solidifying their interest and involvement in the crypto and NFT space.\nUbisoft is not the only major gaming company to recognize the potential of NFTs. Square Enix, known for creating popular titles like Final Fantasy, also invested in Cross the Ages as a strategic investor. This move highlights the growing interest of traditional gaming companies in the NFT market and its potential to revolutionize the industry.\nIn addition to their investment in Cross the Ages, Ubisoft is further exploring blockchain technology with plans to release an original blockchain game called Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles on the Oasys platform.

These tokens serve as a crucial element in the Shrapnel ecosystem, providing rewards for early access competitions, enabling player-created content, and facilitating community votes. With so much riding on the SHRAP token, it‚Äôs no surprise that Neon Machine has recently announced a revision in its unlock schedule.\nThe SHRAP token unlock schedule outlines when and how many tokens will become available for use. This information is essential for both investors and players, as it gives insight into the availability of tokens and potential impact on market prices.\nInitially, Neon Machine had planned to unlock a large number of tokens in April. However, after careful consideration, they have decided to spread out these allocations over a more extended period. This adjustment results in nearly 75% fewer tokens being unlocked in April and aligns with the project‚Äôs overall goal of ensuring its long-term sustainability.\nThe revised SHRAP token unlock schedule is just one part of a more comprehensive revision by Neon Machine. This revision aims to alter the token unlock dynamics and better align with the project‚Äôs ambitions to become a global entertainment franchise. By starting with their flagship PC game and slowly increasing the rate of token unlocks as the user base expands, Neon Machine is setting themselves up for long-term success.\nThe new unlock schedule introduces a non-linear structure, starting with a lower rate of token unlocks that will accelerate as the user base and utility of SHRAP grows. This approach takes into account the potential impact on market prices and ensures that tokens are released in a controlled manner. By slowly increasing the available supply, Neon Machine can mitigate any potential negative effects on the SHRAP token‚Äôs value.\nThe SHRAP token unlock schedule is of particular interest to crypto investors as it indicates when more tokens will become available. As with any cryptocurrency, increased circulation can potentially affect market prices. However, by spreading out the unlocks and continuously monitoring market conditions, Neon Machine is taking a proactive approach to ensure the project‚Äôs and its economy‚Äôs sustainability.\nIn addition to the revised unlock schedule, Shrapnel has also launched an early access version on PC via the Epic Games Store. This launch is supported by millions in SHRAP tokens for weekly competitions, giving players even more incentive to get involved in the Shrapnel gaming ecosystem. With its combination of innovative gameplay and the potential for rewards, Shrapnel is already making a name for itself in the blockchain gaming world.\nThe recent announcement of a revision in the SHRAP token unlock schedule by Neon Machine is significant news for both investors and players.

This move aims to enhance customer engagement and capitalise on the significant growth projected in the global loyalty market.\nAccording to a recent report, the global loyalty market is expected to increase from US$135,903.9 million in 2023 to US$217,371.1 million by 2028, marking a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.5%. But what about Web3‚Äôs impact on this growing and innovative sector?\nWeb3 loyalty programs are changing the game for customer rewards, using blockchain to create a more engaging way to keep customers returning. At the heart of these programs are smart contracts, which are essentially automated rules that manage how rewards are earned and used.\nOffering NFTs as part of loyalty programs is catching on, mirroring the broader shift towards digital rewards. This strategy provides an innovative way for both online and omnichannel retailers to build meaningful relationships with customers who are enthusiastic about the latest technological trends.\nCustomers join these programs by using a digital wallet to collect their tokens, which they can earn through purchasing products, engaging with the brand, or participating in special Web3 activities.\nWhat sets Web3 loyalty programs apart is the level of ownership and transparency they offer. Customers can own their rewards and be free to trade or sell them, a big leap from traditional loyalty programs. These programs also build a stronger community feel as customers get more involved in the brand‚Äôs world.\nExamples include NFTs that unlock special brand experiences, tokens that customers can earn and use for discounts or trade, and dynamic NFTs that change based on customer behavior. This innovative approach to loyalty programs shows how brands think differently about engaging with their customers, making the experience more personalized, secure, and enjoyable.\nAs the digital landscape evolves, companies like Visa, Moonbeam Network, and Lufthansa are leading the charge in integrating Web3 capabilities into their loyalty schemes.\nVisa‚Äôs announcement of a Web3 loyalty service highlights the trend towards gamified experiences and digital wallets, emphasizing the sector‚Äôs shift towards more immersive customer interaction methods.\nSimilarly, the collaboration between Moonbeam Network, DUX, and Grupo RAO signifies the potential for cross-industry partnerships to foster innovative loyalty solutions, especially in emerging markets like Brazil.\nLufthansa‚Äôs venture into an NFT-powered loyalty program with Polygon further illustrates the industry‚Äôs move towards leveraging blockchain technology to provide unique and value-added services to customers.\nThese initiatives not only showcase the sector‚Äôs growing innovation but also highlight the strategic alliances forming to launch Web3 loyalty programs, emphasizing the importance of collaboration in this new digital frontier.\nThe shift towards Web3-powered loyalty programs indicates a broader transformation in how businesses engage with customers. Companies aim to create a more immersive and interactive experience that fosters deeper customer loyalty by offering more than just transactional benefits.\nUsing digital wallets and NFTs to store rewards and experiences represents a significant departure from traditional loyalty models, offering customers greater flexibility and value.\nWeb3 loyalty programs are in their infancy, with many projects still in the conceptual stage or just beginning pilot tests. The true potential of these programs at a large scale will become clear as they navigate the complexities of evolving technology and strive for real-world application and success.\nAs the global loyalty market continues to expand, experts expect the integration of Web3 technologies to play a crucial role in shaping the future of customer engagement strategies.\nLooking ahead to 2024 and beyond, the proliferation of Web3-powered loyalty initiatives could redefine the paradigms of customer loyalty and retention strategies, establishing a new standard for how businesses cultivate and maintain customer relationships.\nImmersive tech enthusiast, diving into the NFT currents reshaping the Metaverse.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

However, one major hurdle that continues to hinder the widespread adoption of NFTs is high gas fees.\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will explore the concept of gas fees in relation to NFT transactions and provide proven strategies for reducing these costs. Whether you are a creator or collector, understanding how to minimize gas fees can greatly benefit your experience in the NFT space.\nBefore discussing strategies for reducing gas fees, it‚Äôs important to understand what they are and why they matter in the context of NFTs. In simple terms, gas fees are the transaction fees paid on the Ethereum blockchain for executing smart contracts.\nIn the world of NFTs, gas fees are a crucial aspect as they are required for minting and trading these unique digital assets. High gas fees can greatly impact the profitability and accessibility of NFTs, making it essential to find ways to minimize them.\nGas fees are determined by the network congestion, the complexity of the smart contract, and the type of marketplace used for NFT transactions. As more users interact with the Ethereum blockchain, network congestion increases and leads to higher gas fees. Additionally, the more complex a smart contract is, the more gas it will require for execution. This can be a significant factor for NFT creators who want to optimize their smart contracts to minimize gas fees.\nHigh gas fees not only affect creators, but also impact NFT collectors. For collectors, high gas fees can greatly reduce the profitability of buying and selling NFTs. This can discourage new users from entering the market and limit the potential growth of the NFT ecosystem.\nMoreover, there is a growing concern about the sustainability of blockchain technology and its environmental impact due to high gas fees. As more attention is focused on the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies, finding ways to reduce gas fees becomes even more important.\nSource: Depositphotos\nNow that we understand the implications of high gas fees in the world of NFTs, let‚Äôs explore some proven strategies for reducing these costs.\nOne simple yet effective strategy is to time your NFT transactions during low-fee periods. By tracking network congestion data, you can identify periods when gas fees are typically lower and plan your transactions accordingly. This can significantly reduce the overall cost of NFT transactions.\nFor creators, optimizing smart contracts is a key way to minimize gas fees. Simplifying and streamlining the code of an NFT smart contract can greatly reduce its gas consumption, resulting in lower fees. This requires a deeper understanding of smart contract coding and can be achieved through thorough testing and optimization.\nLayer 2 solutions are becoming increasingly popular as a way to mitigate gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain. These solutions operate off-chain, allowing for faster and more cost-efficient transactions. Platforms like Immutable X and Polygon are examples of layer 2 solutions that are NFT-friendly and can greatly reduce gas fees for creators and collectors.\nWhen it comes to buying and selling NFTs, choosing the right marketplace can make a significant difference in gas fees. Different marketplaces have different fee structures and gas efficiency, so it‚Äôs important to do your research and compare options before making a transaction.\nAs blockchain technology continues to evolve, there are promising advancements on the horizon that could greatly reduce gas fees for NFT transactions. Ethereum 2.0, with its move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, is expected to significantly lower network congestion and gas fees.\nOther blockchain solutions, such as Tezos and Polkadot, also offer potential alternatives for more cost-effective NFT transactions.\nFurthermore, new NFT standards and protocols are being developed with a focus on improving gas efficiency. Projects like EIP-2309 and ERC-1155 aim to provide better gas optimization for NFTs, making them more accessible to a wider audience.\nHigh gas fees continue to be a major barrier for the growth and sustainability of the NFT market. However, with proper understanding and strategic implementation of the above-mentioned strategies, creators and collectors can work towards reducing these costs.\nAs blockchain technology evolves and new solutions emerge, we can look forward to a future where NFT transactions are more accessible and cost-efficient for all users. With a constantly expanding community and endless possibilities for digital ownership, the potential of NFTs is truly limitless. So don‚Äôt let gas fees hold you back from exploring this exciting world ‚Äì take control of your costs and dive into the world of NFTs today!\nFeatured Image: Depositphotos\nNFT market analyst with a sharp eye for trends shaping the NFT sector.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

Earn real-world money while gaming and master the strategies to boost your digital revenue.","title":"Play-to-Earn Blockchain Games: Your Guide to Earning While Gaming","content":" Imagine a world where your love for gaming could translate into not just hours of fun, but also cold, hard cryptocurrency. Play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain games are transforming the gaming industry, offering players the chance to earn real-world money through their in-game pursuits.\nBut how can you, as a gamer, crypto enthusiast, or tech investor, dip your toes into this burgeoning domain? This comprehensive guide will walk you through the world of P2E games, from grasping the basics to masterfully strategizing your digital revenue.\nBefore you can start your P2E adventure, it‚Äôs crucial to lay a solid foundation in blockchain technology and its offshoots like cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These are the building blocks of games that offer more than just escapist entertainment.\nWhat is Blockchain Technology?\nAt its core, blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger used to record transactions across multiple computers. It guarantees a level of security and transparency that traditional centralized systems can‚Äôt match. For P2E games, this means true ownership of your in-game assets without fear of them being lost or stolen.\nCryptocurrencies 101\nCryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security. They operate on a blockchain and come in different types, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most well-known. In P2E games, you might earn or trade in-game tokens, which often have real-world value thanks to their status as cryptocurrencies.\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) Unpacked\nNFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item or piece of content. In P2E, NFTs range from weapons and avatars in fantasy games to digital real estate.\nP2E Gaming Mechanics\nP2E games leverage blockchain to allow players to earn valuable tokens by participating in various in-game activities and quests. These tokens can then be traded on NFT marketplaces or staked for potential earnings.\nHere‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to entering the P2E realm:\nA secure crypto wallet, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, is your gateway to the P2E universe. It‚Äôs where you‚Äôll store and manage your game assets.\nSelect a game that matches your interests and skill level. Here are a few recommendations:\nIf the game requires it, acquire the necessary tokens or NFTs through an exchange or the game‚Äôs marketplaces.\nUnderstand how to play the game effectively and engage with its economy.\nSource: Depositphotos\nNow that you‚Äôre all set up, it‚Äôs time to start earning in the world of P2E (Play-to-Earn) games. Here are some strategies that can help you improve your gameplay and maximize your profits:\nPlaying the Game: Unlike traditional video games, P2E games reward players with tokens for their time and skill. You can earn tokens by performing various activities such as farming, battling or trading cards. It‚Äôs important to identify the core activities that yield the most returns and integrate them into your gameplay.\nTrading NFTs: Once you‚Äôve accumulated assets, you can consider selling them on NFT marketplaces. To get the best results, conduct market research to understand item values, demand, and timing.\nStaking Tokens: Some P2E games offer staking as a way to earn passive income. By locking your tokens, you can support the game‚Äôs economy and potentially receive interest over time.\nCreating Content: In certain P2E universes, creating and selling content can be a lucrative option. Whether it‚Äôs a custom avatar or a map for the community, your creativity can yield rewards beyond the basic gameplay.\nPlease keep in mind the important factors mentioned below before starting your P2E adventure.\nMarket Volatility: Cryptocurrency, and consequently, P2E earnings, are subject to significant price fluctuations. Hence, it is advisable to invest only what you can afford to lose and not rely solely on P2E as a consistent source of income.\nInitial Investments: Some P2E games require an initial investment, while many others are free to play. It is important to consider the upfront costs and ensure that they align with your financial goals.\nDo Your Research: It is vital to thoroughly research a game‚Äôs tokenomics, developer team, and community before committing to it. Understanding the underlying game and token economy can help you make informed decisions.\nThe idea of earning money while playing games is undoubtedly attractive, but it is important to approach Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming with caution and a realistic mindset. P2E gaming is a new and exciting frontier that offers the potential for both fun and financial reward, but it‚Äôs not a guaranteed way to get rich. With careful preparation, thorough research, and some knowledge of gaming, you can explore the world of P2E games and potentially turn your in-game skills into a new source of income. So, start your P2E adventure today, and enjoy the future of digital economics!\nFeatured Image: Depositphotos\nNFT market analyst with a sharp eye for trends shaping the NFT sector.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

{"url":"https://nftnewstoday.com/2024/03/29/understanding-erc-998-composable-nfts-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/","web_url":"https://nftnewstoday.com/","type":"article","description":"Discover the power of ERC-998: the extension to the ERC-721 standard that revolutionizes NFT ownership structures on Ethereum.","title":"Understanding ERC-998: Composable NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain","content":" The current standard for NFTs on Ethereum, ERC-721, has limitations when it comes to representing complex ownership structures. Enter ERC-998 ‚Äì an extension of the ERC-721 standard that allows for composable NFTs, transforming the way we think about digital assets on the blockchain.\nERC-998 is a standardized contract interface that extends the functionality of ERC-721 tokens. It introduces a new feature called ‚Äúcomposability,‚Äù which enables an NFT to own other NFTs (ERC-721) or fungible tokens (ERC-20). This means that NFTs can now be composed of multiple components, creating a hierarchy or relationship between them.\nIn simpler terms, ERC-998 allows for the creation of complex digital assets by combining smaller, simpler NFTs and/or ERC-20 tokens.\nThere are two types of composability when it comes to ERC-998 tokens: top-down and bottom-up. Top-down composable tokens own and manage a collection of child tokens, which can be either NFTs or fungible tokens. A good example of this is an in-game character owning various items like weapons and armor as individual NFTs or ERC-20 tokens.\nOn the other hand, bottom-up composable tokens can be attached or linked to a parent NFT. These tokens are often non-transferable and serve as badges of achievement or certifications linked to an NFT representing a profile.\nOne of the significant advantages of ERC-998 is its hierarchical ownership feature. This allows for the creation of complex ownership trees or nested structures of NFTs, providing a more comprehensive representation of digital assets.\nAnother key feature is the ease of transferability for composite tokens. With ERC-998, an entire asset composed of multiple NFTs and ERC-20 tokens can be transferred in a single transaction, simplifying ownership and potential marketplaces.\nMoreover, the atomic transaction feature ensures the integrity and consistency of composite token transfers. This means that either all child tokens will be transferred together with the parent token or none at all, avoiding any discrepancies or issues.\nSource: Depositphotos\nThe potential use cases for ERC-998 are vast and diverse. Here are just a few examples of how this standard can transform different industries:\nIn the gaming industry, ERC-998 allows for complex in-game assets to be represented as top-down composable NFTs composed of items and attributes. This not only simplifies ownership but also facilitates in-game asset management and trading.\nCollections of NFTs can be bundled as a single ERC-998 token, making ownership and potential marketplaces more convenient for digital collectibles.\nERC-998 tokens have the potential to transform real-world asset representation on the blockchain. For example, real estate ownership could potentially be fractionalized and represented by ERC-998 tokens, allowing for easier ownership transfers and investment opportunities.\nBadges, certifications, and other non-transferable achievements can be linked to an identity NFT using bottom-up composable tokens. This provides a secure and verifiable way to showcase one‚Äôs achievements or credentials.\nERC-998 offers several advantages, such as increased versatility and ease of managing composite assets. It also opens up the possibility for novel use cases in various industries. However, it is still an evolving standard with potential changes and limitations, including gas costs and lack of support from some NFT marketplaces and wallets.\nIn conclusion, ERC-998 has the potential to transform NFT use cases by enabling the management and transfer of composite assets. Its hierarchical ownership and composability features open up new possibilities in gaming, digital art, real-world asset representation, and identity verification. While there are still limitations and potential for changes with this evolving standard, it is an exciting development that encourages experimentation and innovation in the world of NFTs.\nFeatured Image: Depositphotos\nWeb3 advocate with a knack for breaking down complex concepts into engaging narratives.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

Could we be on the cusp of a bull run in this exciting new space?","title":"Could Q2 Ignite the Next Blockchain Gaming Bull Run?","content":" Blockchain gaming, a relatively new concept that combines blockchain technology and traditional video games, has been steadily gaining traction in recent years. With the ability for players to truly own their in-game assets and potentially earn real-world value from them, it‚Äôs no wonder that this industry is on the rise. However, despite its potential for success, blockchain gaming still faces challenges when it comes to gaining wider acceptance. But with the end of Q2 fast approaching, could this be the catalyst for a bullish explosion in the world of blockchain gaming?\nAs we enter the second quarter of 2021, there are several notable developments on the horizon that could potentially drive significant growth in the blockchain gaming industry. From highly-anticipated game launches to major infrastructure upgrades and potential partnerships with traditional gaming giants, the stars seem to be aligning for a major uptick in this space.\nLet‚Äôs first take a look at the launch factor. Late Q2 is expected to see some of the most highly-anticipated blockchain game releases yet, including Illuvium‚Äôs The Overworld component, Guild of Guardians, and potentially Big Time. Each of these games brings something unique to the table ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs innovative gameplay, a strong IP, or established developer backing. With these high-profile releases, we could see an influx of new players and investors into the blockchain gaming market, expanding its reach and potential for growth.\nBut it‚Äôs not just about the games themselves. Beyond these exciting releases, there are also significant infrastructure upgrades in the works for Q2. These improvements in scalability, user experience, and security have the potential to remove major barriers to mainstream adoption of blockchain gaming. As more people are able to easily onboard onto blockchain gaming platforms, we could see a significant increase in the player base and overall market size.\nSource: Depositphotos\nAnother factor that could contribute to a bullish explosion in blockchain gaming is the lure of legitimacy. There have been hints of potential partnerships between major gaming studios and blockchain projects, set to be announced in Q2. If these materialize, it could bring validation and wider publicity for the industry as a whole. This could also shift mainstream perception about the potential of blockchain gaming, solidifying its position as a legitimate player in the world of gaming.\nAnd let‚Äôs not forget about the macro effect. As we‚Äôve seen in the past, developments in the cryptocurrency market can have a significant impact on other sectors within the blockchain ecosystem. With Q2 potentially bringing a resurgence in crypto, this could fuel renewed interest and investment in blockchain-based gaming. The interconnected nature of the crypto world means that positive sentiment can often spill over into other areas ‚Äì including blockchain gaming.\nIn conclusion, the end of Q2 could be a significant inflection point for blockchain gaming. With major game launches, infrastructure upgrades, potential partnerships, and overall positive market trends, the stars seem to be aligning for notable growth in this industry. While it‚Äôs still early days for blockchain gaming, the opportunities presented by these developments are hard to ignore. So let‚Äôs keep an eye on the space and see what exciting developments Q2 has in store for us. Who knows, we may just witness a bullish explosion in the world of blockchain gaming. So, it‚Äôs worth keeping a close watch on this industry as it continues to evolve and transform the gaming world.\nVeteran gamer with a deep-seated interest in the evolving NFT and Web3 space.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

Portal, a popular gaming platform, recently made headlines when it successfully launched its token through an airdrop farming campaign. Now, following in Portal‚Äôs footsteps, BlockGames is launching its own BLOCK token using a similar strategy.\nAirdrops refer to the distribution of free tokens or coins to a large number of individuals. This method is often used as a marketing strategy to attract users and create buzz around a new token or platform. Airdrop farming campaigns take this one step further by incentivizing individuals to actively promote the platform in order to earn more tokens.\nüü™ $BLOCK Farming is live! A unique SocialFi experience that can grant you points by tweeting, retweeting, quoting, replying, and liking your peer $BLOCK posts! But don‚Äôt forget to login using our app, link your account, and include the $BLOCK or @GetBlockGames tag to be‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/G7W8AEBp65\nBlockGames, a mobile-centric crypto gaming platform, recently announced its plans to launch its own token, BLOCK, through an airdrop farming campaign. The campaign kicked off on a Friday with the goal of encouraging individuals to promote the platform extensively on social media. The focus was specifically on Twitter, where participants were asked to engage with the platform by tweeting and using specific tags or hashtags.\nTo make the airdrop farming campaign more engaging and rewarding for users, BlockGames introduced a SocialFi experience. This feature rewards users for connecting their Twitter accounts to the BlockGames mobile app and tweeting about the platform. The more active and engaged a user is, the more points they earn. These points will then be converted into BLOCK tokens once the token launches and the airdrop begins.\nThe announcement of BlockGames‚Äô airdrop farming campaign quickly gained traction on social media. The tweet received millions of views and tens of thousands of interactions, showcasing the massive interest and engagement from the community.\nBlockGames‚Äô airdrop farming campaign mirrors the strategy employed by Portal during its successful launch of the PORTAL token. Like BLOCK, PORTAL was also launched through an airdrop farming campaign and saw a peak market cap of over $561 million on its first day. Additionally, Binance Launchpool offered rewards for customers who staked their crypto in support of the launch, resulting in over $9 billion worth of stakes.\nAs more and more platforms and tokens utilize airdrop farming campaigns, the impact on the crypto gaming industry remains to be seen. With BLOCK set to launch through this strategy, it will be interesting to see how it compares to Portal‚Äôs success and if it will have a similar impact on Crypto Twitter discussions. One thing is for sure, airdrop farming campaigns are here to stay and could potentially transform the way new tokens and platforms are launched in the future.\nIn conclusion, BlockGames‚Äô aggressive airdrop farming campaign for its BLOCK token has generated significant interest and engagement from the community, following in the footsteps of Portal‚Äôs successful launch of the PORTAL token. With the rise of airdrop farming campaigns, we can expect to see more innovative strategies being employed in the crypto gaming industry.\nVeteran gamer with a deep-seated interest in the evolving NFT and Web3 space.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

VeVe‚Äôs platform will host the collection, offering fans a new way to engage with the group.\nThis move follows a trend in the K-pop industry, where artists are increasingly leveraging NFTs to connect with their audiences.\nIn October 2022, the K-pop group Aespa collaborated with artist Blake Kathryn to release a collection of NFTs called ‚Äú√¶ girls.‚Äù This collection featured digital artwork, exclusive content, and even included a chance for fans to meet the group in Seoul.\nIn 2023, South Korean internet giant Naver and LINE NEXT launched NOW.Drops, a platform dedicated to offering K-pop NFTs.

In fact, casual mobile games are now the cornerstone of the industry.","title":"Relaxed Fit: Best NFT & Traditional Mobile Games for Casual Players","content":" If you have a smartphone, then you have all the equipment you need to start gaming. In fact, casual mobile games are now the cornerstone of the industry. Though most people think that major eSports and game streaming platforms represent the bulk of the gaming world, think again.\nOver the last decade, it‚Äôs not the rise of competitive gaming leagues and teams that have spread the zeitgeist. Instead, the reason more people are gaming now is because they have access to smartphones, more powerful mobile networks, and more beginner-friendly games than ever before. Though some gamers are certainly competing at a high level, the vast majority just want to relax and pass the time.\nIf you‚Äôre new to gaming and aren‚Äôt sure where to get started, don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôve got a list of suggestions that are suitable for newcomers, including some of the most highly rated NFT P2E mobile games on the market. Best of all, every title listed below can be downloaded straight to your Android or Apple device‚Äîor a tablet, assuming you prefer a larger screen.\nIn terms of casino gaming, the most-played titles in the world are slots. We recommend diving in with Rich Wild & the Book of Dead first. To play, simply spin the reel and wait for winning combinations and bonus rounds to unlock. You‚Äôll be taken on a daring adventure deep into a crypt that houses a dangerous book‚Äîthe Book of Dead. Rich Wilde is a hero on par with others like Indiana Jones, which means you‚Äôll take part in a thrilling adventure with each spin.\nThis wouldn‚Äôt be a list of the best mobile games without a mention of the NFT-based, P2E Axie Infinity. If you remember the magic of NeoPets, then you‚Äôve got the basic idea of this game. Players start with a few monsters (known as Axies), which they can breed, train, and battle against other Axies. There‚Äôs plenty of customization available, along with two competition modes: PvE and PvP. Battles help players earn AXS and SLP, which can both be used in the Axie Marketplace.\nThis short and sweet game takes players into the life of a mysterious character. Players must help her unpack as she leaves her home and attends university, then gets her first job‚Äîon and on. The puzzle has very straightforward mechanics, making it easy for anyone to play. But the unique and intriguing storyline is also worth exploring. It asks the question, Can you know somebody based solely on what they pack to move and where they end up?\nThis NFT game is focused more squarely on helping players earn rewards, especially via passive gaming. The goal is for players to collect powerful characters and create an arena for them to compete in. From there, players will take down some of the biggest villains from Roman, Greek, Indian, Egyptian, Chinese, and Japanese mythology. Similar to Axie Infinity, the marketplace in EpicHero is fully sustainable, meaning you‚Äôll probably see this game grow in popularity over the next few years.\nIf you‚Äôve dabbled in gaming before, then you‚Äôve probably heard of Stardew Valley. This hit game is one of the most widely played around the world. Straight from your smartphone, you can dive into this unique adventure sim. After starting with the task of fixing up a rundown farm, you‚Äôll have plenty of options in terms of how to spend your time in this virtual village. You can farm, fish, take on side quests, or simply mingle with other virtual locals.\nPhoto by Kampus Production\nThis abstract and artsy game challenges players to create mosaics that are based on colored gradients. Though it might sound too straightforward or casual, the goal here is pure relaxation. There are no time restraints or movement restraints, allowing you to tinker with each mosaic piece as long as you need. This game is ideal for those with little or no experience playing any type of video game‚Äîall you need to do to play is drag and drop colorful tiles around a board.\nSimilar to EpicHero, the NFT game Forest Knight places a strong emphasis on fantasy themes and includes a fully-fledged in-game economy. To get started, all you have to do is start exploring the vast map like in a regular RPG‚Äîyou‚Äôll encounter your first mission shortly after. From there, you can start leveling up, creating a team of powerful knights, and even building your own city. Every challenge and encounter provides you with an NFT to add to your collection‚Äîassuming you win, of course.\nThis puzzle game offers a unique twist on gridded play. To advance to the next level, players must create large chains by cobbling together mechanical gears. The setup and grid do take a little time to learn, but those with inquisitive and logical minds will love the challenge. On top of that, the game has kitschy and memorable graphics along with a cute-horror theme that can‚Äôt be found elsewhere.\nProject Makeover is a social and fashion simulation. These types of simulation games allow players to step into the shoes of a character and decide how they navigate all types of situations. In this game, fashion is the focus. Players must figure out what their unique style is, then help others glam up their lives, outfits, makeup looks, and even outlooks on life. If you‚Äôve gravitated toward shows like Keeping Up with the Kardashians or Queer Eye, then you‚Äôll love this title.\nAt its most basic, Upland is a P2E NFT game that includes a marketplace where you can trade your UPX coins and NFTs. There‚Äôs even a fiat exchange hosted by Linden Labs that lets players trade in their crypto for USD. But that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to unique features. This game includes a virtual board game setup that closely mirrors Monopoly. Rather than New York City addresses, players will buy, trade, and take control of real-world locations.\nMain Image Credit\nSkilled Web3 analyst with a focus on the functional and ethical dimensions of decentralized networks.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

These innovations are set to form the foundation of a new blockchain economy, emphasizing the value created by users.\nSupporting six blockchain networks and three wallets via the omnichain network, ‚ÄúNIGHT CROWS‚Äù ensures a wide-reaching and inclusive platform for players. Through Wemade‚Äôs support for networks like WEMIX3.0, Avalanche, BNB, Ethereum, Kroma, and Polygon, along with compatibility with una Wallet, WEMIX Wallet, and PLAY Wallet.\nThe excitement surrounding the NIGHT CROWS‚Äô download was further amplified by the success of the NFT collection ‚ÄúThe Night is Coming,‚Äù launched in January to commemorate the game‚Äôs global pre-registration.

{"url":"https://nftnewstoday.com/2024/03/08/sony-explores-new-gaming-horizon-with-super-fungible-tokens/","web_url":"https://nftnewstoday.com/","type":"article","description":"Sony explores super-fungible tokens (SFTs) in a patent application, hinting at a new era in gaming with cross-title asset transfers.","title":"Sony Explores New Gaming Horizon with 'Super-Fungible Tokens'","content":" Sony could be venturing into uncharted territory with a patent application, which hints at the development of super-fungible tokens. This innovative application, published on February 29th, 2024, could represent a shift in the gaming industry‚Äôs approach to digital assets, potentially altering how players own and engage with game content.\nAt the core of Sony‚Äôs patent is the concept of super-fungible tokens, designed to transform in-game transactions and interactions. According to the patent details, these tokens could enable players to purchase and even transfer game assets across different games. The patent describes a super-fungible token as a unified package comprising several non-fungible tokens. Attached to these NFTs are diverse gaming assets.\nSpecific currencies and limited transferability typically constrain traditional in-game purchases. According to the patent, Sony is developing a method and electronic device for super-fungible tokens for the gaming industry. This system would enable the tracking of gaming assets tied to a player within a game.\nThe patent outlines a process that collects metadata from gaming assets to create a super-fungible token, which is then recorded on a distributed ledger associated with the gaming application, indicating the player‚Äôs ownership of a specific gaming asset at that time. The patent application suggests, ‚ÄúBy way of example, and not limitation, the distributed ledger may be an Ethereum blockchain which may use accounts as state objects and a state of each account can be tracked by the Ethereum blockchain.‚Äù\nWhen a player selects a gaming asset, the system recognizes this choice, activates the selected asset, and simultaneously disables a group of other gaming assets within the application. These disabled assets are specifically those that are not the chosen active asset. This approach suggests a model that manages the ownership and active status of gaming assets, enhancing gaming experiences by allowing the transfer or use of assets across different game titles.\nAssets mentioned in the patent application are, ‚Äúa set of gaming assets (e.g., a weapon, a gaming tool, or an avatar) associated with a player in a gaming application (e.g., an athletic gaming application, a sports gaming application, or a fighting gaming application).‚Äù\nSony‚Äôs concept could revolutionize in-game transactions, making them more versatile. Moreover, it offers a system where gamers could have more control over their in-game assets, opening up new ways to interact within digital gaming ecosystems.\nThis concept aligns with efforts by other gaming companies, like Ubisoft, to explore the integration of NFTs into their ecosystems. Furthermore, Sony‚Äôs super-fungible tokens, with metadata enabling the recognition of connected gaming assets, could enable exchanges between players, introducing new ownership dimensions of gameplay items.\nIn an era where digital transactions dominate the gaming landscape, super-fungible tokens propose a fresh mode of player engagement. Also, this is not Sony‚Äôs first NFT patent application, and Sony‚Äôs forward-thinking strategy could allow for the exchange and gifting of bundled assets. Overall, this innovation could heighten player involvement and attract new participants to gaming, capitalizing on the popular gifting features seen in games like Fortnite.\nNFT market analyst with a sharp eye for trends shaping the NFT sector.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

This move aims to simplify the development process for blockchain-based games and apps by providing direct access to WAX‚Äôs Web3 networks through the AWS console.\nThe integration with AMB allows developers to deploy WAX blockchain nodes directly from the AWS console, eliminating the need for specialized infrastructure. This facilitates the development on both the WAX mainnet and testnet, making it easier for developers to experiment and innovate within the gaming sector.\nThe collaboration between Amazon Web Services and WAX is focused on providing developers with the tools needed to advance in the Web3 gaming space, expected to lead to the creation of new, reliable, and high-performing gaming experiences.\n‚ÄúThe new partnership between WAX and Amazon Web Services is a major next step on our journey to the mass adoption of Web3, enabling both blockchain-native and traditional Web2 developers alike to start building their applications on the WAX blockchain or implement decentralized features into their existing projects with ease,‚Äù said Lukas Sliwka, CTO at WAX, in a statement.\nA big advantage of this partnership is improving the performance and reliability of gaming transactions. WAX‚Äôs blockchain offers fast transaction speeds and 500-millisecond block finality, ensuring secure and almost immediate gaming interactions.\nWith this collaboration, two types of WAX Blockchain nodes are available on AWS: the API Node and the Ship Node. The API Node supports real-time interactions and transaction facilitation. At the same time, the Ship Node provides access to the blockchain‚Äôs history for extensive data queries. Designers have made both consistent and scalable operations, allowing projects to effectively utilize the blockchain‚Äôs capabilities.\nThis partnership between WAX and AWS reflects WAX‚Äôs commitment to enhancing e-commerce and digital interactions through blockchain technology. By leveraging AWS‚Äôs digital infrastructure, accessing and using WAX‚Äôs blockchain capabilities has become simpler for developers, paving the way for future blockchain-based gaming innovations.\nNFT market analyst with a sharp eye for trends shaping the NFT sector.\nView all posts\nThe information provided on this blog is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.
