Lens too.\n2x points if you used a non-warpcast client at least once.\nNever lose sight of the ultimate goal: to build a free and open internet that is also trustworthy.\nCan't do that with theory and larping, need to actually use the tech. pic.twitter.com/RlVXMH0S2S\n‚Äî vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 16, 2024\n\nIn his response, Buterin emphasized the value of definite optimism, specifically in relation to platforms like ‚Äúcrypto farcaster‚Äù and ‚ÄúLens.‚Äù These platforms aim to achieve a decentralized and open internet, a goal that Buterin strongly supports.\nButerin communicated that the primary objective of the cryptocurrency movement is to establish an internet that is unrestricted and accessible to all. He advised against focusing solely on theoretical discussions and emphasized the importance of applying blockchain technology practically. Blockchain has already been utilized as a tool for decentralization in various digital sectors.\nHowever, Ethereum has recently faced some performance issues. Although Bitcoin has achieved new all-time highs, Ethereum has not surpassed its previous highest price. Currently, it is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization but has experienced volatility and market resistance.\nThis situation underscores Buterin‚Äôs point about the necessity for ongoing innovation and the development of practical applications to propel the ecosystem forward. Buterin‚Äôs remarks serve as a directive for developers to enhance their efforts in creating useful applications that address user needs.\nButerin‚Äôs discussion on X highlights the need for the Ethereum community to pursue both philosophical and practical advancements. As Ethereum deals with market fluctuations, maintaining a focus on leveraging its technological infrastructure to support a more open and decentralized internet.\nThis effort is consistent with the core principles of the cryptocurrency movement and emphasizes the importance of development that leads to practical and effective real-world applications.\n","create_date":"2024-05-17T23:54:27+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

The pilot involved U.S. banks such as JPMorgan and BNY Mellon, and focused on integrating net asset value (NAV) data from various funds onto blockchain platforms using Chainlink‚Äôs Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).\nThe initiative, termed the Smart NAV Pilot, was designed to standardize the method of disseminating NAV data across blockchains. The DTCC‚Äôs report from May 16 indicated that the pilot successfully delivered structured data on-chain and established standard roles and processes. These developments are expected to facilitate the creation of tokenized funds and smart contracts that manage data for multiple funds.\nWe‚Äôre excited to share the results of a new Smart NAV industry pilot between @The_DTCC, Chainlink, and 10 of the world‚Äôs largest financial institutions that delivered key mutual fund data onchain.\nFull report: https://t.co/ob3K0s4g86\nThe significance for fund tokenization üßµ pic.twitter.com/74zocXa2s0\n‚Äî Chainlink (@chainlink) May 16, 2024\n\nThe DTCC report further noted that the pilot program improved automated data management and had minimal impact on the existing market practices of traditional financial institutions. It also enabled easier access to historical data and provided broader API solutions for price data, improving efficiency.\nThe pilot demonstrated how DTCC and Chainlink can make net asset value (NAV) data available across virtually any private/public blockchain.\nThis enables automated data dissemination and historical data access, which unlocks a multitude of use cases around fund tokenization. pic.twitter.com/oi4yRxNhSb\n‚Äî Chainlink (@chainlink) May 16, 2024\n\n‚Äúfound that by delivering structured data on-chain and creating standard roles and processes, foundational data could be embedded into a multitude of on-chain use cases, such as tokenized funds and ‚Äòbulk consumer‚Äô smart contracts, which are contracts that hold data for multiple funds,‚Äù the report reads.\nParticipating in the pilot were several U.S. banking and investment firms, including American Century Investments, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street, and U.S. Bank. This diverse participation underscores the interest in and feasibility of applying blockchain technology within conventional financial operations.\n\nThe pilot‚Äôs completion coincides with a broader trend towards the acceptance of real-world asset tokenization within the traditional financial sector. Notably, BlackRock launched a tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum network in March, named BUIDL.\nThis fund issues tokens representing shares that invest in stable assets like U.S. Treasury bills, aligning traditional investment practices with modern blockchain technology. The success of such initiatives indicates potential future expansions in blockchain applications within finance, streamlining processes and enhancing the accessibility of financial data.\n","create_date":"2024-05-17T01:47:04+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

The court found Pertsev guilty of laundering approximately $1.2 billion in cryptocurrency between July 9, 2019, and August 10, 2022.\nThe conviction comes amid heightened scrutiny of cryptocurrency platforms and their roles in financial transactions. Tornado Cash, known for its ability to obscure the origin of cryptocurrency funds, has been a focal point in discussions about the balance between privacy and legality in digital finance.\nRelated: Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Receives Light Prison Sentence\nDuring the trial, a panel of three judges declared that Tornado Cash was primarily used as a tool for criminal activities. The judges emphasized that Pertsev, as a developer, should have been more vigilant about the potential misuse of the technology. According to reports, one judge remarked that the nature and functioning of Tornado Cash clearly catered to a criminal agenda.\nPertsev, a 31-year-old Russian national, now has a two-week window to appeal the decision through his legal team. However, as of now, his representatives have not responded to requests for comment.\nThe case has attracted significant attention, particularly among financial privacy advocates who argue that Pertsev is being unfairly penalized for creating an open-source software. These advocates maintain that the developer did not have direct control over how individuals used the platform to conceal their transaction histories on the public blockchain.\nRead More: Sam Bankman-Fried appeals $8 billion FTX fraud conviction, questioning trial fairness. Legal battle looms.\nProsecutors, however, successfully argued that Pertsev did not take adequate measures to prevent Tornado Cash from being exploited for money laundering purposes. They contended that the decentralized nature of the platform does not absolve the developer of responsibility for its uses.\nAs the legal market continues to evolve, the Pertsev case serves as a critical reminder to the crypto community about the legal responsibilities and potential risks associated with the development and management of privacy-focused technologies. The industry watches closely as Pertsev‚Äôs co-founder, Roman Storm, faces similar charges in the U.S., with his trial set for September in a federal court in New York.\n","create_date":"2024-05-14T14:12:45+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

In view of recent adjustments to the BTC mining hashrate‚Äîa metric of the overall processing power required to mine Bitcoin‚Äîthis correction is necessary.\nThis change, according to claim analysts under the direction of Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, is a reflection of the changing dynamics of the mining industry.\nWhen the Bitcoin network was halved, JPMorgan first expected a sharp decline in hashrate as less productive and efficient miners would be driven off.\nThough slowly, this process seems to be developing. Based on the current hashrate and power usage, JPMorgan has updated their central estimate of the cost of producing Bitcoin to about $45,000, which is far less than the current market values of about $65,000.\nJPMorgan analysts calculated in February that it would cost $42,000 to create one Bitcoin. This number served as a price objective for Bitcoin as well, expected to be hit after the post-halving frenzy died down.\nAt the time of writing, CoinMarketCap has Bitcoin valued at about $65,592.37. After a little 0.21% drop in the last 24 hours, this price is still in a good position, having risen 4.69% in the last week.\nPanigirtzoglou stressed that JPMorgan still views $42,000 as the medium-term price level, even with the new production cost estimate of $45,000.\nHe clarified that the hashrate and the mining equipment efficiency‚Äîboth of which are changing after the halving‚Äîhave an impact on the projected production costs. Accordingly, when these variables develop, the $45,000 estimate that is now in place may vary.\n‚ÄúThe hashrate and mining equipment efficiency are in a state of flux post-halving,‚Äù Panigirtzoglou said to The Block. As the hash rate and equipment efficiency change over time, ‚Äúwe get a $45,000 estimate at the moment, but this figure might shift.‚Äù\nPanigirtzoglou restated that, after hashrate and mining efficiency stabilise, the medium-term production cost goal is $42,000. He said that this stability would take some time and that the volatility in these measurements right now is transient.\nFollowing reports from ETHNews, the introduction of the Bitcoin Runes protocol caused a brief increase in Bitcoin transaction costs following the halving event. This increased, but, turned out to be fleeting.\nThe research pointed out a sharp fall in Runes protocol user activity and fees within the last week or two, underscoring the continuous difficulties Bitcoin miners have in sustaining profitable revenue streams, especially in the post-halving climate.\nOutpacing the hashrate dip, power usage on the Bitcoin network decreased noticeably as interest in the Runes protocol declined. This suggests that, a logical result of declining Bitcoin values, unprofitable miners with less effective setups are leaving the network.\nThis flight, claim the analysts, is a component of a normal feedback loop related to Bitcoin pricing. The hashrate and production cost are further reduced when prices drop since more unprofitable miners quit the network.\nThe analysts of JPMorgan warned that a number of obstacles have limited the price of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential increase. These include a meager demand for Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong and little inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n","create_date":"2024-05-17T10:00:55+00:00","tag":"","author":"Syofri"},

Meanwhile, BNB may have gained 1.3% in a week, but it‚Äôs still in the recovery phase as both coins seek price stability.\nOn the other hand, experts highlight Milei Moneda ($MEDA) as the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Investors can enjoy various benefits, including 100% ROI, a 0% tax rate, voting rights, and more. Let‚Äôs explore more!\nEconomize Like Milei: Invest in $MEDA!\nAlthough Ethereum is a top crypto to buy, its price is currently hanging precariously above the $2900 region and is set to close the week with a 6% dip in price. On-chain metrics have revealed the important catalysts surrounding the underwhelming performance of ETH.\nOn a positive note, the global market started in May 2024 as investors piled on capital inflows, hitting $150 billion within the first week. However, this market rally has tapered off since May 7, with bears crawling back most of the gains seen in the first week of May.\nNotably, this current bearish pressure surrounding Ethereum seems more intense than the broader market average. The underwhelming performance in ETH price can be attributed to the multiple delays and negative sentiment surrounding Ethereum ETF approval prospects in the United States.\nThis week, news emerged that the US‚Äô largest Digital Assets Manager, Grayscale, had withdrawn its Ethereum ETF application. This has cast further doubts on the possibility of an approval in 2024. Investors‚Äô negative reaction to this development might have resulted in the current downtrend in the ETH price.\nThe past month has been a rollercoaster for many crypto coins as most struggled to hold on to a positive price action despite the anticipated bull run associated with the Bitcoin halving event.\nMeanwhile, BNB holds a position in the crypto space as one of the top crypto coins. For the past month, it has been on a recovery route for most of the time, registering a 1.3% rise in value over the past week.\nHowever, Binance Coin‚Äôs price is still down 1% on the monthly chart, suggesting that BNB is still in the recovery phase. If the bulls gather momentum, BNB‚Äôs next target resistance could be $635, followed by the $692 level. However, if the bears take control, support levels of $536 and $495 might come into play.\nDespite the short-term fluctuations of BNB‚Äôs price, its overall trajectory is optimistic, buoyed by the broader crypto market sentiment and its robust fundamentals.\nMilei Moneda is a unique meme coin project that seeks to transform the crypto space through its innovative approaches and distinguishing features. Crypto enthusiasts and analysts have spotlighted Milei Moneda, emphasizing its substantial return potential and growing community.\n$MEDA is the native token of the Milei Moneda ecosystem. It is a deflationary token whose value keeps increasing as its overall supply declines over time. With a total supply of 500 million tokens, Milei Moneda allocates 60% to the public, 5% to burn, another 5% to airdrop, 15% to marketing & rewards, and 15% to liquidity.\nHolders of $MEDA benefit from some exclusive offers like NFT staking rewards, voting rights, and discounts. With these incredible perks, $MEDA is the best crypto for beginners.\nAs Milei Moneda prepares to launch on Uniswap on May 21, 2024, its steady value growth and outstanding features promise enticing opportunities for investors. Milei Moneda‚Äôs high growth potential underscores its robust market presence, making it the best crypto to invest in. In Stage 3 of its presale, Milei Moneda offers its token at $0.015, marking 33.3% ROI for new investors when it launches at $0.020.\nGot $MEDA curiosity?

The quick progress, in the meantime, can result in ‚Äúdata silos‚Äù‚Äîsystems that are unable to talk to one another.\nYang underlined that there is a fragmentation problem that results in data silos because of the major variations in the technical paths and standards, including protocols, among economies. He added:\n‚ÄúEleven countries have fully launched their CBDCs to date; others are in later stages of development.‚Äù\nChina has implemented its digital yuan in a number of apps, while the European Central Bank is getting ready to launch a digital Euro. Commercial banks in India process a million digital rupee transactions per day.\nIn July 2023, Swift opened the second stage of its CBDC sandbox, which concentrated on intricate use cases in digital assets, digital trade, and foreign exchange networks for CBDC payments and settlements.\nDuring the six-month research, 38 financial institutions from around the world‚Äîincluding regulators, commercial banks, and market infrastructures‚Äîapplied seven distinct CBDCs.\nYang underlined that the utilization of CBDCs across borders depends critically on interoperability. The sandbox results validated SWIFT‚Äôs suggestion to streamline digital transactions while enabling financial institutions to keep using their current infrastructures.\nTechnically, trade payment automation has been demonstrated via tests on the interaction between digital trade platforms and CBDC networks using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts.\nSwift intends to develop its CBDC connector solution to test larger use cases in a more complete setting. Addressing rising market demands includes improving support for cross-border payments and on-chain FX settlements.\nMeanwhile, an ETHNews report that said bitcoin is regarded as property in China added yet another level of complexity to the world of digital currencies.\nAs such, legislation that forbids property crimes and judicial assessment applies to cryptocurrency holdings.

This aims to enhance the rebalancing of pools through decentralized finance (DeFi) technology, providing a more efficient and secure trading environment.\n.@flashliquidity has integrated #Chainlink Data Streams and Automation on @arbitrum to help power onchain rebalancing operations in self-balancing pools.\nWhy Flash Liquidity chose the industry-standard low-latency oracle solutionüëáhttps://t.co/Vo0zOXJwFx\n‚Äî Chainlink (@chainlink) May 14, 2024\n\nBy adopting Chainlink‚Äôs oracle solutions, Flash Liquidity gains access to real-time, low-latency price data, allowing for precise onchain rebalancing operations. The initial phase of this integration utilizes Chainlink Data Streams for ETH/USD and USDC/USD, selected for their reliable and timely data delivery.\nSelf-balancing pools, unique to Flash Liquidity, are designed to maintain the balance of asset value ratios within the pool. These pools do not open to public trading, thus offering a distinct setup compared to typical liquidity pools. When an imbalance is detected, the system swiftly calculates the necessary size and direction for a rebalancing trade. It then selects an appropriate decentralized exchange to execute the transaction, enhancing efficiency and security.\nThe integration of Chainlink Data Streams is particularly crucial for protecting against market anomalies such as exchange downtimes, flash crashes, and potential manipulations through flash loans. These features underscore the resilience and reliability of Chainlink‚Äôs infrastructure, which is critical in maintaining the integrity and performance of Flash Liquidity‚Äôs operations.\nChainlink‚Äôs decentralized execution capabilities are pivotal, as they ensure that transactions are processed onchain without centralized points of failure. This setup helps safeguard against adverse selection, where a decentralized application (dApp) might otherwise exploit favorable pricing.\nMoreover, Chainlink‚Äôs architecture prevents front-running, protecting users from price manipulation and information arbitrage by employing conflict of interest-free data sources and a secure commit-reveal scheme.\nThe integration‚Äôs success can also be attributed to Chainlink‚Äôs proven track record in the DeFi space, where it has facilitated over 8.5 trillion dollars in onchain transaction volume. This robust performance is backed by a platform known for its security and reliability, factors that have been time-tested in various market conditions.\nAs Flash Liquidity plans to expand its offerings, additional Chainlink Data Streams will be integrated to support a broader range of crypto-asset price data. This expansion will allow for more comprehensive rebalancing operations and enhance the distribution of rewards to liquidity providers.\nDiego Cornacchini, the founder of Flash Liquidity, expressed confidence in their choice of Chainlink, citing its proven security and reliability as key factors in providing a superior service to their users.\n‚ÄúWe chose Chainlink as our oracle solution because of its outstanding record of robust security, hyper-reliability, and high-quality data, proven in production for years.

From an Ethereum developer conference in Kenya, Buterin provided updates on the ongoing development focused on increasing the network‚Äôs accessibility and reducing its dependency on centralized structures.\nAt the conference, Buterin discussed progress on key projects like PeerDAS, Verkle trees, and decentralized history storage with EIP 4444. These technologies are intended to increase network capacity and reduce energy use. Buterin noted the rapid development within Ethereum and the implementation of features that benefit users on both the primary network (Layer 1) and secondary layers (Layer 2).\nA part of Buterin‚Äôs presentation was dedicated to addressing the complexities of Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Originally, Ethereum miners used a basic algorithm for block creation. The introduction of MEV, which involves exploiting specific DeFi protocol operations, has complicated this process.\nButerin outlined two main strategies to mitigate the impact of MEV: minimizing the information available to block producers and quarantining MEV to separate the roles of validators and builders, thus maintaining a level of fairness and decentralization.\nButerin emphasized the importance of facilitating solo staking within the Ethereum ecosystem, which is currently dominated by centralized entities like Lido and RocketPool. He identified the 32 ETH minimum and technical challenges as barriers to entry for individual stakers.\nEfforts are underway to reduce these barriers by decreasing hardware requirements and simplifying the setup process, potentially allowing for smaller minimum staking amounts.\nTechnologies such as Verkle trees and EIP 4444 are central to these efforts. They could significantly reduce the hardware needs for nodes, facilitating faster synchronization and enabling more users to operate nodes independently.\nResearch is also focused on reducing the risks associated with decentralized staking pools through innovations in penalty capping and 0x01 withdrawal credentials.\nButerin also addressed the need to simplify the operation of full nodes, which currently require significant hardware resources. Technologies like EIP 4444 and Verkle trees could minimize these requirements substantially.\nBy reducing the need for extensive historical data storage and implementing zero-knowledge proofs for state verification, Ethereum aims to allow node operation on devices with lower processing power, such as consumer laptops and mobile phones.\nIn addressing the potential risk of centralization from reducing node operation demands, Buterin proposed a decentralized peer-to-peer network for storing historical data. This network would ensure no single party controls this critical information, maintaining the decentralized ethos of the network while easing the operational load on individual nodes.\nThrough these initiatives, Buterin aims to enhance Ethereum‚Äôs infrastructure, making it more robust and accessible for a broader range of participants.\n","create_date":"2024-05-17T20:43:46+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

A bullish attitude and a lack of demand are the main contributors to this tendency.\nCardano has been mired between $0.43 and $0.47, while Bitcoin has found it difficult to escape the $60.8k‚Äì$63.3k area. Reiterating the gloomy assumptions, on-chain measures show no indication of a positive breakout for Cardano.\nAs of writing, ADA was trading at about $0.4338, down 1.70% in the previous day and 3.18% over the previous week, according to CoinMarketCap.\nLong-term investors should be pleased with high development activity since it shows that the project is always resolving problems and getting ready to release new features.\nTo improve peer-sharing capabilities and get itself ready for upgrades following the Conway era shift, Cardano has released node v.8.9.2, as previously reported by ETHNews.\nThough development activity has been robust, since mid-March, other indicators like daily active addresses and social traffic have been falling.\nSocial media interactions have decreased and daily active addresses show that fewer people are using the network for transactions. Furthermore, for the majority of the last six weeks, the Weighted Sentiment has been down.\nThough it does not always mean a quick decline, this negative or bearish internet activity does not look good for the short-term price prospects.\nSince mid-March, the 30-day MVRV ratio has been negative, indicating an acutely undervalued asset. This undervaluation hasn‚Äôt changed the unfavorable price trend. Ongoing accumulation is indicated, nonetheless, by the fast rising mean coin age. Swing traders had a nice chance to purchase as ADA approached the range bottom.\nThe Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio, which is based on daily circulation, has also been trending higher since mid-March.\nThis implies that, given its poor capacity for token transactions, the network is either overpriced or costly. Bearish consequences follow for network utilization and, hence, future demand.\nCombining technical analysis with these hints, it seems that Cardano is probably going to suffer greater losses. But this downturn might stop or turn around if Bitcoin breaks out.\nStill, there is no bullish evidence at hand. Whale transactions started to rise earlier, indicating possible interest from big investors, when Cardano‚Äôs trading volume reached a yearly low, in line with what ETHNews previously disclosed.\n","create_date":"2024-05-14T13:00:34+00:00","tag":"","author":"Syofri"},

Is it headed for $100K?","title":"Is Bitcoin Headed for $100K? Here's What the Experts Say","content":" Analysts and enthusiasts for cryptocurrency are always talking about forecasting the next big move in Bitcoin. The activities of the US Federal Reserve stand out as one key factor in determining whether Bitcoin can surpass its all-time high of $73,700 later in the year.\nBitcoin has to hit a sustainable all-time high if the U.S. high yield rate falls below 6 or 7%, claims Timothy Peterson, founder of Cane Island Alternative Advisors. In highlighting the significance of interest rate fluctuation in Bitcoin‚Äôs price action, he said:\n‚ÄúThe U.S. high yield rate is a great indicator.‚Äù\nYCharts data shows that as of right now, the U.S. high yield rate‚Äîwhich is the rate of high-yield corporate bonds because of their increased risk of default‚Äîis 7.24%. For analysts like Peterson, who think a decline in this rate could pave the way for Bitcoin‚Äôs next significant price surge, it is an essential indicator.\nAbout the future of Bitcoin, Peterson is upbeat. He projects that by the fourth quarter of 2024, or at the latest, the second quarter of 2025, BTC will hit the much-anticipated $100,000 price tag, assuming yield rates stay within the ‚Äú6 or 7%‚Äù level. The course of interest rate policy by the Federal Reserve will greatly influence this forecast.\nThe high-yield rate usually tends to drop along with interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve. Almost two thirds of analysts think this rate decrease will occur in September of this year, according to a recent Reuters poll.\nLower interest rates typically translate into lower yields for investors in term deposits and bonds, which drives more investors into riskier assets like Bitcoin in search of higher returns.\nFor cryptocurrency traders, interest rates are considered to be an important metric. The lower yield from safe assets like bonds when rates are decreased encourages investors to look for larger returns in riskier assets, such as Bitcoin.\nThis change might have a significant impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics, which could lead to higher investment and price increases.\nGenerally speaking, Peterson says, markets are ‚Äúflat and volatile‚Äù between September and October.\nThough election day is set for November 4, he notes that this isn‚Äôt usually the case and that the approaching U.S. election later this year is expected to heighten uncertainty until October. This political element might have a bigger impact on investor behavior and market volatility.\nOn how Fed rate reductions will affect things, not all analysts concur. Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency expert better known by his stage name ‚ÄúThe Wolf of All Streets,‚Äù asserts that interest rate cuts aren‚Äôt always advantageous for assets other than fixed-income investments.\nEveryone seemingly wants the Fed to cut rates.\nThere is a wildly popular theory that a Fed pivot is good for markets.\nIt is patently FALSE.\nAfter the Fed pivot to rate cuts, the market almost ALWAYS crashes/corrects.\nRate cuts generally precede major dips.\nLet's look at‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Hu1rzghBBM\n‚Äî The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) May 14, 2024\n\nCoinMarketCap reports that the price of BTC at the moment of writing is at $61,902.30, slightly up 0.45% over the previous day. It has, nevertheless, decreased by 0.43% throughout the last seven days. This price swing highlights the level of market volatility right now.\nYesterday, in line with what ETHNews previously disclosed, there were also not insignificant net inflows into U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs, with the Fidelity ETF receiving the largest amount ($38.5731 million).\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T11:00:10+00:00","tag":"","author":"Syofri"},

After winning a legal case against the SEC last year, Grayscale has withdrawn its application for an Ethereum futures product, suggesting a shift away from further legal challenges.\nThe SEC is currently involved in a legal case with Ethereum supporter ConsenSys regarding whether Ethereum should be classified as a security. However, Larry Fink of BlackRock stated that such a classification would not necessarily prevent the launch of an Ether ETF, showing a commitment to adapting to regulatory outcomes.\nAs the SEC reviews these Ethereum ETF applications, the decisions made will influence the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and potentially set precedents for how digital assets are treated in the financial sector.\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T03:27:55+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

He points out that the Spot Bitcoin ETF has been receiving substantial investments from important financial organizations such pension funds, insurance companies, and large hedge funds. This inflow of institutional capital has made Bitcoin a more established asset.\nFurthermore, indicating Bitcoin‚Äôs changing position in the financial world are the CME Group‚Äôs introduction of a futures ETF and the expectation of options-based trading.\nNotwithstanding these encouraging changes, van de Poppe thinks that the four-year cycle‚Äôs simplicity and the effect of Bitcoin halving will eventually fade.\nThe conventional dynamics of the cryptocurrency market will shift as long as institutional investors concentrate on risk management and macroeconomic developments.\nVan de Poppe lists a number of tactics to optimize profits in this bull run. Those consist of:\nTrading Bitcoins is the route van de Poppe has decided upon. Though there are risks involved, he thinks that trading cryptocurrencies inside the Web 3.0 environment has the best possible rewards.\nAn experienced businessman and 2017 survivor of the crypto market, Van de Poppe stresses the value of education and taking calculated risks. According to him, a decentralized ecosystem that works needs resources other than Bitcoin.\nHis choice is supported by the tokenization of Web 2.0 spaces and the declarations of top fund managers that everything will eventually be tokenized.\nMuch liquidity has entered the cryptocurrency market with the recent approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF.\nVan de Poppe does note, meanwhile, that a significant decline in altcoin valuations has resulted from many investors who are native to the cryptocurrency having exchanged their altcoins for Bitcoin.\nRegulating issues make the possible approval of an Ethereum ETF still unclear. More complications for the market are added by the SEC‚Äôs recent letters, which state that the majority of cryptocurrencies are regarded as unregistered securities.\nVan de Poppe, pointing to a number of reasons, is nevertheless upbeat about the future of cryptocurrencies:\nVan de Poppe feels that there is unquestionable potential upside for cryptocurrencies and that they have been overly discounted. In the short run, he is prepared to take possible losses of up to 50‚Äì80% despite the inherent hazards.\nDuring the next six to twelve months, he expects Bitcoin to appreciate by 300‚Äì900%. He projects an extra return of 300‚Äì600% if Bitcoin stabilises, for a possible total return of 900‚Äì4500% throughout the next 12‚Äì24 months.\nIt is a calculated risk for Michael van de Poppe to have sold all of his Bitcoin and invested in other currencies. His approach is motivated by his thorough market knowledge and conviction in the Web 3.0 ecosystem‚Äôs future.\nThough there is a lot of uncertainty ahead, van de Poppe is still sure that there will be significant profits in the next few months and years.\nAccording to CoinGecko data, BTC is now valued at $66,171.47, slightly down 0.12% in the last day but up 4.66% over the previous week.

Over the last two weeks, these investors have acquired more than 110 million XRP tokens, with an approximate value of $55 million. This buying spree is a strong indication of confidence in XRP‚Äôs future, even as Ripple faces ongoing litigation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nMarket data reflects this positive sentiment with XRP‚Äôs price increasing by over 3% in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $0.5174. This price is above the previous resistance level, with a 12.39% increase in trading volume, suggesting a robust interest in the cryptocurrency.\nThe ongoing legal case between Ripple and the SEC remains a critical factor for XRP‚Äôs outlook. Ripple has made moves to potentially influence the perception of the case, such as supporting motions to seal certain documents which discuss discounts given to institutional buyers of XRP.\nInvestors should note several important points:\nThis compilation of expert analysis, whale purchases, and supportive market trends provides a comprehensive outlook on XRP, suggesting that it is a cryptocurrency deserving attention in the forthcoming months.\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T23:58:11+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

Gox Payments Are On the Way","content":" According to a recent Reddit post and an earlier report by Chinese crypto journalist Wu Blockchain, as of May 13, the Mt. Gox payment API interface on Kraken displays a status of ‚Äúpayment in preparation.‚Äù\nAccording to Reddit, MtGox‚Äôs Kraken BTC and BCH payment API interface shows ‚Äúpayment in preparation‚Äù, and the update date is May 13. It is expected that Mt Gox will distribute its holdings of 142,000 BTC, 143,000 BCH and 69 billion yen to creditors before October 31, 2024.‚Ä¶\n‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 14, 2024\n\nThis move implies that the much awaited distribution of Mt. Gox‚Äôs remaining assets is getting close to happening.\nThe notorious cryptocurrency exchange, which was hit hard in 2014, is supposed to provide its creditors access to its 142,000 BTC, 143,000 BCH, and 69 billion yen holdings by October 31, 2024, in line with what ETHNews previously disclosed.\nThe community had previously counselled debtors to temper their expectations about when they would get their money.\nThere was much conjecture that, rather than signaling an impending distribution, the recent adjustments to the payment status may have been done to lessen the number of creditors‚Äô questions.\nBut this latest update seems to suggest that the distribution process is at last proceeding and offers a clearer timetable.\nOnce the biggest Bitcoin exchange globally, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after hackers stole 850,000 BTC. Thousands of creditors were left in uncertainty, and the collapse had a big impact on the cryptocurrency market.\nThe years-long payback delays brought on by numerous legal disputes and administrative barriers have made those affected angry and uncertain.\nThe cryptocurrency market may suffer greatly from the approaching distribution of such a large quantity of BTC and BCH. Market players are speculating on possible effects on pricing and liquidity, with 142,000 BTC and 143,000 BCH scheduled for release.\nAlthough some think that the distribution would put further pressure on sellers, others counter that creditors might decide to hang onto their assets and reduce the immediate market disruptions.\nCreditors are feeling both cautiously optimistic and skeptical. Many creditors are nonetheless cautious about more delays, even if the most recent bulletins have brought some clarity.\nA major turning point in ending one of the longest-running stories in bitcoin history will be reached when the distribution procedure is successfully completed.\nEverybody will be watching Mt. Gox and its officials to see if they can keep their word as the October 31 deadline draws near. The way this distribution turns out will have an impact on the creditors as well as establish a standard for future handling of comparable circumstances.\n","create_date":"2024-05-14T10:00:39+00:00","tag":"","author":"Syofri"},

A recent report highlights Ethereum‚Äôs resilience and growth potential within the volatile digital asset market.\n\nThis year, Ethereum has seen a 29% increase in value, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs impressive 50% surge, aligning with the overall 28% rise observed in the crypto market.\nOne of the most highlighted elements is the reduction in ETH‚Äôs liquid supply, driven primarily by staking and the development of layer 2 solutions.\n\nThese activities have solidified Ethereum‚Äôs role as an essential hub within the DeFi ecosystem, through ongoing adoption and enhancements to the EVM, which is crucial for running smart contracts and DeFi applications.\nEthereum continues to be instrumental in the DeFi ecosystem due to its ability to facilitate the creation and execution of smart contracts. Technical analysts have identified positive patterns that suggest a favorable outlook for Ethereum in the near future.\n\nAdditionally, a recovery from the key support level at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement around $2800, which historically has been a precursor to price rallies in bull markets, has been noted.\nEthereum‚Äôs previous spike above $4000 is seen as an turning point, marking the start of a new long-term uptrend.\nProminent cryptocurrency analysts, like CryptoYoddha, predict that Ethereum could surge past $10,000 by the end of 2024, supported by solid DeFi fundamentals and strong on-chain supply dynamics.\nWith a decision pending on the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by May 23, the cryptocurrency community is speculating about the possibility of an ETH price rebound. Discussions revolve around the current context being similar to previous psychological lows, suggesting it might be an opportune moment to consider investments in Ethereum, especially if Bitcoin demonstrates a positive path in the short term.\nDespite some recent apathy and a downward trend in the ETH/Bitcoin ratio, the expectation of a possible Ethereum ETF approval and the influx of new capital could provide a significant boost to Ethereum‚Äôs value and market position.\nThis context, coupled with a favorable technical outlook and ongoing interest in DeFi solutions, positions Ethereum as an investment option with appreciable potential in the coming months.\n","create_date":"2024-05-17T19:30:35+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

With its momentum surging forward and investors in platforms like Jupiter (JUP) and Polygon (MATIC) anticipate rebounds, investors wonder whether $RECQ is truly a gem poised for exponential growth.\nCome with us as we uncover the truth about this top ICO.\nRebel Satoshi is not your average ICO project; it‚Äôs shaking up the crypto scene with its vision for decentralizing finance. Picture this: two ERC20 coins, $RBLZ, and $RECQ, playing tag team to boost governance and utility on Rebel Satoshi.\nNow, let‚Äôs talk numbers. Rebel Satoshi‚Äôs $RBLZ presale raised a cool $2.5 million in the bank, putting it together with the ERC20 elites. And when $RBLZ hit the likes of Uniswap and CoinStore, early birds were chirping with joy, seeing a sweet 150% return on their investment.\nBut wait, there‚Äôs more. Rebel Satoshi‚Äôs hype train didn‚Äôt stop at $RBLZ. It‚Äôs full steam ahead with $RECQ‚Äôs presale, currently rocking Stage 2 at $0.0044, a solid 18.92% leap from its Stage 1 price of $0.0037. And the Rebel Satoshi party is just getting started; whispers say $RECQ will hit $0.0125 by the end of its presale, registering a 525% ROI from $RECQ‚Äôs $0.0020 Early Bird price.\nMoreover, holding onto $RECQ opens doors to snagging exclusive NFTs and diving into the thrill of the Rebel Satoshi Arcade game. Ultimately, $RECQ is the perfect NFT to buy now.\nJupiter Exchange is a decentralized exchange aggregator platform developed within the Solana ecosystem. In the third week of April 2024, it announced the launch of Metropolis Part 1. This latest update allows users to trade new tokens and markets instantly. Furthermore, it significantly advances how Jupiter manages new JUP tokens, markets, and token lists.\nIn response to this development, Jupiter registered a 6.19% upturn by the second week of May as JUP rose from $0.97 to $1.03. Experts also forecast that this bullish momentum for Jupiter will continue for the rest of the year, with JUP reaching $2.81 by then. If this happens, Jupiter will showcase a 172.81% jump from JUP‚Äôs price of $1.03. Does this make JUP the best crypto to invest in? Perhaps, but let us determine if Polygon‚Äôs MATIC can perform just as well.\n\nhttps://www.rebelsatoshi.com/?utm_source=MCAP&utm_medium=Banner&utm_id=Bird\nThe beginning of April 2024 saw Polygon CEO Marc Boiron spark a discussion opposing the advancement of layer-3 networks, all amidst the booming success of the Degen Chain. Since its launch in March, the Degen Chain network has swiftly captured attention, attracting both fervent supporters and cautious critics.\nIn response to this Polygon MATIC news, MATIC shifted from $0.95 to $0.68 by the second week of May, signifying a 28.42% downturn. Can Polygon recover from the bears? Experts project that MATIC will be trading at $4.90 by Q4 2024, marking a 620.59% ascent from Polygon‚Äôs value of $0.68.\nAs it is, Polygon is not performing as well as Jupiter, but there‚Äôs hope for a MATIC recovery. That said, $RECQ does emerge as the winner compared to the two.\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T17:00:09+00:00","tag":"","author":"John Kiguru"},

Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Binance Coin (BNB) are top altcoins worth buying. However, a new altcoin is leading the way. Rollblock (RBLK) has 50x more potential than other altcoins; that‚Äôs why experts believe it‚Äôs among the best altcoins to invest in 2024. Let me explain.\nRollblock (RBLK) is an upcoming GambleFi protocol that will offer members top gaming entertainment. With the gaming industry suffering from issues such as transparency and trust, Rollblock is coming up with a solution. Rollblock uses blockchain technology to ensure that all transactions are immutable and permanent, making it difficult to alter bets when placed.\nAccessibility is easy because all users need is their email, as no KYC is required. To get started, all a user needs to do is register, deposit a crypto and play games. The native token, RBLK, is the currency that players use in the ecosystem. Users can convert it to other cryptos or fiat. It serves as the primary mechanism for distributing rewards, cash backs and promotional offers.\nRollblock Casino is fully licensed and operational while complying with legal frameworks to ensure players‚Äô security and reach a wider audience globally. The $RBLK is sold for $0.01, and the cheap price point makes it one of the top altcoins to watch in 2024. As the first community-backed crypto casino, users receive up to 30% of the weekly revenue obtained from the platform just by holding the token.\nMeanwhile, the revenue generated from the ecosystem is used to purchase $RBLK from the open market. While 50% of $RBLK tokens bought are burned, the other 50% is used for staking rewards, which will give $RBLK token holders a remarkable APY in the crypto space. Experts say Rollblock has 1000x potential, which makes it one of the best altcoins to invest in 2024.\nSolana (SOL) is among the top 10 altcoins that investors have shown keen interest in recent weeks. Ranked 7th in the altcoin market based on trading volume, Solana is highly sought-after in the market. Its combination of PoH and PoS offers faster transaction processing and cheaper transaction fees, making it a go-to platform for traders.\nMoreover, the Solana price gained 566% in its year-to-date chart based on CoinMarketCap data. With Solana‚Äôs market cap tipped to reach $80B in the coming weeks, the popular altcoin has established itself as a top player in the market. Most of the Solana price predictions tip the price to reach $300 in Q3, making it one of the top altcoins to watch in the coming months.\nAvalanche (AVAX) is one of the altcoins that have captured investors‚Äô interest. Ranked among the top 30 cryptos in the market, Avalanche has witnessed increased trading activity in the past months. This could be seen with the Avalanche market cap hitting $13B with close to $300M daily trading activity.\nAvalanche market sentiment is bullish in the long term and that could trigger a rally soon. Having already tested the $60 mark in March, analysts believe a retest is possible in May. As the market heads into the bull run, some of the Avalanche price predictions are projecting a price value above $100 in Q4.\nBinance Coin (BNB) is the native token of the Binance exchange. Although the exchange has battled regulatory issues in the past few weeks, analysts still believe the Binance Coin is one of the top altcoins. The Binance Coin market sentiment is bullish, with major key market indicators showing buy signals.\nThe Binance trading volume and market cap are surging to signal massive trading activity. Market data shows that BNB is trading above the 50-EMA and 200-EMA. As a result, analysts see a rally to the $800 mark in Q2 based on their Binance price predictions for 2024.\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!\nWebsite: https://presale.rollblock.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/rollblockcasino\n","create_date":"2024-05-14T06:57:10+00:00","tag":"","author":"John Kiguru"},

These wallets have transacted 200 ETH, valued at approximately $600,000, sending the funds to a U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken.\nThe story traces back to nine years ago when an address identified as ‚Äú0x5eD‚Äù first transferred funds to Buterin‚Äôs wallets.

The price of Ethereum has risen nearly 6% in today‚Äôs trading session, hitting a peak of $3,110 over the last week and a half. This rally nearly reverses the downturn observed in the preceding nine days.\nThis flurry of activity comes just as the crypto community is on edge with the pending decision on an Ethereum spot ETF, the first of its kind for altcoins, expected in less than a week. The reasons behind these ancient wallets becoming active at a time when Ethereum‚Äôs price is climbing, and right before a critical ETF decision, raises questions within the crypto sector.\nThe precise motives for moving these funds at such a critical juncture remain unclear, but the timing is undoubtedly striking. The reactivation of these long-dormant wallets and their transactions are closely watched by market analysts and participants, who are eager to understand the implications of these moves on Ethereum‚Äôs market.\n","create_date":"2024-05-17T22:22:05+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

Users' transactions can remain private until they are confirmed on the chain, which means that robots cannot preempt transactions.‚Ä¶\n‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 15, 2024\n\nEigenPhi claims that by 2023 alone, these MEVs will cost Ethereum users up to 124,000 ETH, or more than $350 million at current pricing. By preserving user transactions confidential until they are verified on-chain, smart transactions stop bots from frontrunning them.\nBecause MetaMask pre-simulates every transaction, users will also benefit from lower gas costs and higher transaction success rates. Transparent and improved user experience are achieved by showing real-time transaction progress right inside the MetaMask wallet.\nThe Special Mechanisms Group, an advanced research division of Consensys, developed a new mempool virtualization technique that contributes to many improvements in Smart Transactions.\nUsers of this cutting-edge technology have greater visibility, control, and privacy over their transactions, independent of network constraints.\nDuring beta testing, Smart Transactions achieved a stunning 99.5% transaction success rate, which is far above the industry average. More value for users when trading and transacting results from this high success rate.\nSmart transactions save customers money and eliminate unforeseen expenses by better anticipating gas prices, avoiding expensive frontrunning, and removing failed transactions.\nThe ability of users to track the real-time status of their outstanding transactions on an easy-to-use dashboard inside MetaMask is one of Smart Transactions‚Äô best features. With less need to visit unaffiliated websites or block explorers, users may see more clearly and feel more secure.\nDirector of the Special Mechanisms Group, Jason Linehan, stressed the effect of Smart Transactions on the user experience. He said:\n‚ÄúWith smart transactions, users can automatically look after the transactions they sign and what happens to them once they are delivered to the blockchain network. There is no better approach to improving your user experience.‚Äù\nBy 2023, unsuccessful transactions would have cost over 52,000 ETH, or more over $153 million at current pricing. Furthermore, users lost financial value when clever bots forran successful transactions.\nThrough the mitigation of these problems, Smart Transactions offer MetaMask users a more dependable and affordable option.\nExecutive Director of Product at MetaMask, Gal Eldar outlined the impending improvements to the transaction lifecycle made possible by Smart Transactions.\n‚ÄúTransaction submission to a dispersed network is challenging. The user experience that arises from this complexity is frequently both unanticipated and frustrating. Many times, frontrunning assaults, expensive on-chain reverts, and overpayments for block space result in large financial leaks. Whether they realize it or not, a lot of consumers have encountered and grudgingly accepted this truth. It was becoming more and more evident with time that we could do better and address these issues directly,‚Äù he stated.\nAlso, MetaMask will keep supporting custom RPCs and raw transactions for developers and consumers who would rather have more options when connecting to a blockchain. The full potential of Ethereum and web3 cannot be realized without these improvements.\nOn the other hand, an earlier ETHNews article highlighted the SEC‚Äôs investigation of Ethereum ETFs, which resulted in a lawsuit against Consensys.\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T10:00:39+00:00","tag":"","author":"Syofri"},

This grant will support ten rounds of Quadratic Funding within the Cosmos Hub ecosystem over the next two years.\n\nAs one of the largest treasury funding applications, this proposal sparked extensive discussions within the Cosmos community and received overwhelming support. Over $1 billion worth of ATOM, including major validators and core Cosmos contributors, voted in favor. The approval rate reached 91.9%, making Gov Proposal 917 the motion with the highest approval rating in the Cosmos Hub‚Äôs history.\nFollowing the approval of this proposal, Dora Factory, in collaboration with DoraHacks, has officially announced the second AEZ (ATOM Economic Zone) quadratic funding program, marking the launch of the first long-term funding initiative. This quadratic funding program will span two years, starting May 15, 2024, and ending May 2026.\nThe passing of Gov Proposal 917 brings native Quadratic Funding to the Cosmos Hub for the first time.\nWhat is Public Goods Funding?\nPublic goods funding is a frequently discussed concept within the Web3 industry. Generally, public goods refer to goods or services that are available for everyone to use.\nIn crypto, public goods can include blockchain infrastructure, storage, developer tools, software middleware, and user-facing applications such as block explorers, data dashboards, and wallets.\nDue to its inherent transparency and verifiability, crypto and blockchain are ideal tools for funding public goods.\nHowever, web3 public goods funding also faces numerous challenges.\nEnter Dora Factory, which strives to build infrastructure that enables large-scale adoption of public goods funding.\nDora Factory: Infrastructure Born for Public Goods\nDora Factory is a leading decentralised governance infrastructure and multi-chain public goods funding protocol stack, incubated and supported by DoraHacks, the industry‚Äôs developer and public goods funding platform. Its products include Public Good Staking infrastructure and Dora Vota, an appchain for voting and governance designed to empower the global Hacker Movement, open-source communities, and DAOs.\nMulti-Chain Quadratic Funding: Aligning Communities and Ecosystem Builders\nWhat is Quadratic Funding? Through native-token donations, token-holder communities can support high-quality early-stage projects and public goods within various ecosystems, fostering better collaboration among foundations, communities, and developers.\nAs the first and only team in the industry to develop and advocate for this approach, Dora Factory is a true leader in multi-chain quadratic funding. It has successfully deployed native quadratic funding in numerous mainstream crypto ecosystems, including BNB Chain, Solana, Polygon, Aptos, Cosmos Hub, Injective, and Avalanche.\nPublic Good Staking: Providing Sustainable Funding for Public Goods\nIn late 2022, Dora Factory introduced the concept of Public Good Staking. By operating underlying infrastructure such as validators, they earn native block rewards that are continuously used to fund multi-chain developers and public goods ecosystems.\nDora Factory has promoted public good staking in over 30 ecosystems‚Äô mainnets and testnets, achieving a TVL (Total Value Locked) of over $400 million, providing up to $10 million in sustainable annual funding.\nIn the future, Dora Factory will explore ways to use cryptocurrency to fund cutting-edge technology fields like space technology, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and biomedical research.\nCommunity Incentive Fund: Making Public Goods Funding More Fun\nDora Factory launched the Community Incentive Fund to make the public goods funding process more engaging and fun. Top meme and NFT projects like Celestia‚Äôs Celestine Sloth Collection, Injective Ninja, Aptos Gui Inu, and Aptos Monkeys have become partners of the Community Incentive Fund. Through retroactive airdrops and gamified donations, these projects have brought more fun to public goods funding, receiving contributions and donations from nearly 100,000 unique addresses across different communities.\nAnonymous Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (aMACI): Bringing Privacy Technology to On-Chain Public Goods Governance\nMACI is a cryptographic technology designed to maximize the detection and elimination of collusion in voting. In 2022 and 2023, the Dora Factory team collaborated with ETHDenver, 0x, and OpenSea to introduce privacy voting to crypto hackathons. MACI has significantly improved privacy and reduced collusion in on-chain governance and voting.\nIn 2024, Dora Factory launched aMACI, adding voter anonymity to eliminate collusion between the vote initiator and the operator. This further enhances privacy and lowers the usage threshold of MACI voting. This is a significant step towards future large-scale decentralized voting systems.\nDora Vota: Open Infrastructure for Public Goods Funding\nDora Vota is a multi-chain governance and voting infrastructure. Vota and interoperability protocols like IBC will provide modular voting and governance infrastructure, such as plug-and-play quadratic funding modules and grant distribution mechanisms. As the first permissionless appchain focused on scaling on-chain voting, Dora Vota will offer developers a valuable playground, unlocking more possibilities for public goods funding and decentralized community governance.\nRecently, Dora Factory secured strategic financing from dao5, Whampoa Digital, and angel investors like EigenLayer co-founder Calvin Liu. This is the first strategic round of a new funding series since Dora Factory‚Äôs $17.5M raise in 2021.\nAs Dora‚Äôs Public Good Staking grows and Vota‚Äôs ecosystem matures, the team believes Dora Factory will continue exploring new solutions to traditional funding inefficiencies, accelerating the maturity of governance and public goods funding in the multi-chain ecosystem.\n\nCommunity contributor Chris Lee Dora Factory winniedrinkwater@gmail.com\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T18:58:14+00:00","tag":"","author":"chainwire"},

In this environment, three cryptos stand out: Rollblock (RBLK), Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Litecoin (LTC). While most traders are familiar with ETC and LTC, RBLK is a Stage 2 presale sensation that analysts believe could 1000x in 2024.\nPositioned to disrupt the online gambling market, which was valued at $450 in 2023, Rollblock (RBLK) is making headlines thanks to its innovative GambleFi protocol. Its ongoing presale has been sensational as it has sold millions of RBLK tokens, raising over $200,000 so far. Certain projections indicate this number could reach $1M before May 2024 ends.\nUnlike popular platforms like Stake or Fairspin, Rollblock launched a fully licensed online crypto casino that does not require any sign-up KYC checks. Thus, users can only sign up with an email; no additional downloads are required. With this development, they remain anonymous when playing hundreds of casino games.\nA major selling point of Rollblock and something that sets it apart from the competition is its revenue-sharing model, which gives back to the community and RBLK token holders. Notably, Rollblock utilizes up to 30% of its weekly profits to buy RBLK tokens off the open market. Next, 50% of these tokens are given to RBLK stakers as staking rewards and the other 50% of tokens are burnt. This means 2 things, RBLK will be a very deflationary asset and the supply will continuously be reducing over time but also Rollblock will be able to offer holders some of the most lucrative passive income opportunities in crypto. One RBLK token now costs just $0.012, a 20% increase from its starting price of $0.01. However, this is a Stage 2 presale price and there are 12 stages in total with the price expected to increase by over 500% in the presale alone. Because of this, market analysts predict that RBLK will reach $1 once it hits Tier-1 exchanges in Q3 of 2024. With this prediction, RBLK emerges as the best new crypto to invest in this year.\nRecently, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has been riding a bullish wave. Over the last 12 months, the Ethereum Classic price increased by nearly 45%, as per CoinMarketCap data. This bullish trend may continue with the recent Brale announcement that it will support ETC‚Äôs first regulated stablecoin, USC.\nThe technical analysis for the Ethereum Classic crypto also shows some bullish signs. For example, Ethereum Classic is trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs while boasting 13 green technical indicators. As a result, experts have made a bullish Ethereum Classic price prediction. They foresee a rise to $32 within Q2 of 2024 for ETC, making it a good crypto to buy.\nMeanwhile, Litecoin (LTC) has been experiencing some volatility. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Litecoin price sank nearly 10% over the past 12 months. During that time, its market cap also dropped from $6.50B to $6B. However, the technical analysis for Litecoin shows a more bullish picture.\nThe Litecoin crypto trades above its 50-day EMA, while six technical indicators show buy signals. Due to all these reasons, analysts are still bullish. Their Litecoin price predictions foresee a rise to $105 before Q2 of 2024 ends. As a result, Litecoin remains one of the top crypto coins.\nRollblock‚Äôs $12M market cap makes it more appealing than Ethereum Classic and Litecoin. In other words, RBLK needs less new capital injected into it for its price to surge. Because of this advantage, RBLK is the best crypto investment for those looking for fast returns.

Detailed Market Analysis","content":" Ethereum‚Äôs price has decreased by nearly 10% over the past week, with an additional 1% decline in the past day, bringing its 24-hour low to $2,868.\nThis downturn contrasts with Bitcoin, which has achieved several price gains despite similar market conditions.\nThe decline in Ethereum‚Äôs value can be attributed to trading activities by large-scale investors, known as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù which have increased market volatility and selling pressure. Moreover, key metrics indicate a decrease in investor engagement with Ethereum.\nGlassnode‚Äôs data reveals that the total of active Ethereum addresses has fallen from a high of 564,868 in late April to 468,548 as of now. Additionally, the creation of new Ethereum addresses has declined significantly, dropping from 196,629 at the beginning of the month to under 85,000 as of May 11. These statistics suggest a decrease in investor engagement with Ethereum recently.\n\nTechnical analyses show that Ethereum has broken through important support levels on the daily chart, suggesting continued downward pressure. On the 4-hour chart, liquidity near the $3,200 level needs to be absorbed before any further decline can occur.\nThis condition suggests that Ethereum might temporarily rise above $3,000 before possibly declining to around $2,800, potentially setting up a future rally.\n\nAdditionally, there have been movements in the Bitcoin market, where two wallets that had been inactive for nearly 11 years, each holding 500 BTC, were activated and liquidated their holdings, contributing to the current market dynamics.\nThese market changes are for investors and Ethereum holders to consider, providing insight into immediate market responses and longer-term trends that may affect Ethereum‚Äôs pricing and market stability. Understanding these factors is essential for investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market.\n","create_date":"2024-05-14T05:00:50+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

Market analysts attribute this rise to the current sluggishness in the market, which has led traders to seek any possible investment opportunities.\nDaan Crypto Trades, reported that investors are engaging in these memecoins out of boredom, looking for any sign of positive movement. Ed Hindi, the Chief Investment Officer at Tyr Capital, observed that the sudden interest in GameStop memecoins suggests that there is capital in the market that is not being effectively used.\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap and Google Finance, a Solana-based memecoin named GameStop, which is not affiliated with the GameStop corporation, saw an increase of 2,727% over two days.\n\nConcurrently, the actual GameStop stock experienced a 204.50% increase in its price. In the last 24 hours alone, the GME memecoin has increased by 65.68%.\n\nThis trading fervor coincided with the return of Keith Gill, known as ‚ÄúRoaring Kitty,‚Äù to social media. Gill, a noted GameStop stock trader, posted on his X account on May 12, marking his first social media activity since June 19, 2021. His post, a cryptic meme, signaled his re-entry into the trading scene.\npic.twitter.com/YgjVqtgcNS\n‚Äî Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) May 13, 2024\n\nDuring this same timeframe, only two crypto out of the top 100‚ÄîPEPE and Floki‚Äîmanaged to maintain considerable gains, with increases of 35.73% and 11.27%, respectively. Other popular cryptomeme like DOGE and Shiba Inu initially spiked but have since seen declines of 1.76% and 1.39% over the past 24 hours.\n\nMarket sentiment, as measured by the Fear and Greed Index, has declined over the past 30 days, now standing at a ‚ÄúGreed‚Äù score of 64 as of May 15.\nDaan commented that the increase in GameStop stock prices has given crypto traders confidence that related memecoins might also see price increases. They mentioned that price movements often lead traders to create narratives to explain market behaviors.\nHaving your stock become a meme can be quite valuable.

For instance, the return on Ethereum (ETH) staked has dropped from above 5% to about 3.18% as of writing.\nMajor cryptocurrencies are no longer as often staked to generate income on their holdings, according to CCData. For example, yields on individuals holding Cardano (ADA) decreased from 3.35% in May 2023 to 3.07% as of May 16, 2024.\nThe biggest overall drop among the cryptocurrencies monitored was seen in Polkadot (DOT), sometimes known as the blockchain of blockchains, as staking yields fell from slightly over 22% to 18.64%. Yields for Avalanche (AVAX) likewise fell, from 7.05% in May 2023 to 6.42% as of writing.\nRival Ethereum‚Äôs staking yield, Solana (SOL), has held steady, rising from about 7.5% in May 2023 to almost 7.7% at the time of writing. Given the wider tendency of falling yields, this steadiness is significant.\nCoinMarketCap data shows that the price of SOL at the time of writing was about $162.28, up 3.67% from the previous day. This also shows a solid position over the last seven days, up 8.88%.\nOwners of cryptocurrencies can take part in the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism of a network and get rewards via staking. Although many liquid staking systems let token holders get a liquid derivative token when locking their tokens to stake, staked tokens are typically locked while receiving rewards, echoing earlier coverage by ETHNews.\nSome staking services, such those frequently provided by centralised cryptocurrency exchanges, may charge fees on the staking earnings in return for the service, therefore lowering the yields that investors get from these platforms.\nThe staking yields have decreased, but during the last year, the cryptocurrency market has grown significantly. A noteworthy rally that saw the price of Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $73,500 before suffering a pullback saw the market add over $1 trillion.\n","create_date":"2024-05-17T11:00:25+00:00","tag":"","author":"Syofri"},

They are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and engaging in money laundering activities. The brothers were taken into custody on accusations of manipulating the Ethereum blockchain, which allegedly led to them wrongfully obtaining $25 million in crypto.\nDuring this brief period, the brothers reportedly manipulated the transaction validation protocols of the Ethereum blockchain.

Despite this, the prosecution stressed its dedication to maintaining the integrity of financial systems against such sophisticated threats.\nFollowing the event, the New York Field Office of the IRS Criminal Investigation acted swiftly to probe the alleged blockchain manipulation. They utilized a mix of cutting-edge technology and established investigative techniques to trace the misdirected funds.\nThomas Fattorusso, the Special Agent in Charge, highlighted the effectiveness of blending modern technology with proven investigative techniques in solving the case.\nAn IRS special agent said, ‚ÄúIn this case, IRS-CI New York‚Äôs Cyber Unit simply followed the money. Regardless of the complexity of the case, we continue to lead the effort in financial criminal investigations with cutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain.‚Äù\nThe IRS emphasized their methodical approach to financial investigations, which includes tracing money flows to uncover criminal activities. Their efforts underline the commitment to thorough investigation, regardless of the intricacies involved.\nShould Anton and James Peraire-Bueno be convicted, they face the possibility of up to 20 years in prison for each offense. It is alleged that they tried to hide their unlawful actions by investigating cryptocurrency exchanges with lax identity checks and consulting lawyers on how to evade prosecution for cryptocurrency-related offenses.\nAnton and James Peraire-Bueno are set to appear in court before U.S. Magistrate Judges in Massachusetts and New York, where the legal proceedings will continue to unfold, providing further examination into both the technical details of blockchain manipulation and the corresponding legal implications.\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T22:07:16+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

Spot On Chain tweeted recently that whales have begun to benefit after the PEPE price hit a new all-time high (ATH) in the last 24 hours.\nWhales have taken profits after the $PEPE price recorded a new ATH (24H)! Have you taken yours?\n1. Early holder 0x647 deposited 250B $PEPE ($2.69M) to #Binance ~12 hours ago. ‚Äì The whale has 42.4B $PEPE ($424K) left with a total profit of $3.96M (+8,833%).\n2. Whale 0xa4f 123.7B‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/AxUxvMSYac\n‚Äî Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) May 14, 2024\n\nNot too long ago, a whale going by the wallet address 0x647 made a startling $250 billion PEPE (around $2.69 million) deposit to Binance. Currently holding 42.4 billion PEPE, or around $424,000, this whale has made $3.96 million in profit, or an astounding 8,833% return on investment.\nAn other noteworthy transaction concerned the whale with the wallet address 0xa4f, who, around 13 hours ago, sold 123.7 billion PEPE for 1.31 million USDC. After just three days, this purchase yielded a profit of $223,000, or 20.5%.\nCoinMarketCap data shows that PEPE is currently valued at about $0.0000103. This represents a bullish tendency to make a new ATH during the previous seven days, with a rise of 25.81% and a 23.80% increase in the last 24 hours. The price rise has increased PEPE‚Äôs market cap to more than $4.3 billion.\nThe whale activity of late is not unusual. Before, as previously reported by ETHNews, a well-known crypto whale going by the wallet address 0xa14 withdrawn 350.2 billion PEPE‚Äîwhich was worth $2.92 million at the time‚Äî from the Binance exchange.\nThese swings highlight the substantial interest and calculated profit-taking of the big PEPE market participants.\nOn the other hand, inside the Ethereum network in particular, PEPE Coin has attracted a lot of interest. As noted in earlier ETHNews reports, PEPE‚Äôs higher transaction volumes than those of its rivals have made it a popular memecoin.\nIts high transaction volume and popularity have aided in the market cap increase and quick price appreciation.\nWhale profit-taking lately would point to a possible short-term PEPE price fall. Overall, though, the bullish trend points to ongoing interest in and investment in this memecoin.\n","create_date":"2024-05-14T12:00:49+00:00","tag":"","author":"Syofri"},

This change will take effect from May 28, 2024, at 06:00 (UTC). The exchange has announced that it will remove XRP and TrueUSD (TUSD) as margin assets in its Multi-Assets Mode.\nStarting May 14, 2024, at 06:00 (UTC), Binance will set the transfer-in limit for XRP and TUSD to zero in this mode. After the cutoff on May 28, any remaining balances of XRP and TUSD in USDS-M Futures wallets will automatically convert to Tether (USDT) within about 24 hours.\nBinance has advised its users not to open new futures positions during this period to prevent potential financial losses. This advice is crucial as the establishment of new positions during the transition could result in unpredictable financial outcomes.\nAfter Binance‚Äôs announcement, XRP‚Äôs price increased slightly by 0.51% and is currently trading at $0.5059. The trading volume for XRP has also risen by 4.46% to $815.87 million. In the last 24 hours, XRP‚Äôs price moved from a low of $0.4977 to a high of $0.5117.\nBinance‚Äôs decision aims to streamline its operations and adjust to the current market conditions, while also prioritizing the protection of its users‚Äô interests. This decision is part of Binance‚Äôs broader strategy to adapt to the evolving market environment.\nAlongside these market changes, Ripple is facing legal challenges. The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has seen recent developments, including filings to seal critical documents.\nJonathan Bilich, Ripple‚Äôs CFO, supports these filings to keep sensitive financial information, contract terms, and internal business strategies confidential. These measures are intended to protect Ripple‚Äôs proprietary information during its legal proceedings.\n#XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP @Ripple has filed a Motion to Seal Certain Documents filed in connection with the @SECGov's Motion for Judgment and Remedies. https://t.co/BCeLaHOnw0\n‚Äî James K.

These developments underscore the importance of staying informed and adaptable in the ever-changing cryptocurrency market.\n","create_date":"2024-05-14T13:44:49+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},

This is a big step in restoring the health and credibility of the ecosystem‚Äîremoving tokens from wallets that are blacklisted.\nNEW DAO PROPOSAL: BURN 15,246,000,000 $FLOKI TOKENS\nA new Floki DAO proposal just went live on whether or not to burn 15,246,000,000 $FLOKI tokens.\nPlease read the proposal and vote here üëáüëáüëáhttps://t.co/UVzQdYQUpu pic.twitter.com/j1mi6XrVZ0\n‚Äî FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) May 13, 2024\n\nThe community made clear that the goal of this large burn is to remove tokens from blacklisted wallets. Tokens in blacklisted wallets cannot be used or moved; hence, until they are delivered to the Floki multisig, they are practically worthless.\nThe group wants to make sure these tokens are never again in circulation; hence, they are being burned.\nIt is not a novel concept to suggest burning these tokens. Its origins are in a 2022 vote in which the community decided to destroy any extra retrieved tokens.\nThe Floki Inu community has underlined the need for this measure, saying that burning the returned tokens is the only just way to remove them from the market forever and is in line with community expectations.\nThe Floki DAO pledged to send people impacted 1% of the value of the returned tokens, or about 154 million FLOKI, as a goodwill gesture in order to encourage other wallets to engage in burning excess tokens. There is strong support for this effort; 232 votes have been cast in favor.\nThere has been previous voting by the Floki Inu community to burn tokens. A whopping 190.9 billion tokens that were retrieved from the multi-chain bridge were voted to be burned by the community in February.\nThe Floki DAO quickly implements these decisions, highlighting the decentralized character of the coin and the DAO‚Äôs final say over the project‚Äôs course.\nCoinMarketCap reports that FLOKI‚Äôs price as of writing is at $0,0001956, up 4.2% over the previous 24 hours. The significant 13.23% increase over the previous week indicates that price action has been bullish. The encouraging market response heightens the anticipation surrounding the token burn plan.\nOn the other hand, a recent ETHNews article highlighting a major development for Floki Inu added to the momentum. More than 12 million people can now use FLOKI for actual transactions thanks to the cryptocurrency‚Äôs association with Binance Pay.\nFor FLOKI owners, this integration creates new opportunities and increases its adaptability and practicality in daily situations.\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T09:00:00+00:00","tag":"","author":"Syofri"},

With the support and confidence of thousands of users and investors worldwide, this ground-breaking platform is experiencing a meteoric rise in popularity.\nIn addition, ETFSwap (ETFS) is gaining global recognition as a significant player in the tokenized ETF market. It offers a platform that is both distinctive and accessible, as well as unique and user-friendly, for trading cryptocurrencies and ETFs.\nETFSwap (ETFS) Records Unprecedented Surge To Cross 4,000 Users\nAs of November 2023, the global ETFs industry reached a valuation of $10.99 trillion and has been growing rapidly ever since. Given this expansion, an increasing number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors have looked for ways to engage with the potential in this sector.\nETFSwap (ETFS) emerges as a bridge between the traditional and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This platform offers investment opportunities for global investors, exposing them to trillion-dollar sectors such as health, energy, technology, commodities, and more\nETFSwap (ETFS) offers crypto investors a novel service that has never been seen in the industry. It allows access to the trillion-dollar traditional ETFs market, allowing them to expand their investment portfolio by tokenizing these assets for easy trading. But perhaps where ETFSwap (ETFS) really outpaces its competitors is that it presents an easy on-and-off ramp for trading ETFs using both crypto and fiat, coupled with the decentralization of the Ethereum blockchain.\nOver the next year, the platform plans to complete its roadmap with the full launch of the ETFSwap (ETFS) trading platform open for all. Additionally, it‚Äôll launch its partnership program, launch its staking decentralized application (DApp), and roll out community rewards.\nIts token will launch on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, with open public trading to follow.

The audit found no vulnerabilities in its contract, with the company declaring it safe for investment.\nAhead of its full platform launch, the company is focused on securing all necessary licenses required to bring this novel service to investors worldwide. To sweeten the pot, it requires no KYC (Know Your Customer), which means investors just need to connect their wallet to start trading on the website.\nETFSwap (ETFS) is already seeing unparalleled adoption amongst users across diverse regions globally. Currently, the innovative platform has recorded more than 4,000 users in just a few weeks.\nThis surge in adoption is fueled not only by ETFSwap‚Äôs (ETFS) advanced trading technology and capabilities but also by the rising interest in tokenized ETFs within the digital asset landscape.\nKey Milestones and Presale Progress\nThanks to ETFSwap users‚Äô, ETFSwap (ETFS) has successfully hit key developmental milestones.

This request is part of an ongoing lawsuit concerning the sale of XRP, which the SEC claims was unregistered.\nWant to know the craziest part about the SEC's demand for disgorgement in the @Ripple case?\nThis üëá pic.twitter.com/Z5A0KQDf6o\n‚Äî MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) May 14, 2024\n\nAttorney James Murphy, known online as ‚ÄúMetaLawMan‚Äù challenges the SEC‚Äôs proposal that the disgorgement funds should be directed to institutional buyers of XRP. Citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Murphy points out that disgorgement should benefit the victims of the violation. He argues that directing funds to institutional buyers, who have profited from their dealings with Ripple, does not align with this legal standard.\n‚ÄúOne thing the U.S. Supreme Court has been really clear about is that disgorgement is supposed to go to the victims.‚Äù\nMurphy‚Äôs critique brings to light the question of how the disgorgement funds are allocated. The SEC suggests that these funds go to institutional investors, a group that may not represent the direct victims in this case. This approach raises concerns about the appropriateness and fairness of the disgorgement distribution.\nIn response, Ripple‚Äôs legal team, including attorney Bill Morgan, contests the SEC‚Äôs demands. Morgan states that the SEC‚Äôs understanding of financial harm ignores the actual contractual terms under which institutional buyers engaged with Ripple. According to Morgan, these transactions were conducted in compliance with existing legal frameworks, and the buyers were not misled.\nAttorney Bill Morgan reposted Attorney James Murphy‚Äôs post, further adding his sentiment on behalf of Ripple. ‚ÄúThe SEC‚Äôs theory of pecuniary harm ignores contractual and commercial reality,‚Äù stated Morgan, underscoring the contractual and commercial realities overlooked by the SEC.\nThe legal arguments extend beyond the issue of disgorgement. Both Ripple and the SEC are involved in extensive legal proceedings, including the submission of various legal briefs and motions that address multiple aspects of the case.\nThe focus currently includes procedural matters, particularly regarding the sealing of sensitive information tied to the court‚Äôs decisions on the remedies proposed in the lawsuit.\nThe decisions made in this case will likely influence future regulatory actions within the U.S. cryptocurrency market. The court‚Äôs rulings on the allocation of disgorgement funds and the broader legal interpretations applied in this case could set precedents for how similar cases are handled in the future.\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T13:39:28+00:00","tag":"","author":"Isai Alexei"},
