The price of Bitcoin briefly hit $44,000.\nAccording to Coingecko data, Bitcoin has slowly grown after weeks of struggle, surpassing the $45,000 barrier‚Äîa 1% gain in the previous 24 hours and a roughly 20% increase in the last 30 days.\nThe biggest digital currency in the world, according to CoinMarketCap, just reached a price of over $45,000 on February 10.\nBitcoin is showing a pattern that suggests it can keep up the gains it has made recently. According to Bloomberg Markets‚Äô crypto tracking, a so-called triangle form on Bitcoin‚Äôs price chart is compressing tighter and the currency is prodding at the triangle‚Äôs top end.\n\nSource\nCardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) have all had their prices rise by over 10% in the previous week, with BTC leading the charge.\nAs a result of these price rises, the cryptocurrency market now exceeds $2 trillion.\nAfter breaking past the $40,000 barrier last week, bitcoin has sustained its advances and is currently trading at the upper bounds of the $44,000 zone it has been trading in since the start of the year.\nThis week, the S&P 500 index is expected to rise 1.4 percent, while the Nasdaq is expected to rise around 2 percent. Bitcoin has risen by approximately 6% in the last week.\nSome commentators have long referred to Bitcoin as ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù‚Äîa safe-haven asset that will stay steady when all other assets fall.\nSome crypto specialists believe that Bitcoin has only briefly fallen below its four-year moving average once in its history, which implies that the record price achieved four years ago is now regarded as the ultimate bottom by some crypto specialists.\nWhen Bitcoin does well, the rest of the market often (but not always) follows suit. It‚Äôs been a fantastic week, thanks in part to a historic Wall Street announcement: on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs became the first major US bank to make a crypto transaction.\nAccording to some, this has increased investor confidence, as investors see large quantities of money and interest from established firms as a reason to become engaged and invest in crypto.\n***\n\n","create_date":"2022-03-26T08:07:21+00:00","tag":"","author":"Mridul Srivastava"},

One among such enthusiasts is Yoshitaka Kitao. He is the CEO of currency exchange, SBI Virtual Currencies.\nAs per reports, Kitao says that there are high chances that XRP will hit $10 in its price value. But, the questions remain whether the prediction comes out as true or not.\nThe company behind the coin XRP is Ripple. It has a mission to acquire as many tech companies in its hands. Codius Smart is one among such tech companies to be in its recent list. Codius Smart is a contracting platform which Coil released.\nAs per matter of fact, Ripple‚Äôs former CTO or Chief Technology OfficerRuns Coil. The CEO of Coil is Stefan Thomas.\nHowever, Codius is a platform which helps to boost the interoperability of various block chains. It also has the aim to facilitate web monetization. And, it is a system that can bring about positive effects on the crypto world. It is because the platform provides a channel for XP focusing cases. The development of such cases is possible with the platform of Codius.\nRipple has high aims to integrate its blockchain with the platform of Codius. The company also introduces innovative payment solutions. Banks and financial institutions can use these payment solutions. However, the users who like banks and financial institutes who need fast liquidity will opt it. One more point that the service will provide is, the institutes can use it for cross-border transactions.\nRapid is the technology of Ripple is to come which is very handy. The technology, xRapid will use XRP as its transfer currency. With it, Ripple targets direct increment in its pricing. It is because if more banks use XRP on the RippleNet, the demand for XRP will increase. Therefore, if the demand for XRP increases, it means the price hike for Ripple.\nCEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse comments on the topic. He says that in the year 2019, more banks will use RippleNet for Ripple technology. As a result, he means that it might start a bull run to take Ripple to $10 level.\nPreviously, xRapid, the technology of Ripple gets honor in the Fast Company‚Äôs 2019 World Changing Ideas Award.\nAs the crypto market gets slow in its bull race, Ripple does not give up. It continues making major collaborations and expansion. As per reports, the company enters into partnership with GMT. GMT is the largest bank in Israel. This is a move Ripple makes to boost its financial aspects and consolidate its global dominance.\nHowever, GMT issue a public announcement that both the companies have similar philosophies. According to it, it is the main reason for their collaboration. GMT says that similar philosophies helped them for mutually beneficial terms.\nFurthermore, GMT explains that it decided to choose Ripple after a precise discussion. By working together, they can contribute to creating global financial systems. It added that, with the use of high-end technologies, it would result in an affordable and transparent system.\n","create_date":"2019-04-12T14:46:33+00:00","tag":"","author":"Kesarwani"},

Starting with 2021, it‚Äôs all over the internet, almost more than the pandemic.\nIf you are here, it means that your curiosity is making its way ‚Äì and you are about to discover one of the best financial options in today‚Äôs era.\nWith that being said, let‚Äôs see what DeFi is all about.\nTo put it as simple as possible, Decentralized Finance is a type of crypto service built to replace the traditional banking system by providing people with more independence and financial security.\nIf you‚Äôre asking yourself why traditional banking services need to be upgraded, then think about all the unpleasant situations you encountered with while wanting to benefit from bank offers.\nLow transfer processes, high taxes, blocked accounts, and let‚Äôs not forget how vulnerable our assets are against cyber attacks.\nDeFi was developed to overcome all of these issues, and the advantages are huge. Far beyond how we imagined the financial sector a couple of years ago.\nMost banking issues come from human error, and this is the main reason why people are switching to DeFi services.\nUsually, you need to wait for a couple of days for somebody to approve a transfer ‚Äì especially if the partner is signed in for other bank providers. Many bank accounts are blocked due to ‚Äúsuspicious activities‚Äù, and everything is such a nuisance.\nBut DeFi activities are made just between you and your partner. The transfers are a lot quicker, and you‚Äôre the only one who manages your assets.\nSpeaking on managing your assets, you don‚Äôt need to pay the bank anymore ‚Äì meaning bank employees, rent, and other elements that contribute to the bank services‚Äô price.\nThis means higher security than anything a bank could offer. Because in order to hack an account, malicious actors would need to own at least 51% of the total supply of tokens.\nDeFi Coins, for example, offers rewards depending on how much of the total supply of tokens you own. For example, if you own 1% of the total supply, you would get 1% of the exchange tax per user. Every time a user sells something on the platform, you will instantly be rewarded. It‚Äôs a continuous process.\nForget about bank services and upgrade your game. Join a safer and more profitable financial option.

Presently, the device is yet to be named.\nSony has created a contactless IC card hardware wallet, which is small, useful and portable, unlike other existing hardware wallets which connect to PCs through USB.\nThe benefit of this hardware wallet is that it facilitates one to safely store and generate a private key with a highly reliable tamper-proof module, all within the IC card itself.\nThe hardware wallet includes mutual encrypted communication technology. The IC card crypto hardware wallet can not only be used for digital currency transactions but can also operate private key utilized for other reasons like allowing the use of personal-data-utilizing blockchain technology.\nThe officials in the company claim that the hardware wallet is not only used for receiving and sending cryptocurrency but it is also created to include multi-purpose uses.\nHowever, it is still unknown when the mass roll-out of this product will be scheduled.\nSony CSL was founded by Sony Corporation in February 1988, with an aim to change the world we are living in. Recently, It has joined many multinational companies in experimenting with the decentralized blockchain technology. The company has launched many solutions and applied for patents related to blockchain hardware.\nEarlier this year, the Japanese financial services organization SBI holdings obtained 40 percent of Taiwan-based crypto hardware wallet firm CoolBitx.\nA leading security-aimed hardware wallet supplier, Ledger had disclosed in July that it sold more than one million wallets last year, and earned a profit of 29 million dollars.\nThe company will continue advancing towards marketing the cryptocurrency hardware wallet technology that permits secure and safe transactions of crypto assets.

Initially, Celsius had decided that January 3 was the cutoff date.\nThe lender warned in its application, granted last month by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, that creditors who refused to submit their claims risked losing out on the distribution of the funds it was holding. But it just announced on social media that it wants a one-month extension.\nCelsius is preparing to file a motion later this week requesting an extension of the bar date, which is the deadline to file a claim, from January 3, 2023, until early February.\n‚Äî Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) December 29, 2022\n\nThe New York Bankruptcy Court will consider the request for an extension on January 10, 2023, one week beyond the original deadline.

Mike Novogratz‚Äôs Galaxy Digital, a financial services business focusing on digital assets, acquired the GK8 self-custody technology and is one amongst them.

Learn why it's popular in this article.","title":"Why Do Developers Want to Use PaaS? - TheCryptoUpdates","content":" Programming is a complicated process. It involves creating, managing, and distributing applications. With so many tasks, staying on top of the latest trends and tools can be difficult. Many developers fail to accomplish their goals because they don‚Äôt have the right resources or experience. To overcome this obstacle, companies have developed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).\nPaaS is a cloud computing platform that enables developers to create, deploy and manage applications. It provides tools and services that automate the app development process and reduce the time and effort needed to build an application. It also helps developers save money on hosting infrastructure and simplifies the process of scaling and managing applications. Its amazing benefits are encouraging developers to partner with PaaS companies to develop their applications. This blog post will look at why developers want to use PaaS and how it can help them achieve their goals. So, let‚Äôs get into it.\nPaaS provides developers with a comprehensive suite of development tools and services. These include application programming interfaces (APIs), web servers, databases, and cloud hosting. With PaaS, developers don‚Äôt need to worry about buying or maintaining hardware, as the platform already provides all these services. It saves their efforts and time, so they can focus on creating the best applications possible.\nSome PaaS vendors also offer various development environments and language runtimes, so developers can easily get started with their projects. Getting all the required software development tools, like a compiler, debugger, or source code repository, in one integrated environment help them increase productivity, thus speeding up the development process.\nPaaS also helps developers deploy their applications quickly and easily. It provides automated deployment tools that help developers test and deploy their apps with minimal effort. It reduces the time between development and deployment and helps developers keep up with the ever-changing market conditions.\nAutomated software deployment tools also help in managing a development team by simplifying the collaboration process. Developers can track their progress easily, so they can make informed decisions and focus on the features that are most important for their applications. The tools allow team members to work on different parts of the project without any conflict, thus ensuring smooth and timely delivery of updates.\nScaling applications is difficult for developers, as it requires them to manage the hardware and software components. PaaS simplifies this process by providing automated tools for scaling applications and resources. It helps developers efficiently manage their workloads, thus allowing them to focus on their core business objectives.\nFurthermore, PaaS also allows developers to host their applications in multiple cloud environments. It makes it easier for developers to manage their applications and resources across different regions.\nSoftware development is a lengthy process, and it takes a lot of time to get an application to market. With PaaS, however, developers can accelerate their marketing efforts by automating the development and deployment process. Automated solutions by PaaS vendors can help developers to focus on coding and testing the application faster. It can help them to launch their applications in a short duration.\nPaaS vendors handle the software launching process and support the entire product life cycle. It helps developers to respond quickly to customer requirements, resulting in faster time-to-market.\nPaaS vendors offer developers a single environment to perform all the tasks related to software development. A developer doesn‚Äôt need to switch between different platforms or services to perform various tasks, thus saving them time and effort. All the required resources are available in one integrated environment, making it easier for developers to focus on their core tasks and develop better applications in less time.\nBy offering a single environment, PaaS helps you save training time and simplifies the maintenance process. The development team is not required to familiarize themselves with different platforms for various tasks. It helps them to focus on the development process and deliver better results.\nSoftware development is a costly affair, and it involves a lot of non-development costs, such as server maintenance. PaaS helps to reduce these costs by providing automated deployment tools and resources. It helps businesses save money and reduce the cost of software development, thus allowing them to stay competitive in the market.\nWith PaaS, there is no need to invest in expensive hardware and software solutions. It offers an array of tools and services that can help developers to build feature-rich applications without spending a fortune. Moreover, it allows developers to deploy their applications on different cloud environments, thus reducing the cost of hosting.\nDevelopers need to adhere to the licensing requirements of different components used in their applications. Without a proper license management system, tracking the usage of different components is difficult. PaaS simplifies this process by providing a platform for managing the licenses of all required components.\nPaaS provides a one-stop shop for all the required components. It helps developers quickly identify and obtain the necessary licenses for their applications, thus eliminating any unnecessary delays in the development process. It enables developers to easily track the usage of different components in their applications and ensure compliance with the licensing requirements.\n\n","create_date":"2023-02-10T07:26:37+00:00","tag":"","author":"Yashi Mishra"},

A foundational element of this analysis is the recognition of candlestick charts, which illustrate the open, high, low, and closing prices for Bitcoin over specific timeframes. To identify buy or sell signals, you pay attention to patterns such as head and shoulders or triangles, and use indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and moving averages.\nFundamental analysis considers economic factors that influence the cryptocurrency market. It requires examining the underlying forces of market trends, which include market capitalization, news, and regulatory developments. The supply and relevant technology updates are crucial to understanding how value is attributed to Bitcoin.\nBy studying market sentiment and behavior metrics, you can gauge investor sentiment. This involves analyzing news events and social media to understand the mood of the market. Trading volume and market liquidity provide additional insight into how likely a price change can reflect a true market trend.\nAdvanced quantitative analysis tools utilize algorithms, mathematics, and neural networks for a data-driven approach to Bitcoin market analysis. Techniques like time series analysis and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models help unpack market dynamics and anticipate shifts in volatility and liquidity.\nUnderstanding and leveraging market indicators can enhance predictability in Bitcoin trading strategies. A seasoned investor looks closely at trading volume, volatility, and liquidity, as they are significant factors contributing to market stability and efficiency.\nIncorporating analysis into your investment strategies entails considering risks. Risk management is critical, encompassing setting trading strategy, determining entry and exit points, and deciding when to place stop-loss orders to mitigate losses and protect your gains.\nThe blockchain technology underpinning Bitcoin is ever-evolving, introducing new levels of security and efficiency. Staying informed about technological advancements is vital for assessing how these changes can influence your investment strategies and the broader market.\nFinally, integrating comprehensive market analysis into your trading revolves around timing. Utilize a trading platform that aligns with your strategy, allowing you to take advantage of machine learning algorithms to refine your approach for maximum efficiency and profitability. Stay updated with the latest Bitcoin news, analysis, and price predictions to enhance your market awareness.\nMaking informed decisions in Bitcoin investment requires a comprehensive approach that includes market analysis, rigorous risk management, and a clear understanding of market dynamics. By employing these strategies, you stand to better navigate the volatile landscape of cryptocurrencies.\nBefore investing, develop a clear investment thesis that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Examine long-term trends and market demand to assess the viability of Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Consider how decentralized finance (DeFi) might impact the value of Bitcoin and what role digital currencies may play in the broader economy.\nUse technical indicators like moving averages and standard deviation bands to time your entry and exit points effectively. This can help you capitalize on short-term gains while being mindful of market volatility. Strategies like momentum trading can potentially be bolstered by real-time data from crypto exchanges.\nTo mitigate risks, diversify your investments across multiple cryptocurrencies and use portfolio management techniques to adjust allocations based on changing market dynamics. Understanding asset pricing and its relation to market capitalization can inform better risk-adjusted decisions.\nStay informed on regulatory developments in different economies which may affect the market for fiat and digital currencies. External factors such as changes in policy can have significant implications for your trading strategy and the broader cryptocurrency market.\nRegularly review and balance your portfolio to reflect market liquidity and market trends. This may involve rebalancing to maintain a desired level of exposure or to incorporate algorithmic trading methods that can adjust to new information.\nDecide whether to focus on long-term trends or to leverage short-term gains. Long-term strategies may involve holding assets through market volatility, while short-term strategies often require responsiveness to real-time analysis for quick decision making.\nLeverage tools for real-time analysis to make informed decisions amidst market manipulation threats and sudden changes in market demand. Advanced platforms and analytical models can improve responsiveness to market conditions, enabling better execution of your investment strategies.\nIn leveraging market analysis for Bitcoin investments, you gain the foresight to navigate the cryptocurrency market with greater confidence. By incorporating techniques from technical analysis, you can decipher market trends and make strategic entry and exit decisions. Additionally, combining these methods with fundamental and quantitative analysis arms you with a comprehensive understanding of underlying market drivers. This approach enables you to make informed decisions tailored to your investment goals.\n\n","create_date":"2024-05-13T12:14:49+00:00","tag":"","author":"Jack"},

Albayrak explains in a reddit post that he purchased a iMac and created a blockchain wallet so that he could transfer his funds from the hardware wallet.\nAfter setting up his wallet, he went on a vacation and when he came back people complained his iMac was too big and took a lot of space. When he went to exchange it for a MacBook, the representatives said they don‚Äôt do exchanges and he needs to return the iMac first.\nThe employee told him that only 4 hours were left as the company‚Äôs 15-day policy was about to expire. He rushed to return his iMac without backing up the password and seed.\nAlbayrak explains\nMy wallet was newly transferred onto a Blockchain wallet created on the iMac after I had an incident with an offline wallet and got scared. I used [an] auto generate password by Apple with no iCloud to backup the keychain. When creating [the password], I took a screenshot on the iMac of the recovery phrase which is also now gone.\nAfter returning the iMac and going home, he realized at night that he had just returned the computer without transferring the screenshot of his generated password to a device or email which he could still access. He then called Apple to see if someone could support him with this.\nAlbayrak also said he went to back to the store (where he had returned the iMac) 2 hours before it opened to hopefully catch the delivery van, which usually takes the products back to China where they are manufactured. However, after not being able to track down the delivery van, Albayrak entered the store and asked the manager if his computer was still there.\n\nThe computer was still a part of standard return policy procedures, the iMac‚Äôs hard drive had been formatted, meaning that recovery phrase and password were gone.\n\n\nBeing Cathartic and also reminding people it‚Äôs imperative to properly backup wallets, he wrote:\nIt‚Äôs not a joke. You don‚Äôt realize sh*t happens until it happens don‚Äôt be that guy in my position. Please copy your backup codes and secure your wallet ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not a good feeling. It‚Äôs not even about losing 170K ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about losing a wallet with that much money in BTC. It‚Äôs there but you cannot use it. When I start seeing the price go up is when it‚Äôs going to piss me off.\nInterestingly, he has offered a 40% reward to help him find a way in which he can restore his wallet.\n\n","create_date":"2018-12-09T17:05:08+00:00","tag":"","author":"Kesarwani"},

Each sticks to its argument and provides evidence. The POKT team publicly slandered Hotbit for selling fake coins, and claimed that the Hotbit exchange independently launched POKT token without reaching a cooperation agreement with Pocket Network; Hotbit Exchange listed on the official website the details and process of the POKT team‚Äôs shortfall of 2,461,317 POKT on the Hotbit platform due to the provision of defective documents and block browsers, and pointed out a series of unavoidable problems existed in POKT team currently. The two sides also responded to the incident on their respective official websites, the detailed responses can be accessed at the following links:\nReport from HotbitÔºöhttps://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419589904407\nResponse from POKT: https://www.blog.POKT.network/the-road-to-getting-POKT-officially-listed-on-exchanges-and-navigating-exchanges-who-are-not-supported-by-pocket-network/\nI believe everyone can distinguish the right and wrong of the two. In fact, Hotbit‚Äôs response is relatively objective and well-founded, but POKT‚Äôs response seems to be a bit groundless. Let‚Äôs sort it out together:\nFirst, let‚Äôs talk about ‚Äúselling fake coins‚Äù. The POKT team does not have enough evidence to show that the POKT on the Hotbit platform is fake, and the so-called ‚Äúfake coins‚Äù is just one side of the story. On the contrary, even if the Hotbit platform has listed POKT tokens due to the popularity of POKT, it is a free publicity for POKT. In the encryption field where traffic is money, the listing of a certain token on the exchange is actually a timely support for the start-up team of the project. After the popularity of POKT, it not only did not give a favor to Hotbit, but turned about and hit it with a rake instead, which is unkind.\nSecond, judging from the public response, the POKT team actually admitted that it provided defective documentation and a buggy browser. Then, it is reasonable to take the initiative to take responsibility for the subsequent series of problems, rather than be evasive and reckless;\nThird, DAO is a great governance tool and a hot new track in the blockchain field. The development of this track provides fertile soil and broad space for the development of decentralization. However, this shouldn‚Äôt be a tool for unscrupulous teams to shift blame and avoid problems. How could they look after their own interests and pass the buck to the DAO community? I believe that people in the entire encryption field will not agree to such an approach for it not only distorts the meaning of DAO‚Äôs existence, but also hurts countless developers and users of DAO. DAO should be the inheritor and promoter of the concept of decentralization, instead of a tool for doing evil and evading responsibility;\nFourth, POKT claims to be ‚Äúone of the top 5 revenue-generating blockchains in the world‚Äù in its recent official statement. I don‚Äôt know how Pocket Network can be so confident. It might work on novice who are hustled in the currency circle, but where are the places for chains like ETH, BSC, SOL, LUNA, AVAX, MATIC, FTM, CRO and NEAR? Could it be that five of these nine chains ranked actually after Pocket Network? In short, I have not see that the Pocket Network chain is the top five in the world on any query tool. I don‚Äôt know if the POKT team forgot to type ‚Äúhundred‚Äù or ‚Äúten‚Äù after ‚Äúfive‚Äù;\nFifth, in addition to the above, the Pocket Network team itself has some ‚Äúfake‚Äù problems. For example, its official Twitter shows 27,000 followers, but some of its official Tweets has only a few responses (a few likes, 0 comments), which doesn‚Äôt match the 27,000 followers. For example, the Tweet on January 27 has 12 retweets, 34 likes, and 0 replies, this is one of the top five blockchain projects in the world with 27,000 followers? How could it be?\nSixth, the encryption field has always advocated the concept of decentralization. I don‚Äôt know if POKT is a supporter of decentralization, but some of its practices have actually violated this industry spirit if it is. In addition, Hotbit integration, in accordance with the decentralized spirit of blockchain, does not require POKT license. Moreover, there is currently no original and complex information on this POKT chain, which is claimed to be the top five in the world. If POKT is not a supporter of the spirit of decentralization, don‚Äôt use the concept of DAO to show off its IQ. In fact, this has exposed a very big problem, which is worth discussing and thinking deeply.\nThere is still a lot of evidence shows the POKT team has violated the facts, if Pocket Network has been dealing with problems with such an attitude of disregarding the facts and evading responsibility, I am afraid that the problems will only emerge one after another, and ultimately cannot be properly solved, and those who are hurt can only be the users and the user‚Äôs trust in POKT. In fact, the industry is still in the early stage of development, and any problems are inevitable. Problems are not terrible, and followers and explorers of the industry should have a problem-solving attitude, stand with users, and solve problems together. As long as you show a sincere attitude and face the pain points of the problem, I believe that users and industry professionals can forgive you.\nBut if you go your own way and try to cover up facts, you may bring ruin upon yourself and bite your tongue off.\nRelated Links:\nHotbit stops POKT deposit& withdrawal /transaction announcement link https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4417971601815\nLinks to Technical Analysis Documentation https://docs.google.com/document/d/16nM5rbQ46I3M_rjOWg6CUZfdCAthuxQGNg86e14h8o8/edit?usp=sharing\nFake tx documentation link https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ajaTUicGP7GG47KdW7jfM1SOs9_e1b6P-ICH0Zkr-E/edit?usp=sharing\nPOKT DAO Forum link https://gov.pokt.network/\nPOKT Twitter Link\nTweets by POKTnetwork\n\nPOKT Discord Link https://discord.com/invite/uYs6Esum3r\nPOKT Tg Link https://t.me/POKTnetwork\nUS SEC reporting link https://www.sec.gov/\nHow to import your order history https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010088313-\n\n","create_date":"2022-01-31T04:01:53+00:00","tag":"","author":"Mohamad Ahmad"},

The corporations have come up with a consent management system which they drive via blockchain. The new management system is meant for the healthcare industry. Both of the companies announced the management system in a press release. And Cointelegraph, the cryptocurrency and blockchain media outlet was an integral part of the press release.\nThe press release came into being to address the ongoing issues that arise with conventional user consent management. The consent management plays a crucial role in continuoual future research endeavors. The new product will create compliance between the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, General Data Protection Regulation. In the second place, the crucial element of the new product line wants to streamline the collection of medical research data.\nThe consent management system is going to take stalk of collecting the data. Then consent management system will wait for the data and the updates until they are done with the collecting. The user consent management will keep the record of the data on the blockchain of ExonumTM. As a blockchain, ExonumTM is going to record the date and time of the records which proceeds to the blockchain. Then the recorded data can be used for the future surveys of the healthcare industry.\nBy the looks of it, the solution would work as a complete system for managing data. On the other hand, the users will utilize the digital systems for storing their consent.\nCEO of Insilico Medicine, Alex Zhavoronkov said that the regulations of blockchain and cryptocurrency vary from places to places. And this is calling forward the need for the organizational researches to deploy the groundbreaking content management systems. With the help of content management system protecting the data of the owners will become the top-most priority.\nThe content management system is much more promising than the regulations on blockchain around the world. The procedure of the content, on the other hand, is rapid, free, universal as well as cost-effective. In the medical industry, protecting the patients is the top-most priority.\nThe medical institutions have to make the patients educated and keep them protected. When it comes to cyber attacks on a blockchain network, the attacks are impossible to take place. By the looks of it, the blockchain networks are incredibly secure.\nHence, the medical institutions want to use blockchain to keep the privacy and the security of the patients intact.\nBack in February 2019, Medical Diagnostic Web and Bitfury came into a partnership agreement. Medical Diagnostic Web is a favorite radiology blockchain marketplace. MDW and Bitfury came together to create an ecosystem for the medical image with the help of blockchain technology. Bitfury‚Äôs Longenesis & MDW will curate a secure and sharing platform for diagnostic information like X-rays, CT scans and medical imaging.\nBlockchain technology is the best option for the medical organization who want to adopt electronic health information. Ministry of Science & ICT of South Korea came together with Seoul Medical Center to develop a project called ‚ÄúSmart Hospital.‚Äù The project aims to improve the accuracy of the data. As a result, the collaboration will reduce the processing time for Seoul Medical Center.\n","create_date":"2019-04-05T19:16:08+00:00","tag":"","author":"Kesarwani"},

It eventually became the third largest cloud service in the world","title":"Alibaba to Launch its Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) Globally","content":" China has never been a big fan of cryptocurrencies but the scenario is quite different when it comes to Blockchain. The country has been the leading innovator in Blockchain technology with new projects shaping the technical landscape in Blockchain every day. The government is employing the technology to its sectors and even the Central Bank is ready with arms open wide to embrace Blockchain and utilize it in its day to day activities.\nThe Chinese retail giant Alibaba first started its Alibaba Cloud services in 2009. It eventually became the third largest cloud service in the world. In China, Alibaba Cloud is the biggest cloud service platform. After working in the Blockchain and the company utilizing its Ant Blockchain, they are planning on going global.\nThe Alibaba Blockchain-as-a-service product will be spread to the rest of Asia, U.S., and Europe. They plan on launching the product in 19 regions with the assistance of 52 of the company‚Äôs data centers. In China itself, the product was launched last year in October.\nThe Blockchain-as-a-service product will allow its clients to utilise the services of Alibaba BaaS in order to develop or create Blockchain based products. Organisations and corporate can build and host their own Blockchain products which are mainly smart contracts and apps. According to Alibaba, what they offer is:\n‚ÄúAn enterprise-level platform service based on leading blockchain technologies [that] helps customers builds a secure and stable environment for blockchain implementations.‚Äù\nLooking at the technical aspects of the products, it utilises company‚Äôs Ant Blockchain along with IBM‚Äôs Hyperledger Fabric technology. Confidence is fostered as IBM is already doing some impressive work in the distributed ledger technology space. They are partnering up with major companies, retailers, and even federal agencies either directly or through platforms.\nAlibaba is aiming to form a ‚Äòtrust infrastructure‚Äô that empowers innovations across all industries and the product is ‚Äúguarded by trusted computing and a secure consortium blockchain network‚Äù. The Intel SGX will be used as security technology to protect both code and data from cyber-attacks. The platform will support consortium blockchain management, EDCCs (aka smart contracts), and software development kit (SDK) applications, as well as automatic deployment and monitoring, operating, and maintenance functions.\nWhat Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger‚Äôs executive director had to say is:\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delighted to see the launch of Alibaba Cloud BaaS powered by Hyperledger Fabric as we‚Äôve already seen many Hyperledger use cases in production this year.‚Äù\nHe also hopes that this expansion will bring ‚Äúmore exciting innovations to the global blockchain communities‚Äù. On an additional note, he stated that ‚Äú2018 is set to be another blockbuster year for the industry‚Äù.\nAccording to Alibaba, Blockchain have immense utility in services which require record keeping such as healthcare and supply chain management. Many of the BaaS developed apps using the product were created for the same industries and purposes. The company is now expanding to UK. According to Alibaba Cloud‚Äôs EMEA general manager, Yeming Wang, BaaS will employ ‚ÄúAI-powered and data-driven technology‚Äù that will allow the company to offer services ranging from ‚Äúmachine learning capabilities to predictive data analytics‚Äù.\nThe major competitors of Alibaba in the global cloud BaaS marketplace are Microsoft Azure, Oracle, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), which launched its Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric templates and blockchain ecosystem in April. This week, news cited that Parity Technologies has revealed that its Blockchain-building platform called Substrate will be ready for developers for use in November.\nThe BaaS market is growing rapidly and for the same reason a Bank of America analyst, Kash Rangan, recently predicted that it could quickly reach a value of $7 billion. The companies are always on the lookout for cost-effective blockchain solutions and these emerging new ventures are being developed to cater to these needs.\n","create_date":"2018-10-27T13:11:09+00:00","tag":"","author":"Kesarwani"},

And this is the first time","title":"China makes the right call on the Cryptocurrency - TheCryptoUpdates","content":" It was only the previous week that the world came to know that China sports 70% of the cryptocurrency mining. Also read: China Signals to Give a Fresh Blow to Crypto-Mining Industries. And this is the first time China has come up with something that is extremely surprising to the Cryptocurrency industry. According to the sources, as well as the officials, the Chinese are making plans to ban the cryptocurrency mining activity.\nThe National Development & Reform Commission of China will announce the elimination, promotion, and restriction of mining activity of cryptocurrency. The management of the microeconomic agency said that they currently lack the minimal conditions for safe production. By the looks of it, the agency also said that mining cryptocurrency is a sheer waste for the country‚Äôs resources. On the other hand, they are excruciatingly harmful to the earth‚Äôs environment, most importantly the country.\nIt is true that the mining of cryptocurrency needs a tremendous amount of electricity. Most of the companies which are into cryptocurrency mining are located in the provinces which depend on coal. Mostly because, in the coal-dependent areas, the energy is incredibly cheaper. By the looks of it, the cryptocurrency mining generates around three to 15 ton of CO2 every year. For a long time now, the Asian country has not met the required goals to conserve the environment. Nevertheless, it is finally a good thing that the Chinese authority took the right decision to ditch cryptocurrency mining.\nBack in 2017, in September, China also made bans to the Initial Coin Offering. China also said that the Initial Coin Offerings acts as the decentralized marker which is open to fraudulent activities. Due to the ban, around 88 of the Initial Coin Offering exchange platforms were put to an end.\nAround 85 of the ICO projects were also put to rest by the Chinese officials and the government. Measuring the Initial Coin Offerings is extremely easy; nevertheless, it requires a massive jolt of electricity. The cryptocurrency mining activity is often easier when it comes to locating them.\nThe reason as to why China chose to ban the cryptocurrency mining activity is that they are nothing but wastage of energy. On the other hand, most of the hype of the cryptocurrency is wavering off. Some of the most potent spectators around the world are targeting the cryptocurrencies.\nThe cryptocurrencies are relatively useless for exchanging of the goods or services due to its pre-existing economics. Moreover, the companies who were obtaining the cryptocurrency along with the patents from the Bank of America are making changes. These companies are slowing down the level of developments and on the other hand, are getting incredibly sceptical.\nBoth blockchain and cryptocurrency have an incredible consensus algorithm. For a long time now, both blockchain and cryptocurrency have promised overall security which was never fulfilled. Most of the time, even the most decentralized mechanisms are vulnerable. There is a highly likely chance that they would break too.\nIn the present day scenario, both cryptocurrencies and blockchain are extremely promising. Nevertheless, using the cryptocurrency and blockchain are problematic. And this is where Vitalik Buterin‚Äôs scheme of replacing PoW with PoS will benefit the users.\n","create_date":"2019-04-15T12:11:37+00:00","tag":"","author":"Kesarwani"},

He further said that sometimes things are never as good as they look ad never as bad as they seem.\nAsif also believes that the crypto market has experienced more innovation in the past one year which surpassed everything from the last few years. According to Coinbase President, cryptocurrencies are getting more visible and the use cases are getting stronger.

And Steemit, the blockchain social network shedding 70 percent of its workforce, quoting the downfall of the crypto market.\nMany crypto exchanges have also been struggling with the drained volumes while the crypto market experienced huge selloffs from the worried investors. However, in all this mayhem, Coinbase continued to roll out products upgrades with its 12 Days of Coinbase initiative, where it vows to announce an update of a product on its blog for twelve days.\nAs per the 12 Day initiative, Coinbase has recently added a new product feature like the Coinbase Earn and the Crypto Convert. And it also has listed some new coins to its platform, which led to conjecture that the exchange is reportedly trying to surge its trading volumes by adding more cryptos for trading.\nAsif while speaking on this speculation, explained that there are hundreds and thousands of cryptocurrencies out there and the exchange in the coming years will add as many cryptos as it can. He further said this is the start of a great wave of technology, and one can expect to see more and more cryptos over the time.\nThe Coinbase honcho while speaking about the growth of Coinbase‚Äôs institutional products, said that the institutions require a compliant and regulated venue to invest in cryptos. And he also said that there has been an uptick of the onboarding of institutions into the exchange‚Äôs custody products.\nHe then went on to say that they have built a lot of liquidity and have the best regulated and most qualified custodian in the space. Asif concluded by saying that they have built a lot of infrastructures to let the institutions to invest in crypto products.\n","create_date":"2018-12-22T07:06:07+00:00","tag":"","author":"Kesarwani"},

A non-fungible token (NFT) was requested by Chancellor Rishi Sunak to be distributed this summer.\nStablecoins, according to a Treasury news release, might be a useful payment system that gives consumers additional options.\nFollowing an investigation into the influence of different crypto assets on the banking system, the UK government said that stablecoins may offer a more efficient form of payment and broaden customer choice.\nStablecoins will be better managed in the UK if e-money regulation is updated.

Recent years have seen the rise not just of digitized transaction methods, but also digital currency. Thus, if you‚Äôre still relatively young with some money to burn, you might find it worthwhile to invest in cryptocurrency. Just like the usual stock market, you can speculate on the value of altcoins in an exchange and realize a hefty gain.\nHowever, as the saying goes, the bigger the gain, the higher the risk. Whether you‚Äôre a newcomer to the world of investments or a seasoned stock trader, it‚Äôs necessary to understand the risks and benefits of trading digital currency before putting even a single cent on the table. In this article, we‚Äôve compiled a list of the most relevant crypto pros and cons to help you make smart investments.\nCrypto Pros\nHigh Security\nNow that more people have begun to do business online, cybersecurity has become a paramount concern for businesses and customers alike. The blockchain technology that most crypto is founded on makes use of extremely complex encryption techniques to protect traders and their transaction information. Many crypto exchanges and reputable third-party providers also offer the option to store and trade coins from highly secure digital wallets. For instance, if you plan on trading in Monero, you might want to consider getting a dedicated XMR Wallet to make secure transactions and to safely store your coins. Lastly, the majority of crypto transactions take place under pseudonyms for an added layer of user protection.\nDecentralized Value\nOne of the hottest selling points of crypto is that it isn‚Äôt regulated by external institutions like banks or governments. Some crypto backers argue, for instance, that this decentralization protects digital currencies from inflation.\nInstead of being controlled by regulatory bodies, crypto‚Äôs value is determined primarily by the majority of users who own the coins. How much crypto is produced and how it is valued grows as supply and demand increase. That is, as more people make use of a particular cryptocurrency and more businesses accept it as a mode of payment, the higher that currency‚Äôs value is expected to rise.\nOne-to-One Transactions\nTraditional business transactions most often require a middleman‚Äîsay, a bank, a trading company, or a broker. Whatever the specific nature of the transaction, the presence of this middleman often introduces additional expenses and complicated paperwork to the process. Cryptocurrency transactions, on the other hand, are a simple, private one-on-one exchange between buyer and seller. On the whole, such transactions promise less confusion, lower transaction fees, and overall greater accountability.\nNo Market Hours\nThe cryptocurrency market, unlike the traditional stock market, does not adhere to any particular trading hours. Traders who invest in crypto have the convenience of being able to buy and sell coins at any time of day, any day of the week.\nCrypto Cons\nHard for New Investors to Understand\nThe language around cryptocurrency is frequently riddled with technical and industry jargon. Because the technology is so complex, potential investors have to do a significant amount of research in order to invest intelligently and minimize losses. The difficulty of understanding and navigating digital currency, coupled with the relative simplicity of cash, can often deter newcomers from investing in crypto.\nVolatile Market\nBecause the value of crypto depends heavily on market activity, the cryptocurrency market often sees rapid gains and losses over relatively short periods of time. Unfavorable changes in the business environment, such as tax hikes and policy changes by companies, often cause sharp market downturns in just one day. Should booming businesses elect not to accept digital currency, for example, crypto prices can drop dramatically, leading to immediate losses of billions of dollars in value.\nLegal Complications\nThe decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, for all its benefits, also comes with its own set of difficulties, particularly when it comes to legality. Central governments and national banks, though they don‚Äôt regulate crypto, retain the authority to recognize it as a legitimate mode of payment. Hence, whether or not operational businesses within a particular country can even accept crypto payments still depends on these entities. The national government of Turkey, for instance, recently elected to ban all crypto payments in light of the Turkish currency crisis. This led to the collapse of multiple crypto exchanges and around $2 billion in losses for investors.\nPotentially Exploitable for Criminal Activities\nFor all that blockchain technology has frequently been touted as ‚Äúunhackable,‚Äù the truth is any information stored online remains vulnerable to hacking. Dedicated and accomplished hackers study security technology at length in order to better exploit loopholes in its systems. No matter how sophisticated the technology used to protect your digital assets, a cybercriminal with enough know-how might therefore still be able to seize them.\nLikewise, the decentralization of crypto also makes it an appealing resource for scammers. Because there are no supervisory institutions monitoring the production of crypto, it‚Äôs relatively simple for fraudulent developers to produce fake coins. They can then use these coins to rope unwitting investors into Ponzi schemes or similar scams.\nWhen all is said and done at the end of the day, the question remains: should you invest in crypto? The answer depends in large part on how well you understand the risks and whether you think you can handle them. As with traditional investments, it‚Äôs important to read up at length on what you‚Äôre investing in. It would also be wise to pool together an emergency fund to cushion you financially in an emergency. Once you‚Äôve equipped yourself with the necessary knowledge and financial safeguards, you‚Äôll be that much more in control of any money you elect to invest.\n","create_date":"2021-11-19T07:30:52+00:00","tag":"","author":"Mohamad Ahmad"},

Nevertheless, to leverage the power of this decentralized currency, you need the right strategies and an understanding of the cryptocurrency market. Here, we look at five ways to make money with Bitcoin.\nThe blockchain technology upon which Bitcoin was established relies on complicated mathematical equations to verify each transaction. By learning how to mine Bitcoin, you will be rewarded for every block of transaction you help complete. Bear in mind that crypto mining has become complicated over the years, and you will need to invest in powerful computing equipment to support these processes. Most importantly, you will need to join mining pools and clouds for a better fighting chance and assurance of regular earnings.\nThe highly volatile nature of Bitcoin means that its price can rise and fall dramatically, providing a channel for utilizing these short-term opportunities. However, before you get into Bitcoin trading, it is vital to acquire proper technical and analytical skills to better grasp how the market operates and its trading opportunities. You will also need to develop a trading strategy that best works for you, and some of the popular options to consider are:\nOne of the oldest strategies investors use to earn from different assets is the buy and hold method. Here, you get to buy and hold onto Bitcoin for as long as possible while waiting for the prices to rise before you sell your holdings. Keep in mind that this could mean waiting for weeks, months, or years before the price hits the highs you desire.\nToday, many Bitcoin affiliate programs allow you to earn once you successfully bring in new customers. Essentially, you will be promoting Bitcoin and related products to your followers, friends, and family as you receive a decent commission from your links. Another closely related method that you can leverage if you are knowledgeable about the blockchain world is to run a blogging platform and earn from sponsored posts.\nSeveral exchanges support crypto lending, where you get to loan out your Bitcoin holdings for an agreed-upon interest rate after a specific period. Since lending comes with its risks, it is vital to stick to credible lending platforms that have policies to guarantee your earnings.\nWhile Bitcoin is not a source of easy money, strategically investing in these assets could turn out to be a lucrative venture for you.\n\n\n","create_date":"2022-01-21T13:17:59+00:00","tag":"","author":"Jack"},

As per a report on Thursday","title":"German Automaker, Volkswagen to Use Blockchain Technology","content":" German Automaker, Volkswagen group announces that it will use blockchain to track its mineral supply chains. As per a report on Thursday, the company joins open industry collaboration. It will also include Ford as one of the members.\nThe automaker makes a move to source its minerals like cobalt responsibly. As a matter of fact, car companies use cobalt in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles.\nPresently, consumer brands and miners rely on third-party audits. In addition to it, they also rely on laborious manual processes. It is to comply with industry standards which people accept. To source minerals, companies use these processes.\nSimilarly, with the use of blockchain technology, it is easier to track supply chains. It will also help industries to meet responsible sourcing. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or OECD sets some standards that companies must follow. They also have to provide a record of mineral movements. It is to aid the process of compliance with permanent records.\nVolkswagen, therefore, is going to use a new platform that has permission from authorities. Reportedly, the group on IBM Blockchain develops the platform. They will build it using Hyper-ledger Fabric. This type of platform will be able to track minerals across global supply chains.\nEarlier this year, the formation of the collaboration took place. It will include many members of the collaboration. For instance, companies like LG Chem, Huayou, and RCS are a part of the collaboration. Interestingly, LG Chem is a unit of South Korean conglomerate of LG Corp. And, RCS is a raw material auditing firm.\nSimilarly, Volkswagen announces the matter. According to the automaker, participants in the network can securely contribute data. They can also get access to immutable data with permission. Further, the participants can do these activities to keep a record of the flow of materials across their supply chain. Volkswagen says that RCS Global Group will validate compliance with responsible sourcing standards. The participants can be able to trace the supply chain in real time.\nAccording to IBM‚Äôs recent blog, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has over 60% of global production of cobalt. Unfortunately, around 2 million miners deal with various challenges in this area. It also includes violations of human rights. Also, some cobalt mines force child labor to carry out work.\nFurthermore, the German automaker says that it aims to expand the membership to various other industries. It will include industries, like aerospace, mining operations, and consumer electronics shortly.\nMoreover, as per the press release of the company, Volkswagen has eyes on the provenance of minerals. It says the collaboration will allow the Volkswagen Group to have a broader view of the provenance of minerals.\nHowever, with the collaboration‚Äôs aim to responsibly source cobalt, it has bracer significance. Cobalt integrates with a range of devices and has become a necessity. The devices, for instance, smartphones, cars, etc. use cobalt. It also features in a variety of other consumer products.\n\nRead Also: IBM Announces Blockchain Platform Launch in Melbourne\n","create_date":"2019-04-22T07:29:02+00:00","tag":"","author":"Kesarwani"},

Cryptocurrencies are the best-known application of blockchain, but that is only one thing that can be done with the tech. Many of the other potential applications of blockchain could be of enormous benefit to the healthcare industry. Below are some of the ways that blockchain might achieve this.\nOne of the biggest challenges that the healthcare industry faces is maintaining full and accurate patient records. Not only do individual institutions need to be able to maintain these records, but they also need to be able to reliably share them amongst themselves. For example, if a patient is treated in a hospital in one part of the country, and then six months later is again treated on the other side of the country, they expect their medical records to be easily available to the second doctor.\nHealthcare institutions don‚Äôt just need a reliable way of sending information between themselves, but a reliable way of ascertaining whether that information is accurate or not. Blockchain presents them with a potential solution to this problem because of its immutability. In other words, once information has been recorded on the blockchain, it is then virtually impossible to change again.\nThe number of industries interested in introducing blockchain because of the impact it can have is rising, and the healthcare industry is no exception to this.\nAn aging and growing population is presenting significant challenges for the American healthcare industry. In fact, all across the world, healthcare systems are now shouldering an increased burden due to shifting population demographics.\nIn order to rise to the challenges that this demographic shift represents, healthcare systems need to find ways of making their available resources stretch further than ever before. To that end, anything that can be done to reduce operating costs is worth pursuing.\nBlockchain can enable significant savings for entire healthcare systems by enabling more accurate auditing. Supply chain auditing is one of the most important potential applications of blockchain technology, and could potentially transform a number of fields, including the pharmaceutical industry.\nIn the future, digital healthcare companies could derive a significant portion of the revenue through health-related cryptocurrencies. There are already a few nascent efforts at producing such coins, with varying degrees of success.\nFor example, Sweatcoin tracks how many steps you take throughout the day, and with every 1000 steps you earn 1 Sweatcoin. These coins can then be used to purchase goods and services from participating retailers.\nProviding cryptocurrency-based incentives for people to live more healthy and active lifestyles is an initiative that will likely appeal to governments around the world. There are therefore likely to be numerous opportunities to make money in this sector in the near future.\nThe healthcare industry is rapidly shifting with the times. Historically, the healthcare system has been more susceptible to advances and changes in technology than other systems, and this is still true today. Many bold claims have been made about the transformative potential of blockchain, not all of which have been realistic. However, the potential that blockchain offers to the healthcare industry is undeniable.\n","create_date":"2020-01-14T07:27:36+00:00","tag":"","author":"Kesarwani"},

Two coins, however, XRP and Solana, seem to be defying the odds and have been rallying, reaching record-high values in the process.\nCould a new, innovative, advanced crypto trading platform RCO Finance (RCOF) catch up with and even topple these coins?\nXRP and Solana (SOL) have been on a once-in-a-lifetime bull run that has questioned the values of competing coins. By market capitalization, Solana (SOL) is currently the 5th largest cryptocurrency in the world. This crypto currently stands at $65,523 billion despite a recent launch date of near 2017.\nTwo numbers below Solana, in 7th place, is another coin currently rallying. XRP‚Äôs current market cap is $28.04 billion, overtaking popular names like DOGE.\nVarious factors drive this rallying in both the XRP and Solana exchanges. Solana, for starters, introduces a unique approach to cryptocurrencies with its lower transaction fees and fostering processing times that make it easy for creators to purchase and own.\nXRP has witnessed gains due to various factors at different times. The coin may benefit from significant buying activities from large investors who are well-known market movers.\nNow to the million-dollar question: ‚Äù What can catch up with the rise of Solana and XRP?‚Äù\n\nFor any coin to compete with the rally Solana (SOL) and XRP is currently experiencing, it must present a disruptive next-generation innovation. Several analysts say this is the case for RCO Finance (RCOF).\nRCO Finance (RCOF), a DeFi trading platform that leverages the power of AI, could enhance the dimensions of crypto trading and exchanges that have not been explored before. Such platform would typically offer the following:\nYou can buy crypto assets, store them, and exchange them for other assets on a single platform. Additionally, you should be able to trade stocks and crypto assets without first converting your virtual assets to any fiat currency.\nA cryptocurrency trading platform that intends to compete with Solana should particularly rival its speed and affordability. It would be even better if that platform is in its initial stage and shows massive potential for rallying.\nThis platform should provide lucrative returns when investors participate in staking pools. A staking pool is a collaborative mechanism in blockchain where investors can merge their resources and earn rewards for creating blocks and validating transactions.\nRCOF is a new crypto platform that uses AI technology for advanced and next-generation trading functionalities. It combines these features with an affordable presale price, which could attract the attention of both veteran and new traders.\nFor more information about the RCO Finance Presale:\nVisit RCO Finance Presale\nJoin The RCO Finance Community\n\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T15:00:35+00:00","tag":"","author":"Jack"},

The move has been made to ‚Äúempower developers‚Äù in the gaming scene.\nTRON ARCADE is expected to garner an investment totaling $100 million over the next three years. Tron as a project has often been criticized for its long-term commitments. But the moves cannot just be ignored as many great undertakings need a bigger time frame to bring results to fruition.\nThe CEO of Tron, Justin Sun, commented that TRON ARCADE will ‚Äúplay a crucial role‚Äù in expanding the popularity of the firm. In his own words:\n‚ÄúTRON strives to tackle existing issues faced by the gaming industry by leveraging the open, transparent, and immutability of blockchain technology‚Ä¶‚Äù\nHe added that:\n‚ÄúTRON Arcade will play a crucial role in encouraging developers to join in our mission and provide the best blockchain gaming experience to users around the world.‚Äù\nThe crypto market is facing a big challenge as prices are falling ruthlessly. Many analysts are already of the view that even though the downfall may stop soon, a move back to previous all-time highs will take a long time. Crypto projects now have the obligation of showing their true worth in terms of the ideas they manifest into reality.\nThe press release was further garnished with statements that highlighted how Tron is better than Ethereum in terms of transaction speed and network scalability. Prior to this announcement, Justin Sun himself continued the PR drive to gravitate Ethereum developers towards the Tron platform.\nEarlier this year, Tron acquired BitTorrent and launched Project Atlas which will integrate torrenting services through BitTorrent. TRON ARCADE is set to revolutionize the gaming industry by shifting game development to the blockchain. Tron was never just about being a transactional currency or store of value like Bitcoin. Tron is working to build a multi-layered decentralized entertainment platform utilizing the TRX currency.

How will these two work on the War4Earth platform? Here‚Äôs how:\nWar4Earth will mint a total of 1,000,000,000 FKD, which is the platform‚Äôs utility token. Distribution of the FKD token will happen at different dates and times, as determined by the platform. War for Earth‚Äôs utility token ‚Äì FKD ‚Äì will be available for use throughout the game‚Äôs ecosystem. It will be used for user interactions and transactions.\nFKD is a BEP-20 token, developed on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. War for Earth expects its FKD to be used by developers, gamers, and players to exchange assets. Additionally, War for Earth expects these same users to build a truly unique experience for gamers via the FKD token.\nHere‚Äôs how Tokenomics break down for the FKD token:\n\nAs you can see, part of the FKD distribution is meant for in-game tokens. These tokens are used for rewards on the War for Earth platform. How can you earn these rewards? Here are a few ways you can add additional FKD to your wallet.\nThe easiest way to earn rewards in War for Earth is to simply play the game. There are also tournaments and PvP games players can participate in as well. Typically, the amount of FKD you earn is directly related to your performance. It stands to reason that if you win, you‚Äôll earn more FKD than if you don‚Äôt.\nAdditionally, there are challenges that offer a specific amount of FKD if you take part. Suffice it to say, by simply being a part of the War4Earth platform, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll earn some FKD rewards.\nStaking allows users to use their FKD to receive rewards through passive income. This can be done via yield farming or revenue sharing, which allows buybacks. Players have the option to put their FKD to work for them and earn either long-term or short-term rewards.\nThose who participate in staking receive rewards for either holding or depositing their FKD. These returns are time-based and calculated based on the amount of time the user stakes them. The longer you stake, the more you‚Äôll earn.\nYou can have your say in War for Earth council elections and more with your FKD tokens. War for Earth uses its FKD tokens to vote for council members, which allows players to have a voice in the direction and development of the platform.\n","create_date":"2022-09-27T16:30:05+00:00","tag":"","author":"Yashi Mishra"},

In a tweet, Hoskinson claimed that the rebellion was a premeditated plan, involving key players such as Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\nHere‚Äôs my hot take on Prigozhin.

Only time will tell which interpretation is more accurate, but one thing is for sure ‚Äì the world is watching and waiting to see what happens next.\nSpeculation has been stirred up by recent statements from Hoskinson, who suggested that the Ukrainian government may have fallen victim to a cunning plan, overcommitting their forces in the east and potentially revealing vulnerabilities that could be exploited.\nIt is worth recalling that the Wagner Group rebelled against the Russian military last June, seizing control of Rostov-on-Don and advancing towards Moscow, but eventually withdrawing forces after negotiations with Belarusian President Lukashenko.\nWhile no concrete evidence has emerged to substantiate the allegations, analysts are pondering the implications of Hoskinson‚Äôs claims. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is a complex web of potential motivations and maneuvers that continue to unfold.\n\nThe allegations surrounding Yevgeny Prigozhin, a trusted confidant of President Putin, have added yet another layer of complexity to an already convoluted situation. Prigozhin, who leads the Wagner Group, a private military contractor, has been linked to a number of controversial activities, further fueling speculation about his involvement.\nMeanwhile, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has been making headlines outside of the cryptocurrency world. His extracurricular activities have caught the attention of the ADA community, with reports emerging that he recently went on an ocean expedition with a team of scientists in search of fragments from an unidentified object that crashed in the Pacific seven years ago. Additionally, Hoskinson announced the grand opening of his family-owned clinic last month.\n","create_date":"2023-06-26T11:31:02+00:00","tag":"","author":"Shivi Verma"},

They are threatening to release 9/11 papers in lieu of a Bitcoin ransom equivalent to $2 million.\nPreviously such an incident was reported as the spokesperson for the Hiscox Group gave affirmation of the hack. He stated that the hackers have managed to gain access to the classified files of a law firm that advised the company. They are supposedly to have litigation files related to the terrorist attack too.\n\nThe group moved to Steemit after being removed from Twitter. For instance, Steemit is a blockchain-based censorship-opposing social media platform. They have received more than 3 Bitcoins from public after their initial announcement. Subsequently, the first ‚Äúlevel‚Äù and a few ‚Äúcheckpoints‚Äù are now publicly presented.\nAlso Read: Lamassu shifts to Switzerland owing to Regulatory Difficulties\nThe 9/11 papers themselves are just the means to extract money and they don‚Äôt actually care about the truth. Namely, the group prefers payment over public release. To summarize, they say:\nConsider our motivations (money, specifically Bitcoin), we‚Äôre not inclined to leak the juiciest items until we‚Äôre paid in full. However, in the interest of public awareness and transparency, we‚Äôre officially announcing our tiered compensation plan.\n\nAccording to their statement via a blog post explains the pricing proposal:\nPreview_Documents.container ‚Äì Free, we released the key to prove authenticity of our claims. Layer_1.container ‚Äì 5.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 1 Documents) Layer_2.container ‚Äì 50.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 2 Documents) Layer_3.container ‚Äì 100.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 2 Documents) Layer_4.container ‚Äì 1.000.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 4 Documents) Layer_5.container ‚Äì 2.000.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 5 Documents)\n\nConsidering 9/11 truth-seeking still being curiously pursued by Americans the official story is not reliable. Likewise, the terrorist attack in New York City and Washington DC marked a defining moment in American history. Thus 9/11 papers are of importance to several people.\nPrevious to 9/11 incident traveling to Canada and Mexico without a passport was relatively easy. Furthermore, the unlocking of Layer 1 was announced yesterday by the group. One‚Äôs out of interest can get the key through their Steemit blog.\nAlso Read: Cabinet of Ireland grants AML Bill affecting Cryptocurrency\nSome of their posts are also least appealing and one user described it in such a manner:\nThis is celebrity garbage, nobody gives two bits of shit about these people ( i have no clue who any of them are) ‚Äì bring the realness.\nAt this point in history, it‚Äôs hard to tell what impact full knowledge of the 9/11 events would have on society. Arguably, by and large our institutions and people have adapted to the change in security culture.\n","create_date":"2019-01-05T06:54:16+00:00","tag":"","author":"Kesarwani"}
