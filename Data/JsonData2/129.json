However, the exchange offers virtually no options for users who want to engage in crypto derivatives contract trading.\nBTCC, on the other hand, is a derivatives-focused digital asset trading platform that lets traders take advantage of futures contracts and turn both negative and positive market moves into potentially lucrative investment opportunities.\nIf you are wondering how to transfer your digital assets from Coinbase to BTCC, look no further – in this article, we are going to highlight the benefits of transferring crypto to BTCC and explain the process of moving crypto from Coinbase to BTCC in a detailed step-by-step guide.\nFounded in 2011, BTCC is one of the pioneers of cryptocurrency trading, enabling digital asset users to engage in digital asset markets via a number of different trading instruments. BTCC allows users to turn a profit while predicting future price movements of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other popular crypto assets.\nBTCC offers perpetual, daily, weekly, and quarterly USDT-denominated futures contracts. In addition, users can take advantage of up to 150x leverage to magnify their exposure to market movements.\nHere are the main benefits of using the BTCC cryptocurrency exchange:\nIf you don’t have an account already registered with BTCC, you can open a new one in just a couple of clicks – simply click on the link below and follow the instructions.\nNew users are greeted with exclusive perks that entail up to 3,500 USDT in rewards when depositing funds to BTCC.

If you already have a part of your portfolio stored on Coinbase, this guide will show you how to move it to BTCC.\nDo note that the steps outlined below showcase the process of transferring crypto from Coinbase to BTCC using each respective exchange’s mobile apps. The process is virtually the same when using desktop clients.\nAfter successfully logging into your BTCC account, click on the “Deposit” button located in the “Assets” menu.\nContinue by choosing your desired deposit digital currency. In this guide, we will be sending Tether (USDT) over the Ethereum network (ERC–20). Keep in mind that selecting the same blockchain network on the deposit and withdrawal platform is paramount. Selecting a different blockchain network can result in a permanent loss of funds.\nClick on the “Copy Address” button to store the blockchain address in the clipboard. If you’ve selected a cryptocurrency that requires additional information to facilitate a transfer, like XRP with its destination tag, copy that information as well.\nLog in to your Coinbase account and withdraw the digital asset you wish to move to the BTCC crypto exchange.\nClick on “Send” on the Coinbase home screen to initiate a crypto transfer.\nSelect the cryptocurrency you wish to transfer from Coinbase to BTCC. As mentioned before, we are using USDT (ERC-20 variant) for the purposes of this guide. After selecting crypto, enter the amount to funds you wish to transfer and click “Continue”.\nPaste the blockchain address you’ve copied from BTCC (see Step 3) and paste it into the dedicated text field. You can store often-used addresses in your contacts lists as well. After making sure the address you’ve pasted is indeed correct, proceed by clicking the “Preview send” button.\nBefore confirming your transfer, you can choose to add an optional note for your recipient. After reviewing the parameters of your transaction, click “Send now” to execute a cryptocurrency transfer.\nNavigate back to the Assets menu in the BTCC app to check whether the funds withdrawn from Coinbase have arrived. Click on the USDT option (or any other supported crypto you’ve transferred) to open “Transaction Details”. Keep in mind that the speed of transactions can vary depending on the level of network congestion, so you might have to wait a couple of minutes before funds are deposited in your BTCC account.\nWith funds available in your BTCC account, you can take advantage of a comprehensive crypto futures trading offering provided by a platform that has been around nearly as long as Bitcoin itself. Hopefully, this article helped you transfer crypto from Coinbase to BTCC, enabling you to turn a profit by predicting future price movements of popular coins and tokens.\nIf you are interested, you can take a look at other similar guides, showing how to transfer crypto to BTCC from Binance US, FTX US, Kraken, and KuCoin:\n","create_date":"2022-09-08T13:08:07+02:00","tag":"BTCC","author":""},

This staggering growth is mirrored by the number of Ethereum validator users, which has doubled over the same period to over 19,000 users. Also, about 400 node operators securing over 568,000 ETH made through them, SSV.Network is on the way to becoming a leader among many others, providing decentralized infrastructure for staking on Ethereum.\nMeanwhile, in 2023, SSV.Network reported that its ecosystem powered by DVT secured $140 million TVL. This development has been fueling its growth and demand for SSV staking solutions.\nSSV.Network recently made one such partnership with Ether.fi, which currently is one of the leading restaking platforms for all things related to Ethereum. This partnership seeks to add another layer of reliability and resilience to the services provided with the two companies working together towards a safe and secure ecosystem.\nEther.fi made its staking operations fully decentralized and increased fault tolerance by adopting distributed validator technology (DVT). By doing so, nodes set up worldwide, make it possible to set up easy and safe stakes while ensuring access to highly performing operators worldwide.\nCommenting on this development, Ether.fi CEO Mike Silgadze said: “Ether.fi has always been focused on making our operations more decentralized and resilient. Our partnership with SSV allows us to continue down that path while maximizing rewards for our users!”\nEther.fi, in the last few weeks, has brought on board close to 2,000 validators using SSV.Network that has led to the instantaneous injection of $200 million into the protocol’s TVL, which is growing at a record rate.\nThis partnership has been productive in many ways, such as improving relay livenesses, increasing overall efficiencies within the protocols and performance enhancements, and strengthening the network. Earlier this month, an SSV cluster that was used by Ether.fi received an 11 ETH MEV block reward.\nThe DVT system is instrumental to securing Ethereum stakes because it eliminates weak points while minimizing the validator’s risks. DVT also ensures that various parties, such as node operators or solo stakers, work together to create an environment that achieves resilience throughout the ecosystem.\nSSV.Network’s recent announcement highlights a significant milestone in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem, achieving a total value locked (TVL) of over $2 billion and doubling its Ethereum validator users. This growth is set to enhance the security and decentralization of Ethereum staking. The collaboration leverages Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) to increase the system’s fault tolerance and efficiency.

Among them, the passage of Proposal 1623 brought substantial progress to rescue the Terra ecosystem by creating a brand new chain and began to airdrop its new tokens to the users of the Terra ecosystem.\nOn May 28, 2022, the genesis block of the new chain was launched to conduct future transactions under the name Terra (LUNA), and the original Terra Chain was rebranded as Terra Classic. The original native token LUNA has also been renamed as LUNA Classic (LUNC). After the tax proposal was released, the price of LUNC increased by 100%.\nThree months ago, MEXC Global initiated another LUNA recovery plan by burning and buying back LUNA as well. Since then, LUNA hit the highest gain of 2,430%.\nWith much support, MEXC Global is the world’s leading cryptocurrency trading platform, providing one-stop cryptocurrency trading services such as Spot, ETF, Futures, Staking, NFT Index, etc., and serves more than 7 million users worldwide.

Starting the year at $44,172, its value hit a record price of $73,135 in March 2024, the highest it has peaked since its onset. This development has got the crypto community excited about the potential of the coin.\nInterestingly, Standard Chartered (STAN) has forecasted Bitcoin will reach $150k by the end of the year., a 50% increase from its initial prediction of $100k. The bank has also predicted that Bitcoin is likely to hit $250k next year before settling at $200k, basing its analysis on the price of gold after gold ETFs were introduced in the US.\nExpectedly, this surge is mostly attributed to the Bitcoin ETF approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January. This saw investors deposit up to $7.35 billion into the 11 different available funds, as reported by Bloomberg.\nThe upside is also linked to its expected halving, which is slated to occur in April 2024. This event aims to reduce the rate of mining new Bitcoins, capping the coin’s total supply at 21 million and driving the crypto’s value. Previously, there have been only three halvings during Bitcoin’s lifespan.\nDuring the course of Bitcoin’s bullish growth, Harambe AI Token presale has been remarkable, soaring past the $6 million mark. Lauded as the first decentralized hedge fund, Harambe AI has set out to revolutionize the crypto scene ever since it launched the presale in December 2023.\nHarambe relaunched its presale in December 2023 with a renewed focus on addressing the unique needs of the younger generation while delivering an extraordinary token. So, the presale is not just a way to build the initial liquidity, but also an approach to building a coin that’s deeply rooted in the dreams of its vibrant community.\nAt the start of the presale, the coins were available at $0.05, allowing users to accumulate as many coins as they wanted. As of 22nd March, investors can get the coins as low as $0.196 per coin, with the price increasing every 48 hours. The price per coin is likely to hit $1 when the token is launched on exchange listings.\nThe Harambe AI project is community-based, so presale offers a way for holders to get involved in the growth of the token. The team behind the project believes the community-first approach is the best way to build a sustainable and widely accepted coin.\nThat’s why they didn’t opt for the traditional route with venture capitalists. By prioritizing active community involvement, the project supports accessibility and inclusivity in the crypto space, broadening the token’s audience and fostering a vibrant community.\nThe success of the presale also shows the growing investor interest in the project, allowing investors to participate in a project set to redefine decentralized finance (DeFi). With the goal of selling 30% of the total supply through the presale, Harambe AI is well on track to achieve it.\nHarambe AI also believes that its community will help to democratize the benefits of AI trading. The project’s outlined plans have various initiatives aimed at benefiting its community, such as rewards and bonuses to attract new participants and encourage greater involvement.\nUnlike the typical meme coins in the crypto scene, Harambe AI Token is an innovative project bent on redefining how crypto investors trade. The project uses an AI trading bot to trade on behalf of token holders, and it’s built on the ERC-20 platform to ensure transparent and tamper-proof trading records.\nThe bot handles every aspect of trading, from executing strategies to seizing opportunities to drive revenues. In this case, token holders don’t need to do anything once they have purchased the coins. They just need to hold the coins and watch their value increase. Additionally, they also share in the profits the bot makes from trading top coins like Bitcoin.\nWith its AI-driven hedge fund system, Harambe AI offers a pioneering approach within the crypto space. The project unifies blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, delivering a sophisticated investment vehicle that reshapes traditional paradigms. It uses a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, which is specifically designed for financial trading.\nThe AI trading bot uses a buy-back and burn mechanism to purchase its own from the market. This results in reduced supply in the market, fueling demand and driving token prices. Early holders are sure of guaranteed profits through this self-sustaining program.\nNote that the bot trades 24/7 based on the current market dynamics, shifts, and trends. It was trained on historical crypto data and seeks to outperform emotionally driven human trading strategies. It also continuously updates its knowledge using real-time data, enhancing its ability to make buy, sell, or hold decisions.\nThe Harambe Token has achieved a significant milestone in cryptocurrency, and this massive feat is a testament to the increasing interest in alternative investment vehicles. The project aspires to a transformative future, with several objectives in sight, including AI democratization, integrations, and collaborative development.\nHarambe AI hopes to make this a reality by ensuring AI crypto trading is accessible to all individuals, regardless of their trading and financial background. It aims to offer educational programs and support community involvement to make sure its community is up-to-date about the token and the broader crypto scene.\nThe project also has plans for expansions through strategic partnerships, collaborative developments, and third-party integrations. All these efforts are geared toward enhancing Harambe Token, expanding its outreach, and making it a trustworthy investment vehicle for traders and investors.\nApart from trading, Harambe Token aims to provide other financial products like predictive analytics and asset management. Today’s crypto market looks positive, with new players like Harambe AI offering traders and investors innovative ways to trade. With this vision, the future seems to hold exciting opportunities and possibilities.\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions presented in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinCheckup.

BTC/USD lost nearly 5% of its value in the last 24 hours and dropped to $18,578.\nThe reason for the sudden drop in the price of BTC, and the majority of other digital assets, likely lies primarily in investors’ anxiety over an upcoming speech from the Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman Jerome Powell, and a press conference by the European Central Bank (ECB). Both events are slated to take place on Thursday.\nFollowing two consecutive 75 basis points rate hikes in June and July in the US, it is widely believed ECB could be following its American counterparts in employing restrictive monetary measures in a fight against inflation. The eurozone is currently experiencing record inflation of 9.7%, with the rate expected to increase to double digits in the coming months.\nBoth the US and the EU officials are expected to keep raising interest rates until inflation subsidies. Last month, the Fed released a report saying the restrictive monetary policy would probably continue for the better half of 2023.\nOn top of growing interest rates, the strength of the US Dollar reached a twenty-year high earlier this week. DXY, an index tracking the performance of the USD against a basket of major fiat currencies, hit 110 points on Tuesday.\nHistorically speaking, both the strong dollar and interest rate hikes have demonstrated to be clear bearish signs for Bitcoin.\nDespite the bearish medium-term outlook, a prominent BTC analyst with over 500k Twitter followers, “il Capo of Crypto”, believes Bitcoin could bounce to $22,500–$23,000. “Price is right now sitting above major daily support (range low, 18500-19000). It’s where the last bear market rally started, indicating there’s strong demand here,” wrote the analyst.\n$BTC First of all, price is right now sitting above major daily support (range low, 18500-19000). It's where the last bear market rally started, indicating there's strong demand here. A bounce from here to the supply zone (22500-23000) would form a perfect H&S. https://t.co/kFxIg0gnLW pic.twitter.com/J2o1uCzkxt\nHowever, despite the potential surge, il Capo thinks Bitcoin will reach new lows going forward.\nAccording to our automatic BTC price predictions, the world’s largest crypto could form a rally towards the end of the year, and post new 12-month+ highs in early 2023.\n","create_date":"2022-09-07T16:11:23+02:00","tag":"Bitcoin","author":""},

Blocksquare's innovative platform democratizes real estate, allowing community participation and fostering local economic growth through fractional ownership. Learn how tokenization empowers communities and promotes a more inclusive economic landscape.","title":"Building Inclusive Communities: How Real Estate Tokenization Empowers and Transforms - CoinCheckup","content":" The tokenization of real estate is the process of dividing property ownership into digital shares known as tokens using blockchain technology. Unlike conventional real estate investing, this approach often requires large sums of money and intricate procedures. Tokenization allows for the ownership of small portions of a property, enabling more individuals to invest.\nThe real estate market is more fluid, and purchasing and selling these shares is easier. This strategy may assist in dispersing wealth among communities equally and make property investment more accessible.\nBlocksquare is one platform that provides a blockchain system intended to tokenize commercial real estate, opening up markets usually dominated by bigger firms to smaller investors.\nTokenization involves local communities in the investing process, therefore altering property ownership. Because it reduces the often large entrance fees, community residents may invest less money in local real estate.\nBeyond just financial gain, this engagement fosters a feeling of ownership and interest in the growth and welfare of the community. Having a direct interest in the prosperity of their neighborhood, citizens who become investors are more likely to assume more accountability for common assets.\nTokenization will majorly affect fair investment possibilities and local economic prosperity. Neighborhoods may be regenerated, and economic activity rises as more individuals make investments in their surroundings. Not only investors may gain from this since improved property care, new projects, and increased property prices might result. Moreover, more equitable distribution of income and advantages from real estate developments might result from reduced economic disparities within the community made possible by fair investment options.\nOne initiative in Detroit is a great illustration of how tokenization can empower communities. Here, tokenization was used by a neighborhood development organization to finance the restoration of historic homes. Token sales to locals and other investors allowed the initiative to earn enough money for repairs while guaranteeing community involvement in the design process.\nAlong with the homes’ physical enhancement, the result was a more united and proud community. The locals’ investments produced real advantages, such as improved living circumstances and employment development. This illustration demonstrates the potent potential of tokenization in using real estate investment to promote economic growth and community empowerment.\nBlocksquare is a real estate tokenization platform offering digital tokens for fractional property ownership along with technical and regulatory assistance. From token creation to distribution and exchange, this platform oversees the whole process and ensures that all transactions comply with national and international regulations. Real estate investment is simple and lawful.\nExtending this concept is the Blocksquares Regional Hub Program. It aims to build community relations and local economies through real estate investments. Through the concept, local centers are established to encourage direct community engagement in real estate prospects. Local investments are promoted, overseen, and extended with community involvement at these hubs.\nThe principal objective is to maintain the financial gains of real estate projects within the community, therefore boosting local prosperity and promoting sustainable development.\nFurthermore enhancing local involvement and fortifying community networks is this initiative. It encourages locals to make investments, boosting the local economy and strengthening their neighborhood bonds. Residents who become investors have a personal interest in the prosperity and well-being of their neighborhood, which encourages more collaboration and civic engagement among the people living there.\nBenefits from tokenized real estate investments go beyond mere financial ones. They include social and emotional benefits that raise investor happiness and the welfare of society. As their investments benefit communities, investors enjoy watching their portfolios expand.\nOne feels tremendously fulfilled when one knows that one’s investment benefits local companies, community development, or the way of life in the area. This emotional gain increases the significance of the cash outlay.\nThese investments balance the advantages to society and the financial returns. Investors who fund initiatives that prioritize sustainability, inclusiveness, and community health gain liquidity and possible asset appreciation. Under this arrangement, the quest for profit is guaranteed not to come at the price of social responsibility. Rather, it links financial success to the community’s support and advancement, fostering a robust and flourishing society.\nFuture quality of life effects from these expenditures may be substantial. More individuals participating in tokenized real estate means better infrastructure, housing quality, and local services in underprivileged regions. Better facilities and greater opportunities for locals mean raising living standards and promoting community life. Therefore, tokenized real estate investments are a potent instrument for society’s progress as they provide a complete investment strategy that respects both financial gains and the enhancement of human life.\nSince real estate tokenization opens up property investment to a larger audience, it can fundamentally alter society. The conventional obstacles, including the need for a large amount of money or contacts, are removed by this approach. Tokenization may alter how urban and rural regions grow by democratizing property investment and refocusing attention from meeting community needs to maximizing profits for a small number of people.\nPlatforms like Blocksquare are leading this shift. They encourage a cooperative society with more equally dispersed economic gains. Their ideas and technology facilitate funding and support socially beneficial projects like community centers and environmentally sustainable structures. This harmonizes economic benefits with the advancement of society.\nThe mission of Blocksquare is to inspire individuals to make real estate investments for their financial gain and the benefit of society. Those who engage in tokenized real estate may directly impact their communities and the larger social environment. Those who want their investments to represent their beliefs and promote a culture of compassion and shared wealth may find this strategy appealing.\nUsing group participation in tokenization, a future in which ownership and investment benefits are available to everybody, promoting more just and long-lasting economic growth is possible.\n","create_date":"2024-05-09T10:46:37+02:00","tag":"Real World Assets","author":""},

The integration introduces an essential tool for developers that automates compliance within their protocols, allowing them to focus on shipping high-impact projects instead of spending time developing tools to meet complex, ever-changing regulations that often differ across jurisdictions.\nInstitutions are eager to engage with DeFi protocols and technology but need to ensure that all of their trades, and trading partners, meet their compliance standards. Until now, these institutional players have been forced to either trade in manually managed pools with limited liquidity and trading volume, or to avoid DeFi altogether. With DeFi Sentinel on Sui, developers can meet institutional as well as regulator requirements via a one-time integration.\nDeFi Sentinel leverages Netki’s advanced technology to provide real-time KYC/AML, wallet screening, financial transaction monitoring, securities compliance, and tax compliance, all now integrated directly within the DeFi protocols on Sui that choose to implement the tool. The solution combines on-chain and off-chain data to ensure each transaction adheres to institutional risk, as well as regulatory standards.\nSui will also integrate Netki’s OnboardID, which, for protocols that enable it, enhances user onboarding and identity verification processes, reducing costs and simplifying compliance around the onramping process for Sui developers’ applications. Netki’s integration represents a significant advancement in making decentralized financial systems safer and more accessible globally.\n“DeFi protocols are poised to transform financial services by enhancing accessibility and transparency, but many of the best ideas fail to get off the ground due to compliance concerns,” said Evan Cheng, CEO of Mysten Labs, the original contributor to Sui. “Netki’s integration not only fortifies the security and compliance of transactions on Sui but also assures institutional and individual participants of their adherence to evolving regulatory requirements, and most importantly, gives developers the peace of mind to build with confidence.”\nNetki’s DeFi compliance oracle is unique in the industry, enabling transaction-by-transaction compliance, which is crucial for institutional adoption of DeFi tools. With features like real-time name and wallet screening, the solution ensures that compliance and risk management are seamlessly integrated into the transaction flow without compromising the user experience or developer agility.\n“By integrating DeFi Sentinel with Sui’s robust and scalable blockchain infrastructure, we are setting a new standard for safety and compliance in the DeFi space,” said Justin Newton, CEO of Netki. “We aim to enable the safe and widespread adoption of DeFi technologies, ensuring that developers can focus on innovation while evolving and expanding compliance requirements are effortlessly met.”\n\nSui Foundation [email protected]\n","create_date":"2024-05-16T15:04:15+02:00","tag":"Press Release","author":""},

The analyst sounded so bullish on ETFSwap (ETFS), predicting that it will make an unprecedented run in this market cycle. ","title":"Analyst Forecasts Unprecedented 5,000x Growth For ETFSwap (ETFS), Dogecoin (DOGE) And Shiba Inu (SHIB) Pale In Comparison - CoinCheckup","content":" A crypto analyst recently revealed their expectations for ETFSwap (ETFS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in this bull run. The analyst sounded so bullish on ETFSwap (ETFS), predicting that it will make an unprecedented run in this market cycle.\nMeanwhile, his price targets for the foremost meme coins, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), are fair enough, although they are nothing compared to his expectations for ETFSwap (ETFS).\nThe crypto analyst mentioned that ETFSwap (ETFS) will see a 5000x increase in its price in this bull run. The analyst noted that the crypto token could “easily” make this unprecedented rally, as some narratives are playing out in its favor. A run like this will likely put ETFSwap (ETFS) in a world of its own, with no other crypto asset coming close.\nThe Real World Assets (RWA) meta is one of the narratives the analyst mentioned. ETFS is the native token of ETFSwap, an RWA project that tokenizes and enables on-chain trading of on-chain trading of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The analyst claims that ETFS could gain much attention from Web3 natives once RWA becomes the leading narrative, especially with ETFSwap likely to become one of the most prominent RWA projects.\nWhen that happens, millions of dollars are expected to flow into the ETFSwap (ETFS) ecosystem, which could spark this 5000x increase in the crypto token’s price. The ETFSwap platform already did well in ensuring that its native token is the heart and soul of its ecosystem. Everyone who wants to access the variety of tokenized ETFs on the platform must hold a certain amount of ETFSwap (ETFS) tokens.\nThis move is significant given the massive adoption the crypto token could enjoy due to the hype around ETFs. This hype is already evident in the impressive demand that asset managers like BlackRock have recorded for their respective Spot Bitcoin ETFs, taking in billions of inflows in the process.\nThese funds are expected to be rotated into ETFSwap once the platform launches, seeing how accessible the platform is compared to centralized entities.\nThe crypto analyst’s expectations for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) aren’t too high, as he noted that they are both altcoins and do not have much room to run. He added that the meme coin market has also become saturated, which could hinder Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) growth in this bull run.\nConsidering this, the analyst predicts that Dogecoin (DOGE) can only rise to $1 in this market cycle. A rise to that level represents a price gain of just over 600% for the meme coin from its current price of $0.14.\nOn the other hand, the analyst predicts that Shiba Inu (SHIB) will not rise above $0.0001553 in this market cycle. A rise to that price level represents a gain of just over 500% for the second-largest meme coin by market cap from its current price of $0.00002295.\nConsidering that these price gains are nothing compared to ETFSwap’s (ETFS) unprecedented price surge, crypto investors are tilting towards the ETFSwap (ETFS) token and have chosen to go all in on the token’s ongoing presale.\nCrypto investors are flocking to the ETFSwap (ETFS) ecosystem, with over 60 million tokens sold in stage 1 of the ongoing presale. These investors say that they cannot afford to miss the massive return on investments that ETFSwap (ETFS) could potentially offer them. They also noted that the crypto is relatively cheap at its current price of $0.00854, meaning they can accumulate as much as possible.\nAt the rate these tokens are selling out, stage 1 is expected to close anytime from now, after which the token’s price will double ahead of stage 2 of the presale. That means that anyone yet to ape into these tokens must do so as soon as possible so they do not miss this life-changing opportunity.\nFor more information about the ETFS Presale:\nVisit ETFSwap Presale\nJoin The ETFSwap Community\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions presented in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinCheckup.

This article delves into the reasons behind these restrictions, user reactions, and potential solutions like using Alchemy or VPNs to bypass blockages.","title":"How to Fix MetaMask Issues in Geographically Restricted Areas - CoinCheckup","content":" MetaMask, the free browser extension and crypto wallet, has faced geofencing restrictions. MetaMask has blocked users from certain jurisdictions, including Venezuela, Russia, Iran, and more. The issue has sparked outrage in the crypto community.\nHowever, users have options to bypass these geofencing restrictions, but they may be subject to legal compliance. This article examines the issue surrounding MetaMask and the possible solutions to fixing the geofencing restrictions.\nMetamask’s geofencing restrictions in certain countries are due to legal compliance issues related to US sanctions programs. The restrictions are a result of changes made by Infura. MetaMask relies on Infura, a blockchain node infrastructure to access the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe geofencing restrictions are not a ban, but rather, blocking access to MetaMask’s platform. Although Metamask has not publicly disclosed the specific reasons that have led to these restrictions, it is clear that it is intended to prevent users from buying, selling, trading, and using a MetaMask casino using the Ethereum blockchain within these blocked regions.\nSeveral users expressed disappointment and outrage over the restrictions, which have prevented them from accessing their crypto wallets. Most users complained saying their transactions sent through MetaMask were not realized. The first to report the issue were Iranians who realized their accounts were either reportedly locked or users were deactivated.\nUsers in restricted countries face challenges related to internet censorship and geofencing restrictions, limiting their access to certain services and websites, including OpenSea and Infura. These restrictions are often due to compliance with the US and impact users’ ability to interact with the Ethereum network, transfer NFTs on OpenSea, and access other cryptocurrency services.\nDespite these challenges faced by users, MetaMask has provided its users with possible solutions:\nUsers can switch their MetaMask wallet endpoint to Alchemy. Alchemy is an Infura competitor. Alchemy has outlined specific guidelines for anyone who wants to use its servers. Here’s a quick guide on how to do so:\nIt is important to note that this may not work since Alchemy’s terms of service do not accept subscribers from countries that are not allowed to use its services. However, there are other options to try.\nUsers can try using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to spoof Infura. This might give you access to Metamask. Using a VPN might not work either, since both Infura and Alchemy are US-based companies. Users may experience limitations when using VPNs including network reliability, legal consequences, and cybersecurity concerns.\nIf using a VPN and switching to Alchemy is unsuccessful, users can try to import their wallets into another price of client software. The client software in this case refers to other Ethereum wallet applications or platforms that allow users to interact with the Ethereum network that could access crypto casinos, interact with smart contracts, or buy or sell non-fungible tokens. Client software could include self-custodial wallets like MyEtherWallet, and Trust Wallet, or hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger.\nSelf-custody refers to holding and managing your own digital assets, without having to rely on third-party custodians. In the case of Metamask’s geofencing restrictions, self-custody is crucial as it ensures that you have direct control over your funds. This allows you to access them independently, even if you are unable to use MetaMask in certain jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, self-custody improves security as users are responsible for safeguarding their private keys and seed phrases. This reduces the risks associated with hacking, mishandling of assets, and unauthorized access to your funds. Overall, self-custody allows you to be in control when external factors, like the restrictions faced by MetaMask, may limit access to centralized services.\nFinally, self-custody allows users to access decentralized applications and participate in various blockchain activities without having to rely on third-party centralized services. Instead, create a non-custodial wallet, like a hardware or paper wallet that gives you full control over your private keys. Although self-custody has its own challenges, it could prevent users from getting locked out from using their wallets.\n","create_date":"2024-05-06T09:19:26+02:00","tag":"MetaMask","author":""},

Learn about anonymity, low fees, security, and potential risks associated with cryptocurrency betting!","title":"The Evolution of Gambling in the Cryptocurrency Era - CoinCheckup","content":" Online gambling has passed through several changes and evolutions due to technological developments. Cryptocurrency, a decentralised digital currency without a central authority, has made great strides as an excellent payment option in the gaming industry in recent years, thanks to blockchain technology.\nAdding Bitcoin to gaming has made things better for players by making it more accessible, secure, and faster. Numerous platforms now provide exclusive offers such as no deposit free spins Australia specifically for users who opt for cryptocurrency as their primary method of transaction.\nThis article explores the dynamic interaction between gambling and cryptocurrencies, tracing the evolution of cryptocurrency gaming to address key questions surrounding the contemporary online betting landscape.\nGambling has always been a big part of many cultures and eras. People began gambling using bone dice with six sides centuries ago. Playing cards, poker, roulette, slot machines, and the like have contributed to the development and expansion of gaming over the years.\nIn contrast, the concept of cryptocurrencies is relatively recent. Key features of cryptocurrencies include their capacity to create new units of currency and the use of encryption to secure and validate transactions. Their decentralised nature, facilitated by blockchain technology, sets them apart from traditional funds controlled by central entities like banks.\nBitcoin, the first and most famous representative, was created as a decentralised digital money system that gets rid of intermediaries and transaction fees. Many coins have cropped up since Bitcoin’s launch, including Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ripple, and countless others.\nA web of gaming and cryptocurrency relationships has existed since Bitcoin’s infancy. Online gamblers were among the first to utilise this coin because they saw the possibilities of anonymous money to overcome the limitations of more conventional gaming sites.\nSince then, new platforms, games, and services related to Bitcoin and gambling have been developing annually, and cryptocurrencies are now accepted for gambling in several online casinos.\nCompared to regular money gambling, using crypto has perks that gamers like. One significant advantage of Bitcoin is that you can stay anonymous. When people gamble online, many want to keep their stuff private, and cryptocurrencies help. You don’t have to share your name, address, or bank details if you’re using crypto for bets. It makes the whole gaming experience more private and secure.\nProblems like censorship and identity theft are being completely avoided or reduced because of crypto assets. It does not matter if a player is physically located in another nation; they can still place bets with cryptocurrencies.\nThese days, many websites pick out the best choices for crypto gambling. Listed below are some benefits of betting with crypto assets.\nSince cryptocurrency transactions have no intermediaries or costs, it is a fantastic option to save money for gamblers. By potentially saving or even increasing their bankrolls, bettors may avoid the high costs of commissions and fees associated with traditional gambling platforms. Given the relatively low inflation and deflation rates, cryptocurrency investors stand an increased opportunity to profit from the potential price gains of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the future.\nPlaying with Bitcoin and other digital coins gives gamers a lot of freedom. The decision on which currency, payment options, and platform to gamble with is yours. Among the cutting-edge offerings to bettors are decentralised apps, games with confirmed fairness, and smart contracts.\nTo prevent hacking, tampering, and double-spending, cryptocurrency transactions rely on encryption and blockchain technology for validation and security. Users don’t have to rely on or trust intermediaries like banks or payment processors with their money or personal information.\nCryptocurrency transactions are fast and efficient because they don’t involve middlemen or fees. Confirming and processing transactions can take minutes or even seconds, depending on the network and cryptocurrency. This starkly contrasts traditional payment methods, which typically take much longer. With crypto gambling, players experience no permissions or delays when depositing or withdrawing money.\nWhile players certainly benefit from crypto gaming, casino operators also reap certain benefits. A perk of Bitcoin and similar assets is the access they provide game companies to previously unreachable regions, developing nations, and massive user bases. Not to mention that the myriad of difficulties, such as those pertaining to regulation and the law, associated with more conventional methods of payment will take a back seat.\nTo boost consumer happiness, operators may use crypto gambling to provide a safe, fair, and honest environment for players. This offers a thrilling gaming experience that will attract new players and enthusiasts. As a means to combat manipulation, fraud, and corruption, operators might utilise cryptocurrencies. Also, gambling companies are getting a leg up in innovation because of crypto betting’s usage of blockchain technology, decentralised applications, and provably fair games.\nGambling with cryptocurrencies offers various potential benefits, but has some downsides. These are:\nAs time has passed, gambling and cryptocurrencies have evolved, influencing each other in various ways. Cryptocurrencies make transactions smoother, bring in more players globally, and reduce fees in the online gaming industry.\nWith growing awareness of the benefits of Bitcoin and similar assets, along with increasing regulatory acceptance, experts anticipate that integrating crypto assets with online gambling will continue to reshape the gaming industry. This shift is expected to open up new opportunities for everyone involved in the industry.\n","create_date":"2024-03-26T15:35:00+02:00","tag":"Casino","author":""},

The market is buzzing with a plethora of options, each promising growth and stability. Investors are eagerly seeking the best picks that stand out in reliability and performance. This article unpacks the prime choices set to make a significant impact, guiding through the top selections poised for potential success in this thriving environment.\nBlastUP has been getting a lot of attention lately thanks to its high potential to become a major force in the crypto industry. This pioneering launchpad on Blast has already attracted over 15,000 active users.\nThe ongoing presale of BlastUP is a huge success, more than $6 million raised so far. The BlastUP token is considered by crypto experts as a hidden crypto gem that can skyrocket 1000% by the end of this year.\nBlastUP helps crypto startups grow faster and earn more. As BlastUP forges ahead, it remains committed to creating a global hub for the Blast community. BlastUP is rapidly gaining traction for the benefit of all participants in this ecosystem.\nBlastUP’s roadmap extends into 2026, promising the introduction of AI-driven tools and the Community Marketplace, further enriching the ecosystem’s capabilities.\nThe BlastUP token, a cornerstone of the platform, unlocks access to tiered IDO launches, staking rewards, and exclusive loyalty benefits.\nMantle sees a tough time with prices wavering just below a dollar, hinting at uncertainty among investors. It’s encountered recent resistance, unable to cross higher price marks, while also staying just above a lower boundary that prevents it from dropping further. Recent weeks have shown a decrease, yet looking back over several months, Mantle’s value has surged quite impressively. The current mood suggests caution, but past growth may bring hope. Given Mantle’s technology and prospects, the mixed market signals might influence short-term traders and long-term investors differently.\nGnosis has been experiencing a tough market climate recently. Looking at its recent price movements, it seems to be under some pressure, swinging between higher lows and lower highs. Despite any positive momentum in the past half-year, short-term sentiment appears bearish, with the cryptocurrency struggling to hold its value. For Gnosis, which focuses on new market mechanisms for decentralized finance, the current sentiments could influence its innovative projects. Investors watch closely for signs of recovery or further decline in this uncertain phase.\nThe 1inch Network token currently exhibits varied market signals, showing a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. A comparison of recent and past prices shows inadequate momentum in either direction, hinting at uncertainty among traders. However, the token is not far below commonly watched averages, suggesting a balance of recent performance with historical trends. The market’s decision indicators are nearly balanced, pointing to cautious but not overly bearish sentiment. As for 1inch itself, being a gateway to multiple liquidity sources, its potential to draw users seeking the best trade prices could play a pivotal role in its demand and subsequent price movements.\nChia’s market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic as recent trends show a balance of gains and stability. Despite minor weekly setbacks, its medium-term growth remains substantial, showcasing resilience. This progress could be underpinned by Chia’s innovative approach to cryptocurrency, involving a unique “farming” process rather than “mining,” which promises a more energy-efficient and sustainable operation. Given the growing concern for eco-friendly blockchain solutions, Chia’s steady performance and sustainable features may attract investors seeking a greener crypto future.\nFor investors looking towards 2024, coins like MNT, GNO, and 1INCH may not offer immediate high returns, but they are solid picks for a diverse portfolio. XCH also brings interest to the table but might not stand out in the short term. The standout project with the highest potential is BlastUP.

Comparing the Titans - CoinCheckup","content":" XRP is undoubtedly one of the leading tokens in the crypto market today. Many experts argue that the key to XRP’s success is its active cooperation with investment companies and international banks.\nOn the other hand, RCO Finance (RCOF) is a relatively newer decentralized trading platform with its token that allows investors to trade crypto and stocks without using fiat currency.\nNow, on to the big question: Can this new crypto token outpace XRP in global crypto influence?\nXRP was created as an alternative to money transfers in bank systems, and it quickly rose to popularity, especially in financial institutions.\nToday, XRP is available on several popular crypto exchanges for traders and investors. At the time of writing, the trading volume is currently valued at $917.05M.\nDespite XRP being one of the most popular coins today, its future value and profitability are still being determined. Expert analysts forecast that XRP will range between $0.56 and $0.83 throughout 2024. The price of XRP today is $0.5053, which aligns with the forecast.\nThis fluctuation further highlights the volatile nature of the XRP token and how difficult it is to predict an uptrend with this particular cryptocurrency.\nLike the XRP Ledger, RCO Finance has its native token, RCOF, which will potentially redefine the entire DeFi space.\nWith crypto, sometimes it’s even more profitable to invest in newer blockchain technologies, as they offer opportunities to make massive profits and become one of the pioneering forces in the new network.\nFor example, RCO Finance’s DeFi trading platform uses a governance model that allows its users to contribute to the project’s success. So, if you buy presale tokens, you gain the right to participate in the project’s development through its forums and voting mechanisms.\nThe platform aims to revolutionize the crypto scene by offering investors multiple DeFi products, including Automated Market Making, liquidity pools, and yield farming.\nOnce you sign up on the platform, you have full control over your account and can buy US stocks with crypto without needing any intermediaries.\nThat’s not all. With the AI stock trading platform RCO finance offers, investors don’t have to monitor trades 24/7 to make informed trading decisions.\nThe AI tool adjusts investment portfolios in real-time and maximizes investment returns by quickly responding to changing market conditions.\nMaking money while sleeping is possible with RCO finance. For this reason, even crypto newbies will find it helpful and may consider investing in the platform.\nAll these features will make RCOF one of the coins that will make you the most profit by the end of 2024.\nXRP has been in the crypto game for a while, with no particular uptrend surges in recent years. Its all-time high was $3.84 in 2018. So, RCO Finance may outpace it sooner than you can imagine.\nDespite being new in the crypto landscape, RCOF positions itself as the latest mouth-watering opportunity for investors. The current value of its presale tokens is at only $0.0127. Early investors also stand to enjoy 40% off their trading fees and win exclusive bonuses.\nFor more information about the RCO Finance Presale:\nVisit RCO Finance Presale\nJoin The RCO Finance Community\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions presented in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinCheckup.

{"url":"https://coincheckup.com/blog/sui-turns-one-debut-year-of-growth-and-tech-breakthroughs-puts-sui-at-forefront-of-web3/","web_url":"https://coincheckup.com/blog/","type":"article","description":"Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, May 3rd, 2024, Chainwire","title":"Sui Turns One: Debut Year of Growth and Tech Breakthroughs Puts Sui at Forefront of Web3 - CoinCheckup","content":" \nGrand Cayman, Cayman Islands, May 3rd, 2024, Chainwire\n\nOn the first anniversary of Sui’s Mainnet launch, the Sui community is celebrating a landmark year that saw it rise from a nascent ecosystem to the top tier of Layer 1 blockchains, amassing household name partners and shipping multiple technology breakthroughs in the process. In the build-up to its launch in 2023, the chatter around Sui reached a level of excitement that has not been matched by any chain that has launched since. The first anniversary of Sui represents a culmination of the remarkable milestones achieved by the network in its first year.\nWhile centralized institutions face growing public distrust due to decades of anti-competitive and anti-consumer behavior and legacy blockchains lack the speed and technology to solve the problem, in a single year, Sui has emerged as the decentralized solution most capable of disrupting the status quo at scale. The innovations of Sui begin with Sui’s novel programming language, Move, which was created by Mysten Labs Co-founder and CTO Sam Blackshear. Move introduced a new architecture centered around objects, enabling performance and functionality that was simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry — the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets.\n“Like many transformative innovations before us, we knew the problem we had to solve and built the technology to solve it without applying labels, but a year after launch, it is clear that Sui is a vibrant developer ecosystem,” said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs. “Developers are taking advantage of Sui’s performance, and its scalable, composable, on-chain storage, and native accessibility features to build sustainable business models with a consumer ownership-first approach. While the Network’s achievements to date are remarkable, the road to onboarding the next billion users to web3 has just started.”\nTechnology Innovations\nThe results Sui has achieved have validated the team’s approach. In addition to not experiencing a single minute of downtime or instance of degraded performance since Mainnet launch, in the last 12 months, Sui has achieved:\nYet technology improvements are a constant at Sui. In recent weeks, including at its first global in-person conference, Sui Basecamp, Sui unveiled Mysticeti, which significantly shortens Sui’s end-to-end time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by enabling individual validators to use multiple machines to extend their capacity.\nSui has also introduced unique implementations of technologies that make adoption easier and make the blockchain accessible to mainstream users, both at the enterprise and retail levels. zkLogin is on-chain authorization with traditional OAuth providers like Google and Twitter, allowing all users to directly operate on-chain with the single sign-on process they have become accustomed to, removing the hurdle of managing wallet addresses and seed phrases. zkSend is an application exclusive to Sui that utilizes zkLogin to enable users to send and claim tokens simply by sharing or clicking a link. Sponsored transactions, enabled by Sui’s extremely low fees, empower builders to remove a final hurdle for engagement. Finally, Enoki, which was announced at Sui Basecamp, removes requirements for enterprises looking to incorporate blockchain technology with a turnkey solution that gives them access to build seamlessly on Sui.\n“The rate at which the ecosystem’s deep and talented developer community has shipped powerful protocols and industry-first technology breakthroughs has been breathtaking, and it’s only a year in,” said Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-founder and CPO at Mysten Labs. “Sui’s purpose is to redefine how individuals and businesses collaborate to create, grow, and share value in a digital-first economy and since its mainnet launch, Sui has demonstrated important and unique capabilities in that regard.”\nNetwork Momentum – Sui is a destination for DeFi, Gaming and Commerce\nAlso owing to the strength of the network and especially notable for an ecosystem so early in its development, Sui has quickly become one of the preeminent destinations for DeFi activity. Within 9 months of its Mainnet launch, Sui ranked in the Top 10 of all blockchains in TVL. A month later, Sui’s DEX volume also achieved top 10 status. Throughout, Wormhole stats show Sui as a top destination for bridging from Ethereum, including over a 30-day period where Sui saw more inflows than all other blockchains combined, and more than twice as much as the next closest blockchain. In each of these cases, Sui eclipsed numerous well-known networks that have existed for far longer.\nBuilders and enterprises integrating with Sui are also adding to the growing momentum. Bluefin, a derivatives exchange that had already executed billions in transaction volume in its first iteration on another chain, shut that integration down to build on Sui. Solend, a leading lending protocol on Solana, chose Sui for its first integration beyond its initial network, launching the Suilend protocol which has already amassed over $30M TVL. Additionally, First Digital Labs, creator of FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto with over $4B in market cap, chose Sui for its first expansion since its launch on Ethereum and BNB.\n“As we mark the first anniversary of Sui’s launch, the growth and innovation within the Sui ecosystem have been sensational and Sui has quickly ascended to the forefront of Layer 1 blockchains,” said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. “Sui’s global footprint has continued to expand at a remarkable rate as more and more builders see Sui as the best platform for enabling real world solutions aimed at addressing the world’s most pressing challenges.”\nGaming is another focus for Sui that will continue in the coming months and years. With low, predictable fees that allow game developers to build with confidence and dynamic objects that make games built on Sui more expressive, Sui is the optimal blockchain for gaming studios. Dozens of development teams are currently building games on Sui, including established studios such as NHN (Pebble City), ONBUFF x SNK (Samurai Shodown), NDUS Interactive (Xociety), Orange Comet (The Walking Dead: Lands), and Ambrus Studio (E4C: Final Salvation). Leading professional esports team, Team Liquid, will leverage Sui for the relaunch of its fan loyalty program, and at Sui Basecamp in April, Sui joined gaming infrastructure developer Playtron in announcing SuiPlay0X1, the first handheld gaming device with native blockchain capabilities to wide acclaim.\nOther notable ecosystem partnerships achieved in Sui’s first year include those with Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud, which focused on enhancing security, scalability, developer tools and user experiences across a range of Web 3.0 and AI-powered applications. BytePlus, the web3 arm of ByteDance, partnered with Sui ecosystem partner Mysten Labs to explore collaboration on data warehousing, AI recommendation algorithms, and AI visual algorithms in web3 game platforms and socialFi projects on Sui.\nThe crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui’s arrival, as over 1,000 projects, partners, investors and enthusiasts from 65 countries around the world came to Paris in April to celebrate Sui at the vaunted Layer 1’s inaugural global conference.\n\nSui Foundation [email protected]\n","create_date":"2024-05-03T21:12:12+02:00","tag":"Press Release","author":""},

However, unlike most meme coins, Kittynomia (KIN) stands out due to the creation of its universe that users can interact with, connect with, and earn.\nHowever, with blockchain technology, developers have the opportunity to create public or private access for users with individual governance depending on the model. Blockchain provides its users with so many options that centralized systems cannot.\nFurthermore, it is also important to note that blockchain has its downside. Therefore the need for coins like Binance to help provide effective solutions through its innovative ecosystem.\nBinance is a cryptocurrency exchange based on day-to-day trading volume. Tokenized by BNB, the Binance network includes – Binance Academy, Binance Chain, Binance Smart Chain, Trust Wallet, and Research projects. However, all these networks employ blockchain technology to deliver new-age finance.\nBinance is a cryptocurrency exchange platform that is based on daily trading volume. Launched in 2017, the Binance platform is tokenized by BNB. However, this blockchain has grown significantly over the years, but specific blockchain-based issues still occur with the Binance platform. Furthermore, this blockchain platform strives for development.\nAlthough Binance mainly functions as a trading platform, it still has shortcomings that cannot be overlooked. Binance is recognized as the biggest cryptocurrency exchange. The Binance platform carries out exchange transactions globally based on a trading volume.\nTokenized by BNB, this trading platform aims to bring cryptocurrency globally to the forefront of financial activity. However, the idea behind the Binance name shows a new paradigm in global finance: Binary finance.\nThe Binance platform, asides from being the most powerful exchange platform in the cryptocurrency market, BNB has launched an ecosystem that caters to the functionality of its platform for its users. Also, the Binance platform was officially launched in 2017 by Zhao Changpeng. However, the Binance platform has other Binance networks functioning in its ecosystem in a bid to bring new-age finance to the world.\nHowever, the Binance platform does not come without its shortcomings—however, most of the problems that these blockchain encounters are usually regulatory. Furthermore, the federal reserves tightening their monetary policies have affected the Binance coin.\nHowever, the tightening of monetary policies led to a rise in inflation, making the government want to pull back on the economic boosters. As a result, investors are beginning to pull out of risky assets.\nKittynomica, however, is not just a meme coin but also a sustainable project that has remodeled the entire outlook of crypto. The Kittynomica platform has shown this through its removal of its development team’s incentive to ensure equality all through the Kittynomica platform. Also, the native token of Kittynomica is KIN, a BEP-20 token that runs 0n the Binance Smart Chain network.\nAs a result, the full ownership of assets that exist for wallet holders pushes and encourages collaboration of the crypto enthusiasts’ investment in the Kittynomica platform to accomplish the platform’s goals.\nAlso, the Kittynomica platform focuses on the metaverse ecosystem to ensure its users get full access to the crypto metaverse. Furthermore, the easy access to NFTs and the metaverse sides of cryptocurrency that Kittynomica provides make this platform the best.\nThere is assured security in the Kittynomica platform. Built on blockchain technology, the Kittynomica platform is well secured, and users’ and investors’ assets are very much connected. However, with its blockchain technology, the possibility of fraud is minimal.\nFurthermore, decentralization is also a feat that Kittynomica, as a meme coin, is incredibly proud of. The decentralization of Kittynoma facilitates peer-to-peer trading. Also, creators’ ingenuity is sufficiently unleashed, enabling them to create valuable memes.\nKittynomica is a very innovative meme coin that effectively caters to its users and investors while sufficiently helping them build reputable portfolios that is very much diverse.\n","create_date":"2022-09-07T13:25:03+02:00","tag":"Binance Coin","author":""},

With this rise in popularity, the need for a safe and secure way to store cryptocurrencies has also increased.\nThis is where metal crypto wallets come in. Made from materials such as stainless steel and titanium, these wallets provide a high level of security, protecting your digital assets from hackers and other forms of online theft. With so many options available, it can be difficult to know which metal crypto wallet is the best for your needs.\nIn this article, we will take a closer look at the 10 best metal crypto wallets on the market, comparing their features, security, and ease of use. So whether you’re a seasoned cryptocurrency investor or just getting started, read on to discover the best metal crypto wallet for you.\nHere are our picks for the 10 best seed phrase storage options in 2024:\nThis article aims to explore the best and most recommended products for storing crypto seeds available on the market in 2024. Analyzing their benefits and drawbacks will equip you with the necessary information to make an educated choice on how to safeguard your seed phrase best.\nThe Cryptotag Zeus is a state-of-the-art titanium wallet seed phrase backup system created by Cryptotag to ensure the ultimate safety of your recovery seed. The Zeus is a 6mm thick bulletproof, waterproof, and shockproof titanium plate that can endure the most extreme conditions. The fact that this metal wallet received the highest score on the Jameson Lopp durability test proves its outstanding resistance to external factors, such as extreme temperature (up to 1667°C), high pressure, corrosion, and even extreme physical damage, such as being beaten with a pneumatic hammer. It also allows you to store up to 24 BIP39-compatible recovery seed words.\nThe only disadvantage is the rather long process of inputting the seed phrase. You have to look up the seed phrase words in the BIP39 recovery seed word list, find their respective number, and punch them in using the included center punch. For sure, this process is a bit more time-consuming compared to other metal wallets, but you will only have to punch in the seed phrase once. Once the words are engraved in the wallet’s titanium slate, the pros heavily outweigh the cons, which makes Cryptotag Zeus a must-have wallet for long-time HODLers who value the security and durability of their investment.\nPros of Cryptotag Zeus:\nCons of Cryptotag Zeus:\nThe Billfodl is undoubtedly one of the most reliable seed phrase backup options available on the market in 2024. It is essentially a sleek and compact steel case built to withstand fire, water, and other destructive factors. According to its spec sheet, the Billfodl’s marine-grade stainless steel can endure temperatures that are more than twice the average house fire temperature, withstand shocks of up to 1 million volts, and is fully rust-resistant. In addition, setting up the device is straightforward.\nYou can simply insert the first four letters of each of the 24 mnemonic seed phrase words into the metal case and seal it by screwing in the top screw. This device was engineered by the trusted experts at Ledger and is priced at roughly $105. When stored in a safe place and used in combination with a quality crypto hardware wallet, such as the Ledger Nano X, the Billfodl provides the highest level of security and protection for your digital assets.\nPros of The Billfodl:\nCons of The Billfodl:\nCryptosteel Capsule is another high-quality solution for seed phrase storage. The Capsule, which is made of 303- and 304-grade stainless steel, provides high protection to external conditions, such as resisting temperatures up to 1400°C and withstanding pressure up to 150,000 N. Nevertheless, what sets this wallet apart from its competitors is its unique shape and concept of storing the seed phrase. Rather than aligned on a plate, the characters of the recovery phrase are stringed on a central rod. The words are separated by the separator tiles included in the package.\nTogether with the capacity to store 123 instead of 96 characters most other solutions provide, this allows users to store 12 unabbreviated seed phrase words. Setting up the Cryptosteel Capsule is super easy – you simply slide the letters on the rod in the same order as they appear in the recovery phrase. Recovering the seed phrase is a bit more difficult though, but hopefully, you will never need to go through that. A single Cryptosteel Capsule costs $105.\nPros of Cryptosteel Capsule:\nCons of Cryptosteel Capsule:\nThe Trezor Legacy Bundle is a top-notch crypto wallet and seed phrase storage kit that includes a Cryptotag Zeus seed storage device and a Trezor Model T crypto wallet. The combination provides arguably unrivaled security against hacks, thefts, and natural disasters. Despite its price tag of over $280, it’s still a more affordable option than buying a separate Model T ($179) and Cryptotag Zeus ($139).\nThe Cryptotag Zeus is made of stainless steel and is shockproof, waterproof, and fire-resistant, while the Trezor Model T is a multi-purpose hardware wallet that functions as an authenticator and digital ID.\nPros of Shamir HODL Pack:\nCons of Shamir HODL Pack:\nThe Cryptosteel Cassette is a simple yet reliable and robust metal wallet. As its name suggests, the wallet is made of 304-grade stainless steel that can withstand water, rust, shocks, and fire up to 1200°C. Since the seed phrase is stored in a physical form, your wallet will also be much less prone to hacker attacks if you keep the cassette in a safe place.\nThe package includes the metal cassette and 800 letter tiles, which should be more than enough to constitute your 12-word seed phrase. Cryptosteel Cassette is launched in partnership with Trezor, a leading cryptocurrency hardware wallet producer and the main competitor to Ledger. The metal wallet comes with a relatively high price tag of $94 but this also includes a lifetime satisfaction guarantee. In addition, if you order 2 Cassetters, the second one is discounted by 50%.\nPros of Cryptosteel Cassette:\nCons of Cryptosteel Cassette:\nSafePal Cypher Seed Board is a user-friendly mnemonic wallet. Like many other wallets, it is made of 304-grade stainless steel, a robust material that ensures longevity and protection against moisture and scratches. However, the manufacturer of the Cypher Seed Board does not guarantee it will withstand such extreme conditions as its more expensive counterparts and only includes a one-year warranty.\nNevertheless, this metal wallet has many other advantages, such as being lightweight, easily portable, and highly customizable. Users can choose from various fonts and design options to fill in the word slots. SafePal Cypher Seed Board supports the storage of 12, 18, and 24-word seed phrases and sells for a reasonable price of $45.\nPros of SafePal Cypher Seed Board:\nCons of SafePal Cypher Seed Board:\nSteelwallet is an offline metal storage solution that ensures the safety of your seed phrase from electric shock, fire, water, and corrosion. Its two engraved stainless-steel sheets can store up to 12 recovery words on each page, totalling up to 24 words.\nThe wallet is highly durable, resistant to radiation and mechanical force, and compatible with the BIP-39-word list. You can punch the boxes of the letters to store your seed phrase with the puncher that comes included in the package. This low-tech metal wallet is made in Switzerland and costs $65.\nPros of Steelwallet:\nCons of Steelwallet:\nEllipal Mnemonic Metal is a unique and innovative solution for storing your seed phrases securely. It is made of lightweight aluminum and measures a compact 86mm x 60mm x 8mm, which makes it an excellent portable option. It takes on a clamshell form and is designed to hold 12 or 24-word recovery phrases compatible with the BIP39 recovery phrase format. It comes with a set of letter stamps that are inserted in the slots and a screwdriver that is needed to screw on the front panel and thereby lock the letters in place. The wallet can also be locked with a padlock for an additional layer of security.\nWhile the wallet is highly durable, it is all but indestructible. It may be subject to damage if excessive force is used. In addition, its temperature resistance is not very high due to its aluminum-based construction (aluminum’s melting point is at around 660°C). The Ellipal Mnemonic Metal wallet is still a good deal, especially after counting in its affordable price of only $59.\nPros of Ellipal Mnemonic Metal:\nCons of Ellipal Mnemonic Metal:\nThe imKey Safe Kit is a comprehensive security kit that combines a stainless-steel metal seed phrase storage product with a hardware wallet.

As a third layer and component of a tiered blockchain stack, Orbs is configured as a separate decentralized infrastructure layer that operates between current L1/L2 solutions and the application layer.\nOrbs Network extends the underlying Layer1 blockchain and operates as Layer 3 on the underlying block it builds on. The main foundation of Orbs has always been the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). Orbs Network works with Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche and Fantom networks in addition to the Ethereum mainnet and it offers smart contract developers all its features on these platforms.\nIn the past few years, the blockchain sector has advanced significantly, achieving excellent results in terms of decentralization, traction, and capitalization. Uniswap and Pancakeswap are two protocols that have achieved billions of dollars in TVL. Although these successes make us happy, we think that great transitions have not yet come.\nOrbs has always kept active the dream of making blockchain technology accessible to billions of end users and has always prioritized its commitment to EVM, its production on Ethereum and other networks and also had been awaiting an L1 that could carry this dream with patience.\nWith the daily integration of blockchain technology into our lives, two fresh competitors with large user bases have emerged. Facebook announced The Libra project, which promised to bring mass adoption of stablecoins. Telegram revealed the Telegram Open Network and its token GRAM that were meant to involve its sizeable user base in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, both initiatives had to come to a stop since they were eventually unable to establish an appropriate regulatory way forward.\nThe open source community later adopted the abandoned TON codebase, forked it, and resurrected it as The Open Network (TON), which now has a completely decentralized new token called TON Coin. Early in 2021, TON’s mainnet was formally launched and has since grown in popularity. Today, the network has more than a million active wallets, and the CEO of Telegram has even publicly praised it.\nA careful examination reveals that TON is the first Layer 1 with the infrastructure to move the blockchain ecosystem to mass adoption. Bitcoin, the first of all blockchains, took the throne as the first L1 cryptocurrency, and Ethereum performed poorly in this competition. However, when we look at TON, we can see that it doesn’t compete with Ethereum and instead concentrates on acquiring a fresh, uncompromised Layer 1 use case. It is clear that he is close to achieving this goal, and it is anticipated that he will finally ascend to the throne.\nOrbs has now announced that TON will be the first non-EVM layer 1 that they will be building on. The TON ecosystem is still in its infancy and is not yet as developed as the EVM environment, but it has enormous promise. Orbs will be happy to assist in bringing it into maturity and achieving its potential.\nAs a L3 infrastructure layer, Orbs is establishing itself as a significant player in the TON ecosystem and creating brand new L3 use-cases for TON-based protocols. Orbs’ innovations have a lot of place in the developing TON ecosystem, and there is a ton of opportunity to seize thrilling chances and be early adopters. TON gains traction and Orbs can construct some of the essential infrastructure there and launch themselves toward the moon.\nIt is better to follow ORBS for a clear understanding about the various use-cases, goods, and services that the Orbs network will be releasing on TON.\n","create_date":"2022-09-07T14:55:16+02:00","tag":"Cryptocurrency","author":""},

With 706 active validator nodes, the Nakamoto Coefficient for the Humanode is 236, shooting past the prior number one, Mina, which has a Nakamoto Coefficient of 155. Polkadot now holds the 3rd place.\nThe Nakamoto Coefficient is a measure that represents how many node operators will be required to control the share of a layer-1 blockchain which is enough to shut down the network if validators coordinate to do so. The greater the number, the more decentralized the blockchain is.\n\n“Proof-of-Stake blockchains tend to centralize around the biggest validators or staking protocols, like Lido, which actually hold the infrastructure. If Lido goes down once, people will start questioning the decentralization of Proof-of-Stake networks. They may have millions of nodes, but the real control over consensus is in the hands of few. We always wanted to change this,” says Humanode co-founder Victor. “In Humanode, one person can only launch one node, which is verified with cryptobiometric technology. All validators wield equal power, meaning that the Humanode chain decentralization increases proportionally to the number of human nodes. Imagine what kind of Nakamoto Coefficient will be achieved when we hit 10,000 nodes or 1 million nodes!? This makes a coordinated attack almost impossible. No project will be able to claim that it is more decentralized than Humanode.”\nHumanode will soon unveil its governance protocol where one human node has only one vote, creating the first democratic DAO which will control the further development of the core protocol and its ecosystem.\nAbout Humanode\nHumanode, built on Polkadot SDK as an EVM Compatible Layer-1, is the first cryptobiometric blockchain where one human = one node = one vote. It utilizes private facial recognition which protects against multiple accounts and bots taking advantage of retroactive airdrops, DAOs, DeFi, NFT mints, GameFi, and more. After just a year from mainnet launch, Humanode boasts 500,000+ users and 70+ projects utilizing its cryptobiometric technology.\n\nShannon Higgins [email protected]\n","create_date":"2024-05-02T14:35:37+02:00","tag":"Press Release","author":""},

With investor interest piqued, understanding which coins could lead the charge offers valuable insight into where the market might be heading. Continue reading to uncover these promising cryptocurrencies and what makes them stand out in the bustling crypto space.\nBlastUP has been getting a lot of attention lately thanks to its high potential to become a major force in the crypto industry. This pioneering launchpad on Blast has already attracted over 15,000 active users.\nThe ongoing presale of BlastUP is a huge success, more than $6 million raised so far. The BlastUP token is considered by crypto experts as a hidden crypto gem that can skyrocket 1000% by the end of this year.\nBlastUP helps crypto startups grow faster and earn more. As BlastUP forges ahead, it remains committed to creating a global hub for the Blast community. BlastUP is rapidly gaining traction for the benefit of all participants in this ecosystem.\nBlastUP’s roadmap extends into 2026, promising the introduction of AI-driven tools and the Community Marketplace, further enriching the ecosystem’s capabilities.\nThe BlastUP token, a cornerstone of the platform, unlocks access to tiered IDO launches, staking rewards, and exclusive loyalty benefits.\nAfter experiencing a significant surge in value, Jupiter’s price appears to be consolidating. Investors are watching closely as it trades within a narrow band under the first ceiling that it’s struggling to break, yet comfortably above a price floor that’s preventing further drops.

How Jupiter fares in coming trading sessions could provide insight into its ability to maintain the remarkable trajectory it’s charted over recent months.\nIn recent times, Toncoin has experienced significant growth that points to a bullish market sentiment. The coin is currently trading in a range above its strong support level, suggesting a solid base for potential upward movements. It has surpassed its short-term average price, highlighting positive momentum. For a coin that’s designed to support ultra-fast transactions and smart contracts, this uptick could suggest increasing trust and interest from investors looking for high-performance blockchain platforms, potentially driving further adoption and price increases.\nIn conclusion, JUP and TON might see less growth in the short-term. However, BlastUP stands out with significant potential for growth. The strength of BlastUP comes from its strong concept and integration within the Blast ecosystem, setting it up for promising developments during the bull run of 2024.\nSite: https://blastup.io/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_io\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVW\nTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions presented in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinCheckup.

This development signals a vibrant and potentially rich sector. The achievement of BlockDAG in its presale not only sets the industry ablaze but also emphasizes the varying prospects of these three cryptocurrencies, guiding investors toward making informed choices.\nEthereum has shown impressive endurance, notably maintaining its value over the $3,250 level, indicating a solid market stance. Despite facing hurdles, Ethereum has climbed past critical resistance levels like $3,400, underscoring its durability.\nIt’s important to remember that Ethereum’s approach to its record high is more indicative of its solid foundation rather than a direct predictor of future success. Ethereum’s peak price is evidence of its historical capacity to reach significant valuations. However, investors are advised to tread carefully, recognizing that previous highs are not automatic indicators of future results.\nFantom has quickly become a focal point in the market, especially after a notable investment from Hyper Chain Capital, leading to optimistic forecasts for its price. Thanks to its cutting-edge Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism, Fantom is touted as a strong contender against Ethereum.\nThis technological advantage fuels positive expectations for Fantom’s price, suggesting potential for significant advancement and influence in the market. Nevertheless, given the crypto market’s inherent instability, these forecasts should be cautiously approached. While Fantom’s innovations are promising, investors must remain mindful of overall market movements when considering its forecasts.\nBlockDAG has made a splash as the top crypto investment for 2024, captivating investors with its presale achievements. The fourth batch of sales, priced at $0.0025 per BDAG coin, is quickly getting snapped up by investors, indicating a projected price surge for the next batch. This excitement reflects BlockDAG’s ambitious vision for transforming blockchain technology. With nearly $9 million raised in its presale and a 50% price increase anticipated for batch 5, the strong investor confidence in BlockDAG’s promise is evident.\nFor those who joined early, the investment payoff is significant. A $5,000 investment in the initial batch could potentially increase to $15,000 by the fifth batch. This presale offers substantial growth opportunities, coupled with a low barrier to entry, making it accessible for individuals to dive into the cryptocurrency realm. BlockDAG emphasizes educational and skill-building opportunities within the industry, while its approach to risk management ensures a stable and secure investment landscape, appealing to both experienced investors and novices keen on exploring the digital currency space.\nBlockDAG emerges as the leading cryptocurrency investment, outshining the looming Ethereum record high and the positive forecast for Fantom. Its groundbreaking presale approach has captured the market’s imagination, firmly establishing it, reaching almost $9 million in presale achievements. As traditional milestones like Ethereum’s peak and speculative forecasts for Fantom set the stage, BlockDAG leads toward an innovative blockchain future, offering a compelling option for those looking to invest in cryptocurrency.\nBuy BlockDAG Now\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

We looked at relevant market data and examined potential catalysts behind SHIB’s long-term growth.","title":"Shiba Inu Price Prediction 2040 & 2050: What to Expect? - CoinCheckup","content":" According to several different price projection models, the price of Shiba Inu is most likely to increase substantially by 2040 and 2050. If the meme coin follows Bitcoin’s price trajectory established over the past 5 years, SHIB could gain as much as +10,984% by 2050 and reach a price point of $0.003545.\nShiba Inu is one of the most exciting cryptocurrency projects in the crypto market today, controlling a market cap of nearly $5 billion. Following its launch in 2020, the meme token went on a massive rally that saw SHIB gain a whopping 574,432% (compared to the US dollar). With such explosive growth in its rearview mirror and low price per unit, many investors are wondering how the token could perform in the long term.\nIn this article, we are going to outline different price scenarios for Shiba Inu and examine potential growth factors.\nThe price of Shiba Inu could increase by +1,036% and reach $0.000365, according to a crypto tracking site CoinCodex. The price prediction for Shiba Inu is based on technical analysis data and historical market trends. CoinCodex’s algorithmic SHIB price prediction for 2040 forecasts that Shiba Inu would continue to grow gradually over the coming years, which could coincide with the project’s increased token burn rate (more on that later).\nIt is worth noting that Shiba Inu could easily outperform CoinCodex’s prediction. For example, Bitcoin has been growing at a 19% average annual rate over the past five years—if SHIB were to follow that same price trajectory, the meme token could gain +1,838% and exchange hands at $0.000620 in 2040, making it an exceptional long-term crypto investment.\nOver the next three decades, Shiba Inu’s price could reach as high as $0.000652, according to CoinCodex’s Shiba Inu coin price prediction for 2050. If that scenario materializes, SHIB would be trading a whopping 19 times above its current price level.\nIf you think that the above SHIB token price prediction is somewhat optimistic, you’ll probably be interested in a more conservative model based on the S&P 500’s historical growth rate over the past 50 years instead. If SHIB were to follow in the footsteps of the leading stock market index and gain 11.13% on average each year, the popular meme token’s price would grow to $0.000553, gaining +1,627% in the process.\nOn the other hand, if Shiba Inu would grow like Bitcoin in the past, we could see SHIB gaining +10,984% by 2050, reaching a price point of $0.0035. While that price growth would certainly be impressive, it is worth noting that it’s nowhere near the expectations of some investors who believe Shiba Inu coin will reach $1,000 in the future.\nOne of the most important potential price catalysts for Shiba Inu is the recently launched SHIB token burn process, which rolled out as a part of the Shibarium platform during the summer of 2023. Shibarium is a layer 2 solution for Shiba Inu that makes transactions faster and cheaper.\nShibarium burns SHIB as a part of each transaction made. Many analysts believe that this will drastically reduce the high token supply of Shiba Inu (589 trillion as of March 2024) over time and introduce deflationary pressure on the token’s price. The extent to which this could impact the value of SHIB remains to be seen, as it is impossible to predict how many SHIB will be burned once the Shibarum mainnet becomes more widely used. Some investors believe that Shiba Inu could become the next crypto to explode and reach the 1 cent or even $1 milestone thanks to Shibarium burns.\nWhile it’s impossible to predict Shiba Inu’s future price movements with certainty, it is safe to assume that the value of Shiba Inu will continue to grow, especially if crypto continues to gain traction among the mainstream crowd and the launch of Shibarium turns out to be a success.\nFor more on SHIB’s future price movements, check our analysis on whether Shiba Inu can reach 1 cent in the future. If you are interested in shorter time frames instead, we suggest you follow our Shiba Inu price prediction that showcases potential price movements for a 5-day to a 1-year time period.\n","create_date":"2024-03-28T18:57:30+02:00","tag":"Shiba Inu","author":""},

Today it is one of the societies that is more socially accepting when it comes to sports betting or gambling in online casinos, with a high participation rate of Aussie players compared to other countries.\nGiven that Australia is one of the top adopters of blockchain technology, it is not surprising that crypto-casinos have gained a great deal of popularity among Australian players.\nCrypto casinos are online gambling platforms that exclusively or primarily use cryptocurrencies for trading. These platforms allow players to deposit, wager, and withdraw funds using various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and others.\nThe online casino industry has caught on to the rising trend of digital currencies among Australian players, and not surprisingly, considering the many advantages that digital currencies offer to both players and operators.\nUsing a crypto-wallet is much more convenient than traditional methods for players who enjoy a gamble. Why?\nLike users, online casinos benefit from Blockchain technology with:\nThese advantages have led more and more of Australia’s best payout casinos to convert to crypto-casinos in order to keep up with user demands and stay ahead of their competitors.\nBlockchain technology has significantly strengthened security and privacy measures in online casinos. This is how:\nAlthough the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has provided guidance on the taxation of digital assets, the specific rules relating to crypto-gambling remain somewhat ambiguous.\nUnlike winnings from traditional casinos, the taxation of crypto winnings is subject to interpretation, leading to uncertainty among players and operators alike.\nMoreover, as rules vary across jurisdictions around the world, navigating the legal framework for crypto betting can be complex.\nHowever, Australia remains attentive to international trends and developments, aiming to align its regulations with those of other jurisdictions. As the world wrestles with the implications of cryptocurrency trading and gambling, Australia continues to refine its laws to ensure the integrity of financial transactions while balancing the interests of players and online gaming platforms within its borders.\nUnderstanding user preferences and the online casino industry-trends is crucial for assessing the future of crypto adoption in online gaming. The tech-savvy nature of many Australian online gamblers makes them receptive to crypto’s advantages. And as younger generations familiar with cryptocurrencies reach legal gambling age, the demand for crypto integration is likely to grow further.\n","create_date":"2024-05-13T10:30:00+02:00","tag":"Crypto Casinos","author":""},

There are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the market now that sell for millions of dollars, and many people mint their NFTs regularly.\nAlong with the growing notoriety of NFTs, the use of cryptocurrencies is also seeing an uptick in adoption rates. The primary reason for this is that cryptocurrencies facilitate the buying and selling of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nToday, Decentraland (MANA) and Collectixt Token (CLEX) are the top two most popular cryptocurrencies for NFT transactions. Continue reading to find out more about these cryptocurrencies and their remarkable benefits.\nDecentraland (MANA) is a cryptocurrency that was recently introduced and has the potential to generate significant earnings. On Decentraland, users have access to various unique interfaces that they can use to create and sell digital content. People can buy and sell virtual goods in the metaverse with this network. MANA is the native token on this innovative platform. The possibilities and applications it opens up to its users are truly limitless.\nThe Ethereum blockchain is the foundation for this digital currency. As the reputation of the metaverse expanded, there was an increase in the number of investors who purchased the token. Consequently, the cost of MANA skyrocketed at the beginning of 2022, increasing by more than fifty percent. Most of the market’s most prominent NFT exchanges also accept this cryptocurrency. It’s a common choice among the many out there when trying to buy and market NFTs.\nCollectixt Token intends to create an ecosystem in the cryptocurrency industry where users can be creative and unique. To accomplish this goal, the company will develop innovative platforms and an NFT marketplace where users can buy, sell, and auction off their one-of-a-kind NFTs.\nCollectixt is a token that combines the best features of the Polygon and Ethereum blockchain networks, including the networks’ rapid transaction confirmation times, high levels of consensus, and low transaction fees. In a bid to give artists from all walks of life a place to exhibit and sell their work for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Collectixt NFT marketplace was created. Purchasing works of art with NFTs is a terrific way to store value and a fantastic way to demonstrate ownership of the item.\nThe CLEX Token, which is Collectixt’s only token, is the governance token for the Collectixt ecosystem. On Collectixt, Token NFT was made to control and manage the whole ecosystem of the platform. There will never be more than 5,000,000 Token NFTs created.\nHolders of Collectixt tokens will not only be able to participate in governance, but they will also have access to specific ecosystem rights and protections that will not be available to non-holders. If you buy Collectixt during stage 2 of the presale, you will receive an additional 7% of CLEX tokens. If you decide to purchase Collectixt tokens during stage 1, you will receive an 8% bonus in CLEX tokens.\nPresale: https://signup.collectixt.com/register\nWebsite: https://collectixt.com/\nTelegram: https://t.me/CollectixtTokenOfficial\n","create_date":"2022-09-07T13:02:34+02:00","tag":"CLEX","author":""},

But can both projects keep up with ETFSwap (ETFS), the new kid in the block which houses a plethora of utilities?\nStarting with Ethereum (ETH) analysis, it is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and stands as a pioneer cryptocurrency, second to Bitcoin. Ethereum’s decentralized platform houses several utilities together with token standards that enable the creation and deployment of new tokens based on its token standard.\nA significant utility of the Ethereum (ETH) decentralized platform is its enabling ecosystem, which allows for the deployment of smart contracts by developers and builders. The blockahin also offers a safe and secure ecosystem for its users to carry out transactions and utilize its utility token Ether in payment of transaction fees otherwise known as “Gas Fees”.\nHowever, despite these innovative utilities and use cases Ethereum (ETH) offers on its platforms, more and more users are pitching tents in platforms with more efficient utilities such as ETFSwap (ETFS) due to the high congestion experienced on Ethereum and the resultant high gas fees, as well as the poor performance of its price which has failed to recover above $4,000.\nSolana(SOL) as a blockchain ecosystem and utility token has a fair share of unique utilities it offers to its host of users and adopters. Scalability and low transaction fees are unique utilities and features its platform and native token offers to end users.\nHowever, in recent times, the Solana(SOL) blockchain ecosystem has proven to be unreliable as a result of incessant blackouts, leading to longer transaction wait times and security breaches.ETFSwap (ETFS) is poised to be the new king of utility. Its price has also dropped from $200 and has failed to reach a new all-time high, prompting investors to seek better alternatives.\nLike never before, the cryptocurrency industry continues to scale at increasing momentum as utility tokens such as ETFSwap (ETFS) take the limelight in rolling out innovative solutions and utilities that meet the investment needs peculiar to each investor and user in the global finance ecosystem.\nAlthough ETFSwap (ETFS), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (FOL) possess unique utilities and selling points on their platforms, the quest to determine the king of utilities and the better platform is necessary to build investor confidence and bragging rights.\nThe emergence of ETFSwap (ETFS) in the global cryptocurrency markets has shown what is truly possible when it comes to disruptive technologies and utilities backed up by an ever-expanding community of users.\nDespite its relatively new entry into the global cryptocurrency markets, ETFSwap (ETFS) has proven to be ahead of its time by leveraging blockchain technology to tokenize crypto and traditional ETFs for trading on a completely decentralized platform. This incredible feat and milestone has placed ETFSwap in direct comparison with crypto giants Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), which has the best utility token and platform.\nETFSwap (ETFS) operates a decentralized platform that serves as a medium for users to trade exchange-traded funds on-chain. This means that users can securely engage in trading activities on the ETFSwap platform with no KYC requirements and privacy leaks. The ETFSwap platform also promotes a flexible in-house ecosystem that features multiple-choice investment options for users looking to invest in the health, transportation, energy, and technology sectors.\nTokenized ETFs are also a major unique selling point of the ETFSwap decentralized platform as it offers instant settlements and redemptions to users on the go, eradicating wait times associated with centralized exchanges and platforms.\nThe DeFi platform features a more robust utility and inclusive platform for users looking to explore various options that suit their investment needs. Its robust platform places it in front as a contender for “King of Utility”.\nOn a daily, more and more users are jumping on the bandwagon that ETFSwap (ETFS) as a decentralized platform provides. The over 23 million tokens sold currently on the ongoing ETFSwap presale is a testament to its ever-growing adopters who have found a gem in ETFSwap.\nSeveral crypto analysts have also forecasted ETFSwap to make a run similar to Shiba Inu in the 2021 bull cycle and Pepe’s bullish run in 2023. This would mean investors can easily turn a $5,000 investment into $5 million with this presale.\nETFSwap( ETFS) currently trades at a presale price of $0.00854. However, its current presale price is undervalued as the next stage of its presale is programmed to trade at a whopping $0.01831.\nFor more information about ETFS Presale\nVisit ETFSwap Presale\nJoin the ETFSwap Community\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions presented in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinCheckup.

BitPay: A Comparison Of Top Crypto Payment Solution - CoinCheckup","content":" Customers with cryptocurrencies are eager to use cryptocurrencies to make purchases online, send payments, and more. Businesses are equally as interested in capturing a portion of the crypto audience and establishing new revenue streams. However, there still remains a disconnect between companies and consumers.\nSwapin and BitPay are two top solutions for businesses and individuals that connect cryptocurrencies with traditional finance. Here is how the two companies and their product and service lineups compare.\nSwapin is a revolutionary service that aims to bridge the gap between the world of digital assets and the traditional financial sector. The user-friendly platform provides its users with a wide range of crypto-to-fiat solutions designed for both individuals and businesses.\nThe company also offers a solution for accepting crypto with automatic conversion to fiat without problems related to accounting, tax, and other financial compliance issues. Swapin tools for business open up the opportunity for companies to invoice for payment with digital assets. Online stores can also integrate a widget to accept payments in cryptocurrency.\nBitPay builds powerful, enterprise-grade tools for crypto acceptance and spending. Bitpay business tools let companies accept cryptocurrencies, gain new users, and avoid the high costs and chargebacks notoriously associated with credit cards. BitPay provides payment buttons, a hosted checkout, and embeddable invoices for any website.\nBitPay also lets companies bill customers via email and accept cryptocurrencies for conversion. There is even an NFT-focused tool for accepting cryptocurrencies in exchange for any NFTs you have created.\nSwapin offers two B2B tools primarily: CoinCollector and E-Com. By keeping it simple, businesses can focus on what matters: their customers and convenience. Using CoinCollector, companies can issue easy-to-use payment URLs with pre-filled information that makes paying for goods and services with crypto easier than it has ever been.\nE-Com provides an even more user-friendly experience by letting companies accept crypto on its website using a plug-and-play e-commerce widget. All Swapin tools instantly convert the cryptocurrencies into EUR or GBP and move them to the connected corporate IBAN account, eliminating the business risk associated with cryptocurrencies.\nBitPay offers similar solutions as Swapin. Online Payments lets businesses accept crypto on their website using a hosted checkout. Billing allows companies to receive coins via email, and BitPay Send makes sending crypto payments without holding crypto easy. The NFT product seems unnecessary when most artists list directly on apps like OpenSea.\nSwapin solutions for individuals include InstaPay, Predefined payments, and InstaFill. Soon, Swapin will introduce its InstaBuy crypto-purchasing tool offering fast access to top cryptocurrencies in a few clicks. InstaPay lets anyone send crypto to friends, family, and more, while Predefined payments use InstaPay in combination with templates to make recurring monthly payments for rent and other bills simple.\nInstaFill is the most convenient way for any crypto holder to access cash quickly. InstaFill connects a bank account with a unique Swapin crypto wallet. Each time funds hit the crypto wallet, the digital assets are instantly converted into fiat and moved to the connected bank account for convenience. Businesses can also access InstaFill to access petty cash or leverage other Swapin B2C tools.\nBitPay also offers several tools that let users spend their crypto assets in various ways. There is a card that turns crypto into cash, essentially acting as a debit card for crypto. There is also a wallet to secure and use crypto while on the go and a browser extension that lets users pay for items in crypto.\nBoth brands are helping to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance. Each company has slightly different tools which achieve similar goals. Ultimately, which company is best comes down to convenience. Businesses can easily accept crypto using Swapin CoinCollector or on a website with the E-Com e-commerce widget. Individuals have even more tools at their disposal to access cash quickly and easily or make instant crypto-to-fiat payments.\nEach company provides business customers and consumers with a high-quality suite of services and products. These solutions are helping to increase cryptocurrency adoption and bring new users to the technology.\n","create_date":"2022-09-08T11:14:55+02:00","tag":"BitPay","author":""},

It was launched earlier this year with a long-term narrative; however, an actual picture is more optimistic than anyone had expected. First, it marked a growth of 300% in token value during April 2024. Second, it has just banked a new ATH in token value and market cap. Finally, future predictions are bullish.\nWhat’s about to come is a massive surge of 200% in token value and a jump of almost $7 million in market cap. MAGA VP is predicted to exchange hands at $1.8 in a few days. Simultaneously, its market cap is expected to soar to $80 million from the current number of around $32 million. This is significant because Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are experiencing red trades for 24 hours.\nBitcoin has, so far, been able to make it out of its consolidation phase. This has brought a revised interest of investors and traders from across the globe. They continue to explore altcoins, especially meme coins, to diversify their crypto portfolios.\nThe current token value of MAGA VP is $0.67, up by 54.36% in the last 24 hours. The market cap is at $32 million at the time of writing this article. The token value further marks an upswing of 229.43% and 820.76% in the last 7 days and 30 days, respectively.\nIt has been able to defy odds and prevailing volatility plus uncertainty.\nMAGA VP remains committed to rewarding its holders with MAGA TRUMP. Hence, we are also coming out in support of $TRUMP holders who can exchange a single token for $9.43 right now. MVP is not directly associated with Donald Trump. Yet, it has been able to fuel a surge from his recent speech.\nDonald Trump had said that he was pro-crypto, unlike the current government which lacks basic understanding about cryptocurrency. Trump even went on to state that his supporters could contribute to his campaign using cryptocurrencies.\nMAGA VP is now aiming to bank the token value of $1.8 and the market cap of $80 million in the next few days. This is achievable along with the plan of forging multiple strategic partnerships, as mentioned on the roadmap.

These elements fundamentally shape the value, stability, and potential future performance of digital currencies. Two notable examples that illustrate the diversity in these models are SHIB (Shiba Inu) and XRP (Ripple). While SHIB emerged as a meme-inspired token with an unconventional approach to distribution, XRP represents a more structured, company-backed model, each offering unique insights into the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency economics. In this article, we’ll compare Shib vs XRP through these two elements. Let’s get closer to it.\nShiba Inu, popularly known as SHIB, started as a meme coin, echoing the footsteps of Dogecoin. However, its tokenomics reveal a more intricate picture. Initially, SHIB’s total supply was one quadrillion tokens. In a bold move, half of the supply was locked in Uniswap for liquidity, while the other half was famously burned by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, significantly reducing the circulating supply.\nThis act of burning a substantial portion of the supply created a deflationary aspect to SHIB’s tokenomics. Unlike traditional inflationary currencies, which decrease in value over time as more units are produced, SHIB’s value could potentially increase as the supply diminishes.\nXRP, on the other hand, presents a contrasting model. Developed by Ripple Labs, XRP was created to facilitate quick and efficient currency exchanges, including fiat and other cryptocurrencies. Unlike SHIB, XRP was pre-mined, with a total supply of 100 billion tokens, and Ripple Labs initially held a significant portion of this supply.\nRipple’s approach to distribution is more centralized. The company periodically releases portions of XRP from an escrow account, controlling the supply and, to an extent, its price stability. This model has drawn criticism for its centralized nature, but it also allows for strategic market interventions to maintain price stability and encourage adoption.\nThe market impact of these differing approaches is significant. SHIB’s community-driven, decentralized model has led to high volatility, often driven by social media and influencer endorsements. In contrast, XRP, through Ripple’s structured release schedule, aims for steady growth and long-term stability, making it more attractive to institutional investors and for cross-border payments solutions.\nSHIB’s deflationary model, where the supply decreases over time, can lead to price spikes as seen in its historical performance. However, this model also introduces unpredictability and susceptibility to market sentiments. XRP’s inflationary model, where the supply is controlled but not reduced, aims for a gradual increase in circulation, aligning with its goal of becoming a bridge currency in international finance.\nIn conclusion, SHIB and XRP showcase diverse strategies in the realm of cryptocurrency tokenomics and distribution. SHIB, with its community-focused, deflationary approach, offers a high-risk, high-reward scenario, often fueled by market trends and popular sentiment. XRP, in contrast, provides a more stable and controlled growth path, aligning with institutional usage and cross-border transactions.

However, ETFSwap (ETFS) has emerged as a solid contender amid exciting price predictions for the new platform’s token.\nAs speculation swirls around the growth trajectory of ETFSwap (ETFS), comparisons naturally arise with Chainlink (LINK) and Litecoin (LTC), both of which are considered established assets in the market.\nLitecoin (LTC) is having a terrific start to May, already outperforming rival mega-cap Proof of Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE). According to CoinMarketCap, the coin surged by 11% in the first few days in May, breaking the $80 local resistance while at it. Following the market recovery in the past few days, investors now set eyes on ambitious price targets above $100.\nWhile the Litecoin (LTC) price benefited from the larger crypto market uptick on Friday, a deeper examination of Litecoin’s trade data reveals that the Litecoin (LTC) rise has some underlying catalysts. Data from Santiment showed Litecoin (LTC) whales holding a cumulative balance of over 13.55 million LTC as of April 28. But rather than sell off as prices tumbled at the end of April, they capitalized on the dip to buy more LTC coins for cheap.\nAs of May 4, Whale wallet balances totaled 13.65 million, signalling an addition of over 100,000 LTC. Unsurprisingly, the recent activity coincides with the noticeable bullish trend on Litecoin (LTC).\nChainlink (LINK) remains a top pick for several crypto enthusiasts and experts as the network presents a crucial solution for the future of tokenized and real-world assets. Popular crypto analyst on X claimed to his followers that the TD Sequential is flashing a buy signal on the Chainlink (LINK) 12-hour chart. According to him, this sets a price target at around $15.50 for LINK as long as it stays above the major resistance level of $13.87.\nTD Sequential is a technical indicator used to predict market reversals. Thomas DeMark created it, and it is famous among traders because it can provide alerts based on the exhaustion of existing price movements.\nSeveral experts agree with the bullish forecast on Chainlink (LINK), considering the emerging market narrative for real-world assets. However, ETFSwap (ETFS) has been arguably the most impressive crypto asset in the market this year, and enthusiasts wonder if Chainlink (LINK) and Litecoin (LTC) can keep up.\nETFSwap (ETFS) knocks expectations out of the gate as the presale shocks investors. In just Stage 1 of its presale, the project has raised over $350,000 after an initial $750,000 was secured from private rounds featuring institutional and angel investors.\nETFSwap (ETFS) is an emerging platform for trading ETF assets on-chain by tokenizing these traditional assets and bringing them to the blockchain. These assets are backed by real securities purchased from traditional finance markets and enable several ETFSwap (ETFS) platform features.\nThis new platform combines the best features of traditional and crypto markets by offering market-making opportunities, perpetual trading with up to 10x leverage, easy conversion between ETFs and cryptocurrencies, access to liquidity, and many more.\nThe emergence of ETFSwap (ETFS) benefits from the growing popularity of tokenized blockchain assets. BlackRock, along with other giant finance firms, has shown interest in tokenizing funds and other assets on-chain following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This market is projected to be worth $10 trillion by 2030, which puts ETFSwap (ETFS) in position for massive growth as an early market participant.\nThis puts ETFSwap (ETFS) on a pedestal as the new tokenized ETF platform continues smashing milestones on presale. With the level of excitement and bullishness surrounding the project, this is as early as it gets for ETFSwap (ETFS), and investors can’t miss out on the excitement this presents.\nThe ETFSwap (ETFS) Stage 1 presale is selling at $0.00854, a price point that crypto experts say is an undervalued entry for investors.\nFor more information about the ETFS Presale:\nVisit ETFSwap Presale\nJoin The ETFSwap Community\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions presented in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinCheckup.

It’s a problem that the crypto industry desperately needs to address if digital assets are to become a standard payment mechanism, as it simply won’t do when someone is forced to pay $20 in fees for a $3 cup of coffee.\nFortunately, a new breed of “smart” crypto wallets such as Ambire Wallet have created a great little solution to the problem of expensive gas fees, enabling users to pre-pay these transaction costs and ensure they’ll never be charged over the odds.\nAt present, gas fees on the Ethereum network cost around 49 gwei (1 gwei is the smallest denomination in ETH, with 1,000,000,000 gwei = 1 ETH). That works out at around $4.70 at the current rate. While that’s not going to be a problem for someone swapping thousands of dollars’ worth of ETH tokens on an exchange, it’s a ridiculous amount to pay for those who are transacting smaller amounts.\nEvery smart contract blockchain has its own formula for calculating gas fees. In the case of Ethereum, the most popular smart contract chain, the exact cost of its gas fees fluctuates based on network activity. When the network is slow, gas fees will be relatively low, but during times of network congestion, the fees can shoot up to astonishing amounts.\nThe Ethereum Foundation has published an article explaining how gas fees are calculated, and suffice to say, they do become very expensive at times of increased network activity. For instance, there have been times when crypto traders have paid a staggering 43% in gas fees, such as when one trader stumped up 64.01 ETH in fees to send 148 ETH. That works out at about $224,000 in transaction costs at the current market rate.\nThese kinds of crazy gas fees are surprisingly common, especially when highly anticipated events such as major NFT drops occur. For instance, when the Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs debuted its Otherdeed NFT collection, it sold out for $320 million. But the demand was so high that users collectively spent almost $180 million in gas fees to ensure their transaction went through and they could claim their coveted NFT.\nThis is why the ability to pay for gas fees in advance could be a gamechanger for many crypto users. Ambire Wallet is one of a new generation of smart crypto wallets that enables users to pre-pay their gas fees ahead of time, guaranteeing that they won’t be forced to pay exorbitant fees during times of high demand.\nAmbire Wallet’s “Gas Tank” can be compared to the discounted rates offered to consumers by streaming service provides like Netflix, which charge lower than the monthly rate if the user pays for a yearly subscription up front. With the Gas Tank, users can deposit their gas fees ahead of time, paying in either ETH, MATIC or various stablecoins. In doing this, users can save up to 5,000 gwei on Ethereum transactions and 20,000 gwei when using other ERC20 blockchains.\nThe Gas Tank takes advantage of something called the “Relayer”, which is a backend service that broadcasts transactions to blockchain validators. The Relayer was originally designed as a gas fee abstraction mechanism that enables users to pay their gas fees in any token, rather than just ETH.\nUsing the Gas Tank, Ambire Wallet can make a single deposit to the Relayer’s address in order to obtain “credit” that can be used to pay the gas for multiple transactions, rather than paying for each single transaction. By effectively pre-paying their gas fees, users can secure a much lower price.\nThere are several reasons why prepaying gas fees is a smart idea, especially for those who regularly perform crypto transactions. The main reason is that users can plan their budgets better. If someone knows in advance that they need to make a certain amount of transactions each month, for example, they can deposit their gas fees for that entire month earlier, so they will know exactly what their transaction costs will be. They can then plan their budgets accordingly.\nBy paying ahead of time, users can also secure a much lower rate in case the network happens to be congested at the exact moment they need to perform a transaction. This makes sense because network spikes can be unpredictable. After all, lots of crypto users don’t pay any attention to what hot NFT drops are just around the corner, so they won’t realize that gas prices are set to spike just as they’re planning to buy their groceries using a crypto credit card, for example.\nWhile everyone else will have to choose between paying hundreds of dollars in fees or delaying their transaction until the network calms down, Ambire Wallet users can go right ahead and complete their transaction, without worrying about the fee.\nSaver-style crypto users will also get a sense of proactive gratification thanks to the Gas Tank’s Cashback feature. Each time the user requests a transaction, they’ll see an estimated fee that’s based on the gas rate at the time the transaction is made. But because they have paid in advance, the user will often be charged much less gas than this estimate. The difference is then returned to the user.\nWhile features such as the ability to set your own gas limits have helped users to avoid paying expensive rates, they can’t really be considered as a solution since all they do is stop the transaction from being processed. But there are times when users cannot afford to wait. By prepaying your gas fees ahead of time, you will no longer have to.\n","create_date":"2024-05-16T12:21:51+02:00","tag":"Ambire","author":""},

Syntax marks the manifestation of the Agent Economy in Web3.\nToday, Spectral Labs has launched Syntax, a new LLM enabling people to ship agents that automate onchain projects and tasks, thereby manifesting their Web3 product ideas. While still in beta, Syntax’s vision is to create an open onchain Agent Economy, where developers, individuals, and enterprises can for the first time select the agents they would want to delegate their Web3 tasks, projects, and product development to. These projects and products include production grade smart contracts, arbitrage agents, NFTs, rollups, and more.\nScaling web3 engineering efforts and shipping new onchain products is limited by the number of solidity developers, as well as enterprises’ ability to test and ship smart contract code in a fast and effective way without burning through engineering resources.\nSpectral has set out to solve this with its new LLM, Syntax, a development environment designed to manifest Web3 product ideas by converting natural language into Solidity code that can be deployed instantly onchain. For professional developers, Syntax can accelerate and optimize bandwidth by writing large libraries and components.\nSyntax provides an Agentic experience, where users tell Syntax what they want to build, and Syntax writes and deploys the code onchain at the click of a button. Spectral defines an Onchain Agent as a set of instructions and code capable of deploying itself onchain and possessing a dedicated provisioned wallet for doing so. Loosely similar to custom instructions in ChatGPT, Syntax Agents also have their own identity and can autonomously figure out ways to interact with deployment infrastructure.\nWith Syntax, users can compile, debug, and deploy AI-generated solidity code. Syntax gives users and the industry the ability to quickly test, ship and scale new products, as well as determining the usability and functional relevance of the code generated while also giving them control to quickly edit code snippets. Initially, Spectral’s Onchain Agents will be curated and built by Spectral, but soon every user will be able to create their own Agent and monetize it in future Syntax releases.\n“At Spectral, we’re pioneering a future where autonomous Agents redefine what’s possible onchain. With Spectral Syntax, we empower these agents to operate independently, making it simpler for everyone to bring their blockchain ideas to life.” – Sishir Varghese, Founder.\nWhat truly sets Syntax apart is its capability to deploy code directly onchain, executing deployments through Foundry by writing instructions that Foundry can process, including code compilation, onchain deployment, and signing transactions. Syntax is pioneering an accessible onchain Agent Economy, inviting users to select agents tailored for their specific Web3 tasks. Users can either interact with the foundational agent or opt for one of the specialized agents, each adept in distinct tasks and operations—like the Code Forker assistant, ideal for those aiming to fork and customize a codebase. Additionally, users can discern an agent’s expertise and trustworthiness by reviewing its category listing and the popularity reflected through its user engagement.\n“Syntax by Spectral is at the forefront of merging AI with web3, pioneering the onchain agent economy and making it easier and more accessible for users to create their own blockchain products,” said Josh Rosenthal, Partner, Polychain\nSyntax produces accurate and gas-optimized Solidity code for a variety of prompts ranging from low to medium complexity, and it outperforms baseline models on Spectral’s Solidity evaluation dataset. As Spectral’s modeling efforts continue to evolve, the company expects Syntax to deliver optimized code for increasingly complex problems. These Solidity models are explicitly designed to assist developers in writing optimized, modern, well-tested, and secure code.\nAbout Spectral\nSpectral, a pioneer of the agent economy behind Syntax, is at the forefront of integrating AI with blockchain to democratize development in Web3. Our mission is to simplify the creation and deployment of decentralized applications through autonomous Onchain Agents. Syntax, Spectral’s flagship product, translates natural language into Solidity code, enabling both novices and experts to build on the blockchain effortlessly. With a commitment to transparency and user empowerment, Spectral is shaping a future where anyone can participate in the blockchain revolution.

Launched quietly on a Saturday by MetaWin’s founder, Skel, the rise of $ROCKY has achieved growth without the benefit of prior hype or a pre-sale event. Surprisingly, even the internal MetaWin team was unaware of the launch, waking up to the news only as it began trending among users in the Arena Discord.\nSkel promptly rallied a task force from MetaWin’s 80-strong team to devise a robust strategy for $ROCKY’s future. Enhancements have been rapid and impactful, with the team securing a partnership with a renowned Hollywood art studio to bolster their social media campaigns, integrating $ROCKY into MetaWin’s platform for token-gated competitions, and leveraging their in-house network of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) effectively.\nIn a bold move on X (formerly Twitter), Skel projected a $100 million market cap for $ROCKY, offering to provide exit liquidity at a $5 million valuation – a commitment that saw the token’s price quadruple within just ten hours.\n“The wider market was downtrending, and $ROCKY was initially part of that slump. I dislike seeing our community disheartened. Although I was undecided about throwing our full support behind the project, at MetaWin, when we commit, we go all in,” stated Skel. “Seeing the enthusiasm from our community has solidified $ROCKY as MetaWin’s unofficial meme coin, and we are now unified in the vision of reaching a $100 million market cap.”\nThis Friday’s prize draw, a staple event on the MetaWin platform, is now valued at $15,000 due to the value of the $ROCKY prizes.\n“With the formidable team we have and the unwavering support of the MetaWin community, I believe we can achieve extraordinary things. $ROCKY is now the fastest growing meme coin in the history of the Base chain. While the road ahead is promising, with potential to scale towards the likes of Pepe’s $3 billion market cap, we always remind our community about the high-risk nature of cryptocurrency investments,” Skel added.\n\nThe inception of $ROCKY drew its initial spark from an unlikely source – a picture of Skel’s Pomeranian, also named Rocky, perched on a pile of money. This image, processed through ChatGPT’s DALL-E AI image generator, became the inaugural graphic identity for the token across social media and various DEX tools.\nIn a display of commitment to the coin’s longevity and their community’s trust, the MetaWin team has locked up their token allocation for a minimum of one year, ensuring that they stand firmly alongside their community in this venture.\nAs $ROCKY’s journey continues, the market watches with anticipation, marking an extraordinary chapter in the annals of cryptocurrency’s vibrant history. With its current trajectory, $ROCKY is not just a token; it’s a testament to what the community can achieve when united behind a visionary leader and an innovative project.\nUsers can participate in $ROCKY daily competitions on BASE or with an NFT purchase.\nFor the latest updates and to embark on the $ROCKY journey users can visit www.RockyCoinbase.com or X.com/rockycoinbase.\nAbout MetaWin:\nFounded by Skel, MetaWin stands as the premier platform for on-chain prize competitions and instant win games, offering a diverse array of entertaining challenges for users.

Copy trading lets you automatically replicate the positions of the top traders on Bitget who have a proven track record after thorough screening by the platform.\nRather than endlessly searching for the next big coin or timing the market, follow traders specializing in strategies like scalping, day trading, grid trading and more based on your preferred niche and risk tolerance. Many of the top traders can achieve returns of over 100% annually.\nTo get started, search traders by filter options like their rating, followers, and profit/loss percentage. Then choose your preferred trading pairs and leverage before activating the copy. Set appropriate risk controls and you’re now benefiting from the “wisdom of the crowd”.\nWhile borrowing can exponentially grow your profits, the associated risks must be appropriately managed. Futures contracts on Bitget offer up to 125x leverage on major coins like BTC and ETH, magnifying even small price movements. Pair this high leverage with solid risk management practices.\nSome tips include only risking 1-2% of your account per trade, placing stop losses, and hedging positions to limit the downside during volatility. The cross-margin mode lets you utilize your entire futures balance as a margin while the isolated margin calculates risk independently on each position.\nYou can also trade larger spot volumes through Bitget’s margin trading feature with up to 10x leverage. Maintain a positive funding rate, watch your liquidation price, and scale into larger positions slowly as your skills and market awareness improve over time.\nDiamond hands are rewarded on Bitget through a selection of savings and staking options. The flexible Bitcoin Savings product lets you lock BTC for a set period to earn daily compound interest of up to 15% APY.\nAlternatively, stake BGB governance tokens to receive trading fee discounts and participate in project governance. Strategically parking funds in stablecoin savings at 8-15% APY is another smart way to generate risk-free returns while retaining upside market potential.\nThese features are perfect for long-term holding strategies and empower users to earn income from their digital asset holdings instead of relying only on price appreciation. Consider setting aside a small portion of your portfolio for such passive income streams.\nThe strategy trading module on Bitget unleashes automation potential by offering ready-made algorithms and templates designed by expert traders. Options span grid, mean reversion, and DCA blueprints optimized for coins like ETH and BTC.\nAutomating repetitive tasks through these bots allows setting and forgetting positions according to pre-programmed rules like scaling in or out. For ultimate flexibility, advanced users can also build entirely custom strategies using variables and conditional logic.\nAutomation streamlines the process, upholds prudent risk controls, and diligently backtests strategies on paper before activating with real funds to avoid potential pitfalls. Monitor performance closely over different market conditions as well.\nBitget brings a user-friendly experience paired with powerful advanced services that appeal to all experience levels. From spot trading basics to leveraged derivatives, you can grow and fine-tune your skills while Bitget’s comprehensive security safeguards protect your digital assets.\nTools like copy trading remove the need to predict short-term market nuances, while strategy automation executes intricate plans systematically. Always deploy prudent risk management according to your specific goals and circumstances.\nBy understanding and leveraging Bitget’s full suite holistically through practices outlined here, traders of any experience level can stay one step ahead of the competition and consistently trade smarter.\n","create_date":"2023-12-07T14:03:34+02:00","tag":"Cryptocurrency Exchange","author":""},

Together with the team, CoinCheckup explores what makes BlackFort one of the most interesting projects in the market.","title":"Interview With BlackFort Exchange Network Founders: “Our NFT-Based L1 Delegation is the First of Its Kind” - CoinCheckup","content":" A Layer-1 network with unique NFT-based delegation, a client-side multicurrency wallet, BXN token, an RWA platform, a financial services platform — all these products are part of the BlackFort ecosystem. Together with the team, CoinCheckup explores what makes BlackFort one of the most interesting projects in the market.\nStefan Huber, CEO: BlackFort is a suite of products that cover the whole spectrum of Web3. On the side of infrastructure, we offer an L1 blockchain, BlackFort Exchange Network, with a pioneering consensus algorithm – Proof of Staked Authority, and special delegator NFTs. We also have a multichain wallet with built-in fiat ramps and swaps, and soon we’ll release a real estate tokenization platform and a financial services solution, BlackFort Pay. All of these products are linked to the $BXN token.\nLucas G. Hubert, COO: People are using it already, actually – we have almost 1.5 million transactions and 130,000 active addresses on the BlackFort blockchain. Our objective launching this L1 was to make participation in blockchain accessible to all – and here I mean participation as a validator and/or delegator, and the rewards that come with it. With other L1 chains, we see that only a tiny number of users benefit from block production – but with BlackFort, any user can easily become a delegator or even a validator.\nStefan Huber, CEO: Indeed. In Proof-of-Staked Authority consensus, validators have to both stake $BXN and maintain a good reputation. This is a more efficient and democratic solution than simply requiring a huge stake that only whales can afford.\nBut my favorite feature are Node NFTs, or nNFTs. To become a delegator, you need to purchase this NFT, which is actually a bundle of BXN tokens wrapped into an NFT. People like NFTs, so using them makes the whole concept of delegation more approachable. The maximum number of nNFTs is capped at 304,000 – I think BlackFort is the only L1 that caps the number of delegators. This gives more prestige to the role. We’ve already sold 175,000 of these nNFTs, so the demand is huge.\nLucas G. Hubert, COO: A share in the block rewards and transaction fees, both in BXN tokens. We already have 165,000 delegations from 120 countries. NFT-based delegation is launching very soon, so users should get their nNFTs as soon as possible.\nMario Urschitz, CIO: Right – the wallet actually supports many chains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. The strongest feature of the wallet, in my opinion, is the integration of a Web3 antivirus. It can scan a smart contract or an address and tell you right away if it’s safe to connect or send crypto to it. Of course, the wallet also has an integrated fiat on- and off-ramp solution, as well as mu\nmultichain swaps. I personally use it every day, and I’m proud of this product.\nMario Urschitz, CIO: Yes, we’ve built a platform for tokenizing real estate. It comes with a robust compliance framework – BlackFort has already obtained the required licenses, and in a few weeks we should be ready to release the first version of the product.\nBy the way, our decision to launch an RWA platform isn’t due to the hype around tokenizing real-world assets. We have always combined on-chain infrastructure with real-world applications, so RWA is the logical next step. I have an extensive track record with crypto compliance and blockchain-based securities, so the necessary expertise is already there.\nLucas G. Hubert, COO: We are excited about BlackFort Pay, our new financial services platform. It will link Web3 payments with the world of traditional finance – we’ll offer debit cards, online bank accounts, a payment processing solution, tools for buying and selling crypto for fiat, and much more. We’re planning to release it in Q3.\nOn the on-chain front, we are working on a native DEX for BlackFort Exchange Network. It will be the first major dApp in the ecosystem. You can find details on our roadmap page.\nMario Urschitz, CIO: Of course! Right now $BXN is used for validator staking and delegation, it is wrapped in nNFTs, and it’s also the currency of the block rewards and transaction fees on the L1. For the BlackFort wallet users, it has a different kind of utility: cashback for various types of wallet transactions, such as buying crypto. $BXN holders will also be entitled to airdrops, whitelist spots, and other perks – plus discounts and incentives on the RWA and payment platforms, once they are released.\nLucas G. Hubert, COO: Four big exchanges for now: Gate.io, MEXC, Bitfinex, and LBank. But we are working on additional listings. You’ll also be able to trade it on the upcoming BlackFort DEX.\nStefan Huber, CEO: Yes, definitely. From the start, BlackFort aimed to remove entry barriers, to make crypto accessible. For example, if you’ve never been a validator or delegator, it will be much easier for you to join BlackFort X Network with an nNFT than other L1s. And if you’ve never had a wallet, our multichain wallet is much easier than having lots of wallets for different blockchains. BlackFort Pay and the RWA platform follow the same approach – let users enter different niches in Web3 without unnecessary complexities.\nStefan Huber, CEO: We’ve followed very diverse paths into crypto. I started BTC mining when I was still in college, over 10 years ago. Combined with my background in IT development, it helped me found BlackFort four years ago. Our COO Lucas Hubert came from a corporate environment and offers unique expertise that few people in Web3 have. And our Chief Investment Officer Mario Urschitz co-founded a number of important blockchain projects: a large crypto education platform, a mining facility, and even an exchange for security tokens. Having such diverse backgrounds helped us make BlackFort what it is today – a unique all-in-one ecosystem where each and every crypto user can find what they need.\nMore about BlackFort: https://blackfort.exchange/\n","create_date":"2024-05-03T12:00:00+02:00","tag":"BlackFort Exchange Network","author":""},

In this article, we’ll explore a long-term Cardano price prediction for 2040 and 2050 to see how high the ADA price could go in the future.\nCardano is a blockchain project that was founded in 2015, raising $62 million through an ICO to fund development. The founder of Cardano is American entrepreneur Charles Hoskinson, who first became known in the world of crypto and blockchain as one of the co-founders of Ethereum.\nCardano’s mainnet was launched in September 2017, initially with limited capabilities. Over the years, it has undergone several updates to increase its decentralization and add important features such as a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and the ability to support smart contracts.\nADA, the native digital currency of the Cardano ecosystem, is utilized for transaction fees and as a reward mechanism for validators who contribute to the network’s security. The blockchain is powered by a scientifically vetted Proof-of-Stake protocol known as Ouroboros.\nWhat sets Cardano apart from other blockchain platforms with smart contract capabilities is its implementation of the EUTXO (Extended Unspent Transaction Output) model for its transactions.\nAdditionally, Cardano’s choice of the Haskell programming language as the basis for its Plutus smart contracts enables formal verification, highlighting the Cardano project’s focus on security and reliability.\nCardano is among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today, and has a market capitalization of over $20 billion. Although ADA is still ranked in the crypto 10, it has been outperformed recently by other top crypto assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.\nAs we can see in the image below, ADA has gained 70.3% in the last year, while Bitcoin gained 150% in the same time period. Solana, another competitor in the smart contracts sector, has increased by a massive 778%.\nCardano’s all-time high came in September 2021, when ADA hit a peak of $2.92. The coin then endured an extreme price correction, reaching a bottom of $0.24 in December of 2022. Cardano’s recovery began in 2023, and has so far peaked at $0.75.\nNotably, Cardano is still down nearly 80% from its all-time high, even though Bitcoin has already managed to improve upon the all-time high it set during the 2021 crypto market bull run.\nTo begin with, we should clarify that forecasting the long-term performance of any asset is very difficult, especially when we’re dealing with the highly volatile and unpredictable cryptocurrency market. Therefore, it’s not reasonable to expect a high degree of accuracy when attempting to predict the price movements of a cryptocurrency over multiple decades.\nStill, we can get an idea of how ADA could perform as a long-term crypto investment over a long by using the growth rates of well-established investments as a benchmark.\nHere is a table of what the ADA price would be in 2040 and 2050 if it grew at the same rate as various other investments.\nWhen looking for realistic price targets for ADA, we need to keep to consider what the implications would be for the coin’s market capitalization.\nThe maximum supply of ADA coins that can exist is 45 billion. We should note that not all ADA coins are in circulation yet, as the current circulating supply is roughly 33.8 billion. However, we’ll be using the maximum supply of 45 billion in our calculations.\nSo, while a price target such as $100 might not seem too unreasonable at first glance, it would imply a market capitalization of $4.5 trillion for ADA. This would make it worth more than Microsoft ($3.1 trillion), which is currently the world’s most valuable company.\nNow, let’s take a look at long-term Cardano price forecasts from crypto data aggregator CoinCodex. Please keep in mind that these are algorithmic price predictions that are fully based on price history and current market dynamics, and don’t take into account any fundamentals or real-world events.\nCurrently, the Cardano price prediction for 2040 is suggesting that ADA could reach as high as $28.08 by 2040. Based on the maximum supply of ADA, this would imply a market capitalization of $1.26 trillion, which is comparable to the market capitalization of Bitcoin at the time of this article. So, while it’s difficult to say that such a price target is realistic for Cardano, there is at least precedent for a cryptocurrency succesfully reaching such a market cap.\nThis Cardano price forecast expects the ADA price to go through several cycles between now and 2040, peaking at $3.18, $6.39, $11.03, $19.36 and $28.08, respectively.\nAs far as the Cardano price forecast for 2050, the prediction is expecting ADA to hit a peak of $93.17. This would correspond to a market capitalization of $4.18 trillion, which would be unprecedented compared to the history of the cryptocurrency market so far. So far, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has reached its highest peak at roughly $2.67 trillion.\nUnless there are major shakeups in the crypto markets, we can expect Cardano to continue being one of the leading projects in the sector. The project has an engaged community, is consistently seeing technical upgrades, and is based on unique technologies that differentiate it from other smart contract-enabled blockchain platforms.\nIf you’re looking to keep exploring the crypto markets, make sure to take a look at our list of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.\n","create_date":"2024-03-28T19:40:55+02:00","tag":"ADA","author":""},

Investors searching for potential gains are turning their attention to these alternatives, as their prices suggest a big movement on the horizon. This article delves into the reasons behind their imminent rise and highlights which ones might be the next to soar. It’s a crucial time for anyone looking to expand their portfolio.\nBlastUP has been getting a lot of attention lately thanks to its high potential to become a major force in the crypto industry. This pioneering launchpad on Blast has already attracted over 15,000 active users.\nThe ongoing presale of BlastUP is a huge success, more than $6 million raised so far. The BlastUP token is considered by crypto experts as a hidden crypto gem that can skyrocket 1000% by the end of this year.\nBlastUP helps crypto startups grow faster and earn more. As BlastUP forges ahead, it remains committed to creating a global hub for the Blast community. BlastUP is rapidly gaining traction for the benefit of all participants in this ecosystem.\nBlastUP’s roadmap extends into 2026, promising the introduction of AI-driven tools and the Community Marketplace, further enriching the ecosystem’s capabilities.\nThe BlastUP token, a cornerstone of the platform, unlocks access to tiered IDO launches, staking rewards, and exclusive loyalty benefits.\nThe market sentiment around Celestia appears balanced with a cautious optimism for growth, as its current trends show a steady position within familiar territory after a period of modest decline. Stability in key performance areas suggests a holding pattern, while the past growth hints at underlying resilience. Given Celestia’s fundamentals—such as potential technology upgrades or community support—any shifts in general market moods or investor interest could tilt the scale, potentially driving Celestia towards a more positive trajectory in the foreseeable future.\nDespite a recent dip in value, Osmosis appears to be holding its ground, with early indications of stability around its current pricing. The market is sending mixed signals, marked by a cautious optimism that is counterbalanced by an undercurrent of uncertainty. Traders seem hesitant, offering room for the coin’s strengths—like its role in facilitating asset exchanges across different blockchains—to potentially encourage a positive shift in momentum, as long as the broader crypto market maintains a supportive environment for growth.\nLooking at the potential for price increase among altcoins, TIA, and OSMO show promise but might not see massive growth in the short term. Instead, the spotlight is on BlastUP, which stands out with its strong concept and position within the Blast ecosystem. Based on current analysis, BlastUP’s potential for a significant price surge looks higher than its peers. The coin’s affiliation with the successful Blast platform suggests it could be a wise pick for those looking to invest in this bull run.\nSite: https://blastup.io/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Blastup_io\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/5Kc3nDhqVW\nTelegram: https://t.me/blastup_io\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions presented in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinCheckup.

Realistically, however, you need to make a significant investment in ASIC miners to mine 1 Bitcoin in a reasonable period of time.\nCurrently, the Bitcoin block reward is 3.25 BTC. If you set up a solo Bitcoin miner and got extremely lucky, you would be able to earn 3.25 BTC in about 10 minutes after you started mining. However, it’s important to understand that this scenario is highly unlikely unless you made a very large investment into Bitcoin mining hardware.\nSince Bitcoin mining is extremely competitive and the Bitcoin protocol releases 100% of the block reward to a single miner, most miners would never earn any BTC if they didn’t join a mining pool.\nIf a miner that’s part of a given mining pool receives a block reward, the reward is split across all miners in that pool, proportional to the amount of hashrate they are contributing to the pool. For example, if you contributed 10% of the pool’s hashrate and another miner in your pool found a block, you would receive 10% of the 3.125 BTC reward (0.3125 BTC).\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is entirely public, which means we have access to all the information required to calculate roughly how long it would take to mine 1 Bitcoin in various scenarios.\nBy knowing a mining pool’s average hashrate in a given time period and how many Bitcoin blocks they mined during that period, we can arrive at a rough estimate of how much hashrate is required to mine 1 BTC in that period.\nFor example, let’s calculate how much hashrate we would need to mine 1 BTC in 1 day on average.\nFoundry, which is currently the biggest Bitcoin mining pool in the world, mined 306 blocks in the last 7 days, which translates to 956 BTC in rewards. By dividing this figure with 7, we see that they earned 136.6 BTC per day on average in the last week.\nTherefore, you would need 1 / 136.6 (equivalent to 0.7%) of Foundry’s hashrate if you wanted to mine 1 BTC per day on average. The average hashrate of the Foundry mining pool in the last 7 days was 187.9 EH/s, and 0.7% of that figure is 1.31 EH/s. This is how much hashrate you would need to be able to mine 1 BTC per day on average.\nReaching that level of hashrate requires a very large investment. As an example, let’s take the Bitmain Antminer S21 ASIC miner, which produces 200 TH/s and is listed at a price of $5,400 by the manufacturer (prices can vary depending on the merchant).\nTo achieve the 1.31 EH/s that is currently required to mine 1 BTC in a day on average, you would need 6,550 Antminer S21 miners, which would require an investment of $35 million.\nNow, let’s take a quick look at the following table to get a better idea of how fast you can mine Bitcoin assuming different investment amounts into ASIC miners:\nThese calculations are based on the difficulty of mining Bitcoin as of May 15, 2024 and the assumption that the miner being used is the Antminer S21, which produces 200 TH/s and is listed at a price of $5,400 by the manufacturer.\nIt’s also important to stress that the calculations above don’t account for other costs of mining Bitcoin, such as electricity, maintenance, cooling and the space where the miners are located. Accounting for these costs would drive the investment amounts required to mine 1 BTC in a given time period substantially higher.\nThe Bitcoin mining landscape has become even more competitive lately following the Bitcoin halving, which happened on April 19, 2024. The halving reduced the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\nEven though the Bitcoin mining difficult has dropped recently, it’s still roughly at the levels we saw in March. This means that mining a Bitcoin block still requires about the same amount of resources as it did in March, but yields half the rewards, which puts significant pressure on less efficient Bitcoin mining operations.\nWithout specialized Bitcoin mining hardware, it’s nearly impossible to mine 1 Bitcoin in any reasonable timeframe. For example, trying to mine Bitcoin with a standard gaming GPU won’t work due to the high level of competition in Bitcoin mining.\nSolo mining (mining Bitcoin without joining a mining pool) is more akin to gambling in a lottery than a reliable income source, unless you operate a large-scale mining farm with hundreds or thousands of rigs. The most feasible way to earn through Bitcoin mining is by joining a mining pool, which still requires a significant investment in proper mining hardware to make sense financially.\nThe reason why it’s so difficult to make any profits with solo mining is because the Bitcoin protocol awards each block reward to only one miner. For example, if you controlled just 0.0001% of the total Bitcoin network’s hashrate, you would only have a 0.0001% chance of receiving a reward as each block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain.\nJoining a mining pool provides a much more predictable stream of revenue. When any miner in your pool successfully mines a block, you would receive a portion of the Bitcoin reward, proportional to the amount of hashrate you contribute.\nWith Bitcoin being priced north of $60,000 at the time of writing this article, it’s no surprise that mining 1 Bitcoin is far from a trivial task.\nThe recent Bitcoin halving has heated up the competition in the Bitcoin mining industry even further, which means that mining only makes sense for miners that can achieve the highest levels of efficiency through low electricity costs, highly effective cooling solutions or other competitive advantages.\nIf you don’t want to make a significant investment of money and time into Bitcoin mining, it will likely result in a financial loss. Of course, if you want to engage in mining simply from a hobbyist perspective, the financial aspect is less important.\nIf you want to explore an alternative way of investing into Bitcoin mining, make sure to take a look at our list of the best Bitcoin mining companies to invest in for 2024.\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T14:17:47+02:00","tag":"ASIC","author":""},

These whales are known to play a massive role in a token’s price discovery, and their purchases could lead to a significant price surge for the meme coins.\nETFSwap (ETFS) is another crypto token that recently witnessed a surge in whale activity. This category of large investors has purchased millions of the ETFSwap (ETFS) tokens in its ongoing presale.\nOn-chain data shows that crypto whales have accumulated over 624 billion Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens in the last 24 hours. Specifically, one wallet address (0x10Dc) bought 241.6 billion PEPE ($1.75 million) and 53 billion SHIB ($1.27 million).\nMeanwhile, another whale is seen to have withdrawn 329.3 billion Pepe (PEPE) from crypto exchanges Binance and MEXC. Whales taking their crypto holdings off exchanges is considered bullish, as it most likely means they are choosing to hold for the long term instead of selling anytime soon.\nShiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) prices reacted positively to this development. Shiba Inu (SHIB) rose to as high as $0.00002461 in the last 24 hours, while Pepe (PEPE) climbed to as high as $0.000007583 during the same period.\nIt is also worth noting that both meme coins have recorded a surge in their trading volume, suggesting that investors (besides whales) are also actively trading these tokens.\nData from CoinMarketCap shows that Pepe’s (PEPE) trading volume rose by over 30% in the last 24 hours, while Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) trading volume also increased by over 35%.\nInvestors looking to invest in both meme coins now may have to be cautious, given their strong positive correlation with Bitcoin’s price. With Bitcoin currently dumping, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) have followed suit. Both crypto tokens are currently trading at around $0.00002237 and $0.000006781, down over 5% and 3% in the last 24 hours, respectively.\nMeanwhile, ETFSwap (ETFS) has shown green flags all around, prompting Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) whales to invest heavily in its presale.\nNewcomer ETFSwap (ETFS) is seeing a large influx of crypto whales come into its ecosystem. These whales alone have bought over 60 million ETFSwap (ETFS) tokens in stage 1 of the ongoing presale. These crypto investors say that they see the crypto token as a high-conviction play, having seen how bullish crypto experts are bullish on it.\nThese crypto experts say that ETFSwap (ETFS) could rise to as high as $5, a 58,000% gain from its current price of $0.00854. Meanwhile, ETFSwap (ETFS) has shown its strength in the crypto market, with its value skyrocketing despite the recent marketwide downtrend, which has overwhelmed other altcoins.\nETFSwap’s (ETFS) impressive price action amidst this downtrend has convinced even more investors that investing in the crypto token may indeed be the best play for this bull run. It is worth noting that ETFS has managed this run without even factoring that it is the native token of ETFSwap, a Real World Asset (RWA) crypto project.\nRWA projects are projected to soon become the leading narrative in the crypto space, especially with asset tokenization expected to become a trillion-dollar market soon enough. That means tokens like ETFSwap (ETFS) will see a massive inflow of liquidity, which would cause a further spike in their prices.\nMoreover, ETFSwap (ETFS) stands out with its unique offering, as it will be the first decentralized finance (DeFi) platform to offer tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As such, Web3 natives looking to invest in this class of traditional assets will ultimately flock to the platform.\nETFS tokens are required to access investment opportunities on the platform, which is another reason why the token is recording increased demand in its ongoing presale. Although stage 1 of the presale is still ongoing, it is expected to end sooner than the scheduled date. That means those who have yet to invest need to act if they want to make maximum gains from this alpha.\nThe tokens are currently selling for an affordable price of $0.00854 in the first stage of the presale, but the price is scheduled to jump 100% to $0.01831 in the second stage, making this the best time to invest.\nFor more information about the ETFS Presale:\nVisit ETFSwap Presale\nJoin The ETFSwap Community\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions presented in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of CoinCheckup.

This grant will support ten rounds of Quadratic Funding within the Cosmos Hub ecosystem over the next two years.\n\nAs one of the largest treasury funding applications, this proposal sparked extensive discussions within the Cosmos community and received overwhelming support. Over $1 billion worth of ATOM, including major validators and core Cosmos contributors, voted in favor. The approval rate reached 91.9%, making Gov Proposal 917 the motion with the highest approval rating in the Cosmos Hub’s history.\nFollowing the approval of this proposal, Dora Factory, in collaboration with DoraHacks, has officially announced the second AEZ (ATOM Economic Zone) quadratic funding program, marking the launch of the first long-term funding initiative. This quadratic funding program will span two years, starting May 15, 2024, and ending May 2026.\nThe passing of Gov Proposal 917 brings native Quadratic Funding to the Cosmos Hub for the first time.\nWhat is Public Goods Funding?\nPublic goods funding is a frequently discussed concept within the Web3 industry. Generally, public goods refer to goods or services that are available for everyone to use.\nIn crypto, public goods can include blockchain infrastructure, storage, developer tools, software middleware, and user-facing applications such as block explorers, data dashboards, and wallets.\nDue to its inherent transparency and verifiability, crypto and blockchain are ideal tools for funding public goods.\nHowever, web3 public goods funding also faces numerous challenges.\nEnter Dora Factory, which strives to build infrastructure that enables large-scale adoption of public goods funding.\nDora Factory: Infrastructure Born for Public Goods\nDora Factory is a leading decentralised governance infrastructure and multi-chain public goods funding protocol stack, incubated and supported by DoraHacks, the industry’s developer and public goods funding platform. Its products include Public Good Staking infrastructure and Dora Vota, an appchain for voting and governance designed to empower the global Hacker Movement, open-source communities, and DAOs.\nMulti-Chain Quadratic Funding: Aligning Communities and Ecosystem Builders\nWhat is Quadratic Funding? Through native-token donations, token-holder communities can support high-quality early-stage projects and public goods within various ecosystems, fostering better collaboration among foundations, communities, and developers.\nAs the first and only team in the industry to develop and advocate for this approach, Dora Factory is a true leader in multi-chain quadratic funding. It has successfully deployed native quadratic funding in numerous mainstream crypto ecosystems, including BNB Chain, Solana, Polygon, Aptos, Cosmos Hub, Injective, and Avalanche.\nPublic Good Staking: Providing Sustainable Funding for Public Goods\nIn late 2022, Dora Factory introduced the concept of Public Good Staking. By operating underlying infrastructure such as validators, they earn native block rewards that are continuously used to fund multi-chain developers and public goods ecosystems.\nDora Factory has promoted public good staking in over 30 ecosystems’ mainnets and testnets, achieving a TVL (Total Value Locked) of over $400 million, providing up to $10 million in sustainable annual funding.\nIn the future, Dora Factory will explore ways to use cryptocurrency to fund cutting-edge technology fields like space technology, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and biomedical research.\nCommunity Incentive Fund: Making Public Goods Funding More Fun\nDora Factory launched the Community Incentive Fund to make the public goods funding process more engaging and fun. Top meme and NFT projects like Celestia’s Celestine Sloth Collection, Injective Ninja, Aptos Gui Inu, and Aptos Monkeys have become partners of the Community Incentive Fund. Through retroactive airdrops and gamified donations, these projects have brought more fun to public goods funding, receiving contributions and donations from nearly 100,000 unique addresses across different communities.\nAnonymous Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (aMACI): Bringing Privacy Technology to On-Chain Public Goods Governance\nMACI is a cryptographic technology designed to maximize the detection and elimination of collusion in voting. In 2022 and 2023, the Dora Factory team collaborated with ETHDenver, 0x, and OpenSea to introduce privacy voting to crypto hackathons. MACI has significantly improved privacy and reduced collusion in on-chain governance and voting.\nIn 2024, Dora Factory launched aMACI, adding voter anonymity to eliminate collusion between the vote initiator and the operator. This further enhances privacy and lowers the usage threshold of MACI voting. This is a significant step towards future large-scale decentralized voting systems.\nDora Vota: Open Infrastructure for Public Goods Funding\nDora Vota is a multi-chain governance and voting infrastructure. Vota and interoperability protocols like IBC will provide modular voting and governance infrastructure, such as plug-and-play quadratic funding modules and grant distribution mechanisms. As the first permissionless appchain focused on scaling on-chain voting, Dora Vota will offer developers a valuable playground, unlocking more possibilities for public goods funding and decentralized community governance.\nRecently, Dora Factory secured strategic financing from dao5, Whampoa Digital, and angel investors like EigenLayer co-founder Calvin Liu. This is the first strategic round of a new funding series since Dora Factory’s $17.5M raise in 2021.\nAs Dora’s Public Good Staking grows and Vota’s ecosystem matures, the team believes Dora Factory will continue exploring new solutions to traditional funding inefficiencies, accelerating the maturity of governance and public goods funding in the multi-chain ecosystem.\n\nCommunity contributor Chris Lee Dora Factory [email protected]\n","create_date":"2024-05-15T20:59:06+02:00","tag":"Press Release","author":""},

Protect your financial privacy against KYC risks with Tumbler.io's secure, cryptographic mixing solutions.","title":"Tumbler.io Review: A Streamlined Bitcoin Mixer - CoinCheckup","content":" The level of privacy that users have while transacting on-chain is often misunderstood, with many people believing that cryptocurrency is mostly anonymous. The reality is quite the opposite.\nBlockchains utilize a public ledger to store a full history of user transactions, meaning that every on-chain interaction from every user is stored on a database that can be accessed by anyone. While no one is able to alter this transaction data, the mechanism can cause privacy concerns for some users — especially when combined with KYC data from centralized service providers.\nCalls for greater on-chain privacy have led to a variety of solutions, with one emerging solution for Bitcoin being Tumbler.io. The platform offers a BTC mixing solution that obfuscates the transaction history of each cryptocurrency token, helping users to protect their privacy on-chain and avoid key security concerns.\nTumbler.io is a Bitcoin (BTC) mixer that unlocks a higher degree of privacy when compared with traditional blockchain use. The platform allows users to pool their funds together, which can obfuscate the flow of BTC on the blockchain and help users to keep their identities secure.\nOn-chain transactions leave an immutable digital footprint that, when combined with KYC credentials collected from third-party vendors such as CEXs, can be used to trace the flow of BTC back to individuals. This results in all transactions being made fully public, with anyone, anywhere in the world being able to view the contents of a person’s wallet, and that wallet being linked directly to an individual via government-issued identification.\nBy providing a solution that can mitigate these privacy issues, Tumbler.io offers a way to protect the identity of its users and, by extension, the security of their finances.\nTumbler.io users can send their cryptocurrency to a shared pool, where the tokens are inscribed with a unique cryptographic tag known as “Tumbler code”. The user will then receive an equal amount of crypto back in return, except the tokens they receive will come from the pool’s others users.\nThe unique tag applied by Tumbler.io is used to differentiate the user’s tokens from the rest of the crypto in the pool. This alters the flow of transaction data on the blockchain and makes it more difficult to trace the origins of each token.\nAdditionally, Tumbler.io maximizes privacy by deploying a time delay between transactions and by splitting each user’s total BTC into several parts for deposits. This makes it near-impossible to trace on-chain data back to a single participant, helping to preserve financial privacy and help users to retain their anonymity on-chain.\nTo understand why someone might want to use an on-chain privacy solution, it’s important to first understand exactly what blockchains are and how they work.\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is a cryptographically secure online ledger that can process user transactions without intermediaries. To do this, transaction data is recorded permanently on a public database that is unable to be altered retroactively by any single party.\nRecording user data permanently on the blockchain can cause security concerns, because it requires that public keys are permanently linked to a full history of a user’s transactions.\nWhile public keys are not individually identifiable by default, the combination of public blockchain data with identification documents collected by centralized blockchain companies can link public keys to their owner. In essence, on-chain transactions can be traced back to individuals once a public key has interacted with KYC-enabled accounts.\nMany blockchain users believe that people have a right to financial privacy, which has led to demand for solutions such as Tumbler.io across various blockchain ecosystems. Regarding the Bitcoin blockchain specifically, Tumbler.io utilizes one of the most prominent methods for achieving a greater level of privacy — Bitcoin mixing.\nTumbler.io charges a service fee that varies according to the total BTC being mixed by the pool’s participants. The more BTC sent to the pool, the higher the discount for the end user.\nIn total, fees range between 0.50% and 0.90% of the total BTC sent. A full breakdown of the service charges can be found in the table below.\nThe legal status of Bitcoin mixing depends on the local jurisdiction of the end user. In most places, Bitcoin mixing is considered legal as long as criminal funds are not involved.\nThere are, however, concerns among regulators in certain jurisdictions regarding the legal status of Bitcoin mixing. Some law enforcement agencies have highlighted that mixing services can enable money laundering by allowing people to obscure proceeds from criminal activities, which means that the legal status of the process is still evolving.\nSince people can use Bitcoin mixers for legitimate privacy reasons, it can be difficult for regulators to classify the mechanism as illegal. The legality often depends on licensing and intent, but in most cases, courts will consider use on a case-by-case basis.\nIt’s important to find out whether Bitcoin mixing is legal in your current location before using Tumbler.io. In the United States, for example, all Bitcoin mixers are required to register under the Bank Secrecy Act. Meanwhile, the National Crime Agency (NCA) in the UK has called for direct regulation of Bitcoin mixing, as reported by Coindesk.\nSince regulations are constantly evolving, make sure to do your due diligence before making use of a privacy solution such as Tumbler.io. Bitcoin mixing is not explicitly illegal in most jurisdictions around the world, but there may be risks for users in several places.\nTumbler.io delivers a safe and effective Bitcoin mixing solution. The platform enables its users to achieve a greater level of privacy while transacting on-chain, helping to store currency and mask their transactions without bringing attention to their total holdings on the public ledger.\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin said about a similar solution to Tumbler.io, that “privacy is normal”. While it’s certainly the case that Bitcoin mixing solutions have received attention from lawmakers owing to their potential for illicit use, Tumbler.io ensures full compliance for users in most jurisdictions around the world.\nYou can learn more about Tumbler.io here.\n","create_date":"2024-04-30T12:40:03+02:00","tag":"Bitcoin Mixer","author":""},

A two-day conference called NiceHashX with the theme “Bitcoin Conference on the Sunny Side of the Alps” is scheduled for November 8 and 9, 2024, to commemorate the startup’s ten years in business. NiceHash was founded in 2014 by two students from Slovenia.\nCommenting on this anticipated conference, CEO of NiceHash, Vladimir Hozjan, said “We are delighted to welcome the world to discover how Slovenia is leading the way in European Bitcoin adoption,” He added, “With 10 years of experience in this industry, we have witnessed phenomenal growth in the interest of using Bitcoin, here in Maribor and around the country. Join us as we celebrate, and witness Bitcoin in its purest form, used by everyday people, alongside some of the brightest speakers in the industry.”\nThough frequently disregarded in favor of cryptocurrency hotspots like Switzerland, Slovenia has quickly become a leader in using blockchain and Bitcoin. Over 1,000 establishments in the country, such as cafes, hotels, restaurants, and even large grocery chains, are all currently accepting Bitcoin as a mean of payment.\nThe goal of NiceHashX is to draw the world’s attention to Slovenia’s developing Bitcoin community and establish Maribor as a center of innovation for the European cryptocurrency industry. A number of Maribor-based businesses that are making use of blockchain technology will be highlighted; in fact, one of the conference’s sections will be devoted to exhibiting these businesses.\nAside from drawing the attention of the world to Slovenia, the anticipated conference has also drawn the attention of popular speakers from the Bitcoin industry. Notable figures comprise Saifedean Ammous, the author of the well-known book “The Bitcoin Standard,” Joe Hall, previously a reporter with CoinTelegraph; Martin Kuchař, the founder of the BTC Prague conference, Pierre Corbin, the co-founder of Bitcoin FilmFest, Jameson Lopp, the CTO of CASA, and many more.\nThe conference agenda includes subjects covering legislation challenges amidst the growth of crypto exchanges, changes in the mining and energy industry, and the regulation and acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender in Europe.\nThe guests at the conference will be entertained with exhibitions, side events, an official after-party, and a VIP dinner.\nNiceHash is soft-launching a new Bitcoin payment method integrated with local Maribor merchants in the run-up to the conference. This innovation will enable guests to engage in real-world Bitcoin payments with practical demonstrations.\nMaribor’s 2012 nomination as the European Capital of Culture makes it a perfect place for a crypto conference. Located in the Pohorje Mountain foothills, the city is a popular ski resort area because of its stunning architecture, vineyards, and laid-back atmosphere.\nWith Nicehash celebrating its tenth anniversary since its launch in 2014 and acceptance of Bitcoin expanding throughout Europe, NiceHashX offers a rare chance to get up close and personal with the emerging Bitcoin ecosystem.\n","create_date":"2024-05-14T14:00:00+02:00","tag":"Bitcoin Mining","author":""},

Some exchanges are geared toward supporting as many different digital assets as possible, while others focus on the sheer number of available features and trading tools.\nFounded in 2011, BTCC is the longest-running cryptocurrency trading platform, specializing in providing a top-tier cryptocurrency futures trading experience. In this article, we are going to highlight some of the main benefits of using BTCC and showcase how to move your crypto from KuCoin to BTCC.\nAs mentioned in the brief introduction, BTCC is a crypto futures contract trading platform, enabling users to turn a profit by correctly predicting future price movements of digital assets. Depending on their needs, BTCC traders can use futures contracts with no expiration date (Daily, Weekly, Quarterly) and no expiration date (Perpetual)\nThe highest level of leverage BTCC users can set when trading daily futures is 150x. The exchange allows investors to predict future price movements of a wide range of different crypto assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and many others.\nHere are the main advantages of using the BTCC cryptocurrency exchange:\nRegistering an account on BTCC is very simple and takes a very short amount of time. After opening an account, users can, but are not required to supply their personal information. If you wish to register a BTCC account, please proceed by following the link below.\nIt is worth mentioning that new BTCC users can take advantage of an exclusive promotion that awards newcomers with up to $3,500 worth of USDT rewards. New users who deposit funds on the platform within 7 days of opening an account are eligible for the promotion.\nIf you’ve never moved your funds between exchanges, there’s no reason to be nervous. The whole process is very simple and takes only a few minutes at most. Follow our step-by-step guide below to see how to transfer your cryptocurrency from KuCoin to BTCC. Keep in mind that the guide showcases the process using BTCC and KuCoin mobile apps. The process is almost identical when using desktop clients.\nLog in to your BTCC account and click on the “Deposit” button nested in the “Assets” menu.\nContinue by choosing your desired deposit currency. For the purposes of this guide, we will be using Tether (USDT), specifically the ERC-20 variant. Keep in mind that selecting the same blockchain network on the deposit and withdrawal platform is paramount. Selecting a different blockchain network can result in a permanent loss of funds.\nClick on the “Copy Address” button to store the blockchain address in the clipboard. If you’ve selected a cryptocurrency that requires additional information to facilitate a transfer, like XRP and its destination tag, copy that information as well.\nLog in to your KuCoin account and withdraw the digital asset you wish to move to the BTCC crypto exchange. We will show you how to do it in steps 5 through 9.\nSelect “Assets” from the menu at the bottom of the screen. Continue by selecting the “Main” tab at the top of the screen and then click on “Withdraw”. At this point, it is worth mentioning that KuCoin will ask you to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) and a transaction PIN if this is your first time withdrawing cryptocurrency with KuCoin.\nSearch for the crypto you would like to send to BTCC in the search field located at the top of the screen. In our example, we’ll be using USDT. After locating the digital asset, click on it.\nYou will be greeted with a “Withdraw Crypto” menu. From here, you can select the parameters of your transaction. First, we will be selecting the blockchain network USDT will be sent on. Click on the “Network” menu (highlighted in red in the image below).\nSelect the “Ethereum (ERC-20)” option from the menu. As a reminder, you should always use the same network that was selected when copying the address on BTCC (see Step 2).\nPaste the blockchain address you’ve copied from BTCC and enter the amount of funds you would like to transfer. After setting all parameters of your transfer, click on “Withdraw”. If this is your first time transferring money between blockchain addresses, you might want to send a smaller amount first, to make sure that everything is working as intended.\nHead back to the Assets menu in the BTCC app to see whether the funds withdrawn from KuCoin have arrived. Click on the USDT option to open “Transaction Details” to view detailed information about recent transfers. Keep in mind that the speed of transactions can vary depending on the level of network congestion, so you might have to wait a couple of minutes before funds are deposited in your BTCC account.\nBy funding your BTCC account, you can tap into a rich cryptocurrency derivatives trading offering with more than a decade-long track record. Hopefully, this article helped you transfer cryptocurrency from KuCoin to BTCC.\nIf you are interested, you can take a look at other similar guides, showing how to transfer crypto to BTCC from Binance US, FTX US, Kraken, and Coinbase:\n","create_date":"2022-08-24T15:38:06+02:00","tag":"BTCC","author":""}
