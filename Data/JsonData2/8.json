While some analysts predict a significant price jump this weekend, others remain cautious due to the coin’s recent struggles and the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC.\nXRP has been stuck in low gear, failing to break past the $0.54 resistance level for weeks. This sluggishness extends to the broader timeframes, with the coin experiencing a decline in the past month, week, and even the last 24 hours.\nAt the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5185, down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, but managed a measly 0.4% uptick in the last week, data from Coingecko shows.\nCoincodex, a prominent crypto prediction platform, stands out from the crowd with a bullish forecast. They predict a substantial price increase for XRP, with the coin potentially reaching $0.648 by Tuesday, May 21st. This would represent a jump of over 32% from its current price.\nHowever, even Coincodex acknowledges the potential for a different scenario. The report mentions the possibility of consolidation around $0.4952 or even a price drop if profit-taking intensifies.\nMany experts believe the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC is a significant factor behind XRP’s underperformance. The SEC alleges that XRP is a security, while Ripple argues it’s a currency. This legal battle has cast a shadow over the cryptocurrency, leading to investor hesitation.\nThere is a glimmer of hope, however. The article reports that the lawsuit is nearing its conclusion, with a final judgment expected from Judge Analisa Torres this year. A definitive resolution, especially if it favors Ripple, could pave the way for a significant price increase in the future. Some analysts, as the report mentions, even predict XRP could surge to $47 during the next bull run.\nThe future of XRP remains uncertain. Coincodex’s prediction offers a ray of optimism for a near-term price jump. However, the recent price slump, ongoing legal battle, and cautious investor sentiment paint a more complex picture.\nThe resolution of the SEC lawsuit could be a turning point for XRP. If Ripple prevails, it could remove a major obstacle to wider adoption and institutional investment. This, combined with a potential bull run in the broader cryptocurrency market, could propel XRP to new heights.\nHowever, even a favorable outcome wouldn’t guarantee smooth sailing. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and XRP faces competition from other established players.\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

{"url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/crypto-analyst-xrp-price-explosion-over-18/","web_url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/","type":"article","description":"Crypto analyst Dark Defender makes a compelling case for a potential significant rise in the price of XRP.","title":"Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Explosion To Over $18","content":" In a recent analysis provided by the crypto analyst Dark Defender, a compelling case has been made for the potential significant rise in the price of XRP. Through a detailed examination of the XRP/USD chart on a monthly time frame, as sourced from Binance, Dark Defender highlights a large bullish formation, which he describes as a “bull flag” across multiple longer-term time frames including monthly, three-month, and six-month charts.\nThe analysis shows a substantial initial upsurge in price marked by a green arrow, suggesting a strong bullish momentum that started around early 2017 and peaked later that year. The price action following this peak is what Dark Defender identifies as a bull flag pattern. This pattern is characterized by a period of consolidation following a sharp movement in price, resembling a flag on a pole.\nThe consolidation, traced with a red descending trend line and a blue ascending trend line, forms a converging pattern known as a triangle, which typically suggests that the period of consolidation is nearing an end as the lines converge. According to Dark Defender, this suggests a breakout is imminent.\n“I have read some posts that XRP had a bull flag in the daily time frame, etc. If those are correction bull flags, this is a bull flag, too. But a bullish one. It is in the monthly, three-month, and six-month time frames. If you know a bull flag, you can enjoy your coffee today. Cheers,” he stated.\nIn his forecast, Dark Defender uses the flag pole and Fibonacci extension levels to predict future price points. After the expected breakout above the red resistance line, the first target is situated at the 161.80% Fibonacci level, which would bring XRP to approximately $1.88. A further ambitious target is set at the 261.80% Fibonacci level, priced at about $5.86.\nThe most optimistic target lies at the 361.80% Fibonacci level, forecasting the price to soar as high as approximately $18.23. Notably, Dark Defender’s blue line, analogous in length to the flagpole, shows that the XRP price could rise well above $18.\nThis analysis was further commented on by another renowned XRP community analyst, EGRAG CRYPTO, who brought attention to the fact that the flag portion of the pattern extends beyond half the length of the initial pole, a structural detail that might typically invalidate the bull flag designation.\n“I’ve dabbled in this analysis before, but lately, I’ve become increasingly intrigued by the potential of a symmetrical triangle breakout. What caught my eye is that the Flag is extending beyond half the length of the Pole which invalidates the structure. Regardless of who’s right or wrong, hope to meet in the near future and being multimillionaires. Keep up the fantastic work,” Egrag noted.\nDespite this technical caveat, EGRAG CRYPTO remains positive about the potential of a symmetrical triangle breakout. In a recent analysis of the weekly chart, EGRAG elaborated that XRP will at least explode towards $1.5 if price breaks out to the upside of the triangle. On a broader triangle pattern, EGRAG expects a move to $5.89.\n“XRP Army, STAY STEADY! There’s a mini pump to $1.5 and a major pump to $5.89 in the cards, with the MACRO pump potentially soaring above 2 digits,” he stated. Despite their different approaches, the two analysts are therefore very close in their analyses.\nAt press time, XRP traded at $0.5189.\nJake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

ALGT, TAO, and FET Emerge as Top Picks | NewsBTC","content":" Since the last decade, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in many industries has been on the rise. In fact, the integration of AI is marked as a sign of advancement and readiness for the current/future market landscape. Cryptocurrency projects have not been left behind, as many have creatively and innovatively found the blend of blockchain and AI to create a unique solution.\nThe end of 2023 and into 2024 saw a sharp rise in the value of AI crypto, but they were soon quiet again. What could have happened? Can they make a comeback and top headlines? Why did ALGT, TAO, and FET emerge as top picks? Let’s find out more.\n\nAI and blockchain are coming together and hold tremendous promise for the advancement and optimization of many solutions. Blockchain’s secure and immutable nature provides a firm foundation for AI solutions to be developed and deployed. On the other hand, AI can enhance many blockchain processes, optimizing security, scalability, and decentralization. This mutually beneficial relationship gives AI cryptocurrencies an edge and positions them in front of technological innovation.\nThere are three major pointers to this position. The first is the rising rate of AI adoption. There is hardly any mainstream industry that is not making one or two moves with AI, and mainstream interest in AI means there is more demand for AI-powered solutions that could benefit AI crypto projects.\nThe second will be the flexible regulatory landscape. Just like with cryptocurrencies, regulatory bodies are starting to see AI’s potential and are developing frameworks to ensure safety and guide development. This regulatory stamp could increase trust and stability for AI crypto projects.\nLastly, AI technology is breaking new ground rapidly. This technological advancement can be a strong leverage for AI cryptos to offer more precise and efficient solutions to real-world problems.\nTo learn more about Algotech, visit the Algotech presale website or join the Algotech community.\nAI cryptocurrencies like Algotech (ALGT), Bittensor (TAO), and Fetch.ai (FET) are highlighted to make a comeback. They leverage AI and blockchain for innovative solutions: ALGT for algorithmic trading, TAO for decentralized machine learning, and FET for accessible AI tech. Rising AI adoption, favorable regulations, and rapid advancements position these projects as top investment picks.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

According to Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, this anti-crypto stance may very well cost US President Joe Biden another term in office.\nIn a scathing rebuke, Hoskinson accused the administration of harboring a “systematic effort to hurt the crypto industry,” citing numerous policy meetings, private dinners, and open letters where the community has tried in vain to foster understanding. Despite these attempts at engagement, he argues, regulators remain steadfast in their campaign against the sector.\n“53 million Americans, regardless of their politics and preferences, are being painted as soft criminals,” Hoskinson laments, warning that this hostile environment has already landed some of his industry peers, including Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao, in jail.\nHoskinson has singled out Sen. Elizabeth Warren as the driving force behind the administration’s anti-crypto agenda, going so far as to suggest a clandestine pact between her and Biden.\nThe Cardano founder claims that Warren, known for her staunch opposition to digital assets, was able to extend her influence into the Treasury Department, handpicking like-minded individuals who share her distaste for the industry.\nThis perceived alliance, Hoskinson argues, has resulted in an administration that is heavily tilted against crypto, effectively labeling a significant portion of the population as “criminals.” He views this as a devastating blow, not just for the industry but for the democratic process as a whole.\nAmidst his frustrations, Hoskinson offers a tantalizing prediction: the crypto industry will be the “kingmaker” in future US elections. He asserts that the current administration’s anti-crypto stance is predicated on the belief that there will be no political consequences to its actions. However, Hoskinson is convinced that the voting public will prove them wrong.\nHoskinson declares, underscoring the pivotal role that the crypto industry could play in shaping the political landscape:\nThe Cardano founder envisions a future where the next generation of Congress members, senators, and presidents are “crypto natives,” paving the way for a more inclusive and progressive regulatory environment. He believes that the industry’s exponential growth and increasing influence will make it a force to be reckoned with in the political arena.\nThe escalating tensions between the Biden administration and the crypto industry have had a direct impact on the broader digital asset market. Investor confidence has been shaken, leading to significant volatility and price fluctuations across major cryptocurrencies.\nIn the wake of the crackdown and the heightened political rhetoric, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen sharp declines, with prices dropping by over 20% in the past month alone.\nSmaller altcoins have fared even worse, as the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory landscape has prompted many investors to steer clear of riskier assets.\nIndustry experts warn that this turbulence may continue until a clearer path forward emerges, either through a change in political leadership or a softening of the administration’s stance on crypto.\nFeatured image from Sky News, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

His insights provide a deep dive into the underlying factors that could temper the market’s performance.\nPentoshi began his analysis by stating, “This cycle should have the largest diminishing returns of any cycle,” attributing this prediction to several key market conditions. Primarily, he noted that the base market capitalization for cryptocurrencies has increased significantly in each successive cycle, setting a higher starting point that makes further exponential growth increasingly challenging.\n“Each cycle has set a floor about 10x the previous lows in terms of market cap,” Pentoshi explained. He provided a historical context, recounting that when he entered the crypto market in 2017, the market cap for altcoins was only around $12-15 billion, a figure that ballooned to over $1 trillion during peak periods. He argued, “That growth isn’t repeatable,” pointing out that the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which was then nascent, played a significant role in driving previous cycles’ exceptional returns.\nAnother significant factor Pentoshi highlighted is the dramatic increase in the number of altcoins and the corresponding market dilution. “Today, however, there are a lot more alts, and a lot more dilution,” he remarked, indicating that the proliferation of new tokens spreads investment thinner across the market, reducing the potential for individual tokens to achieve substantial price increases.\nPentoshi also touched upon the demographic shifts in crypto ownership. He contrasted the early days of crypto adoption, when approximately 2% of Americans were involved in the market, to the present, where over 25% of Americans have some form of crypto investment. “It just requires more capital to move the markets, and there will continue to be a lot more alts, spreading it out further,” he noted, emphasizing the logistical and financial challenges of replicating past growth rates in a much more saturated market.\nAn often-overlooked aspect of market dynamics, according to Pentoshi, is the role of token liquidity and its impact on price stability. He detailed that recently, tokens amounting to about $250 million were unlocked daily, though not necessarily sold. “Assuming they all got sold, that is the inflows you’d need just to keep prices stable for 24 hours,” he explained, highlighting the delicate balance required to maintain current market levels, let alone drive prices upward.\nLooking forward, Pentoshi was conservative in his expectations for the Total3 index, which tracks the top 125 altcoins (excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum). He estimated, “My best guess is that this cycle we don’t see Total 3 go 2x past the 21′ cycle ATH. So 2.2T max for Total3.” This projection underscores his broader thesis that while the market continues to offer daily opportunities, the era of “easy, outsized gains” might be behind us.\nPentoshi concluded his analysis with advice for investors, suggesting a more cautious approach to market participation. “If you believe the cycle is 50% over, you should be taking out more than you are putting in and building up some cash and buying other assets with lower risk in the meantime,” he advised, stressing the importance of securing gains and diversifying holdings to mitigate risk.\nReflecting on the psychological aspects of investing, he added, “Most people never really learn. Because if you can’t control your greed, and defeat it, you are destined to give back your gains repeatedly.” His parting words were a reminder of the cyclical and often predatory nature of financial markets, urging investors to secure profits and protect themselves from foreseeable downturns.\nAt press time, TOTAL3 stood at $635.565 billion, which is still more than -43 % below the last cycle high.\nJake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Kevin Capital, a cryptocurrency market expert and enthusiast has offered insights on DOGE’s price action, confirming an effective break out for the crypto asset, as it surpasses the $0.153 resistance level.\nIt is noteworthy that the crypto analyst Kevin previously predicted that for Dogecoin to move higher it needs to break above the $0.153 level and the 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 4-hour timeframe. “When it comes to Dogecoin all DOGE needs to do to have a higher chance of playing out the potential inverse head and shoulders is a break above the 4-hour 200 SMA and the $0.153 level,” he stated.\nAt the time, Kevin noted that DOGE has repeatedly tried to reach this moving average and has been turned down. Thus, should the crypto asset break out of and maintain this moving average, he expects an upswing to the $0.22 price level.\nAccording to the analyst, the development has successfully manifested today, as the digital asset has surpassed the $0.153 level and the 200 moving average. Given Kevin’s prognosis, Dogecoin will have to sustain this area to see a further upsurge.\nIf DOGE manages to hold during any prospective backtest and thereafter, Kevin has placed his inverted head and shoulders target at $0.18 and $0.22, if it is within reach.\nThe post read:\nUpdate on the Dogecoin chart. We have officially broken above the $0.153 level and the 200 SMA on the 4HR. We need to hold this area on any potential backtest and then .18 cents and the inverse head and shoulders target of $0.22 cents if right in reach.\nThis accomplishment coincides with a spike in the meme coin market’s favorable sentiment, which indicates increased investor trust and interest in these digital assets. With breakouts and decouplings occurring all over the place over the past few days, meme coins had an eye-catching start to the week.\nDogecoin’s recent price upswing has triggered an optimistic outlook from multiple crypto experts. Another analyst who has shared a positive prediction for the meme coin is Crypto Daily Trade Signals.\nCrypto Daily Trade Signals has delved into the current support levels for DOGE and the potential price trajectory following a breakout. According to the channel, the 50-day EMA at $0.1652 is serving as a resistance level at the moment. Should DOGE break past this barrier, it could trigger the start of a bull run for the coin.\nFurthermore, the channel noted that the 100-day EMA around $0.1434 is presently offering support, indicating that DOGE has a cushion against additional drops. Meanwhile, the 200-day EMA is acting as a strong long-term support level at $0.1237.\nDuring the time of writing, Dogecoin was demonstrating an upward momentum of over 6% in the past week, trading at $0.1549. Its trading volume and market cap have both increased by over 11% and 3% respectively in the past day.\nMy name is Godspower Owie and i am an employee for Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlet.

In a new X post on Saturday, the veteran analyst takes a deeper dive explaining the reasons behind his advocacy for altcoins investment ahead of a highly expected crypto bull run.\nIn his most recent bullish prediction on altcoins, van de Poppe begins by stating these tokens may not present as the most ideal investment especially considering that their combined value is down by 70% against Bitcoin in the last three months.\nThe analyst has attributed this poor performance to several factors including a delay in network updates and an extended bear market. In addition, van de Poppe also notes Ethereum’s current struggles to be a significant contributor to this market downturn.\nHe explains that typically the crypto bullish hype moves from Bitcoin to Ethereum, followed by tokens with big market cap, then middle-cap tokens and small-cap tokens.\nHowever, this cycle appears to be experiencing some delay due to a bearish cloud over Ethereum, driven by uncertainty over the approval of a proposed spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) as well as its asset class.\nNevertheless, van de Poppe believes this delay to be quite temporary as he postulates that market traders are currently pricing in any potential negative effect from the denial of an Ethereum Spot ETF or the classification of the prominent altcoin as a security.\nOnce Ethereum embarks on a bullish course, van de Poppe predicts other altcoins to follow suit. The analyst projects that certain tokens could record a 1000% gain as seen between October 2023-February 2024, amid the hype around Bitcoin spot ETFs.\nHowever, the analyst nudges investors to buy into the altcoin market now during the period of “lowest confidence”. He believes such an act is similar to investing in Bitcoin at $3,700 at the start of 2020, thus ensuring investors generate maximum profits in the coming bull run.\nAs weeks continue to progress, the approval of an Ethereum spot ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears highly uncertain.\nThis sentiment is driven by the Commission’s ongoing deliberation on whether to classify Ethereum as a security as well as a lack of dialogue between the agency and prospective issuers. The next deadline dates are for May 23/May 24, during which the SEC will respond to 2 ETF applications with many analysts expecting further delays from the Commission.\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum trades at around $3,123.39 reflecting a 0.53% increase in the last day.\nSemilore Faleti is a cryptocurrency writer specialized in the field of journalism and content creation.

The strong correction caused Bitcoin and the altcoins market to drop to levels not seen since February.\nWhile some sectors of the crypto community felt like the bull run was over or needed to “cool-off”, others seemed optimistic about the cycle’s future. Now that the market is back from the correction, analysts foresee that the altcoin season might come soon.\nOver the weekend, crypto analyst and trader MilkybullCrypto shared with his X followers that the Altcoins market capitalization was at “an RSI level that initiates an explosive rally.”\nPer his chart, this level is a “reset for a healthy rally,” as seen in 2016 and 2020. During these two cycles, when the altcoins reached this level, a “huge rally” followed.\nThe analyst shared his latest forecast on Monday after seeing the market strengthen its recovery. To Milkybull, the altcoins market cap finished a “Heatly retest.”\nThe market displayed a similar correction during the 2020-2021 rally before skyrocketing to all-time high (ATH) levels. The chart seems to display the same performance, which could mean that altcoins are “in preparation for an explosive rally,” if history repeats itself.\n\nSimilarly, crypto trader and analyst Captain Fabik considers the “Healthy Correction is done.” In his X post, the analyst identified a bullish falling wedge pattern, which signals a “bullish rally incoming.”\nAccording to analyst and trader Rekt Capital, the Altcoin market cap, excluding the top 10 cryptocurrencies, has “successfully retested the $250 billion level as a support level” over the last several weeks.\nPer the trader, the altcoins are following the proposed path of his “Ultimate Altcoin Market Cap Game Plan For The Coming Months.” On this plan, Rekt Capital forecasted altcoins market cap would surge to the $315 billion level before retracing back to the $250 billion mark. This retrace would be followed by an explosive surge above the $440 billion market capitalization.\nAltcoins have stayed above the $250 billion support zone despite the strong corrections, as seen in the chart below. To the analyst, this suggests the market is “now showing initial signs of trying to curl up from here.”\n\nRenowned figures have expressed their “disappointment” in altcoins’ performance this cycle. Altcoin Sherpa considers that “many alts didn’t even run that hard over the last few months,” which could suggest that it’s time for a “cool-off.” At the time, the analyst deemed altcoins’ rally was “done” for the next 1-4 months.\nHowever, others believe the “euphoria phase” for altcoins is coming. According to Crypto Yhodda, “The alts will rise again, and by the end of 2024, they will go crazy.” Moreover, the analyst believes that “Altcoins Cycle III” will give us some crazy pumps.\nAccording to his chart, the altcoins’ cycle I and II displayed a symmetrical triangle pattern before the breakout. The surge was followed by a slowdown before the upward trajectory continued, called “Round 1” by the analyst.\nSubsequently, the rally would repeat the pattern on a second round before reaching the cycle’s top. “Cycle III” appears to be in the middle of Round 1, which suggests to the analyst there is a long road ahead before it “hits the euphoria phase.”\n\nRubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies –or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages – currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.\nDisclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

{"url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-volume-open-interest/","web_url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/","type":"article","description":"A number of Dogecoin metrics have turned bullish in the last few days, showing increased interest from investors.","title":"Dogecoin Derivatives Volume Jumps 111% As Open Interest Spikes, But What About Price?","content":" A number of Dogecoin metrics have turned bullish in the last few days, showing increased interest from investors. This ranges from the meme coin’s daily derivatives trading volumes to its open interest seeing a significant increase. However, in the midst of this, the Dogecoin price has remained limp, sparking worries among investors.\nOne of the major Dogecoin metrics that has seen a significant increase recently is its derivatives trading volume. The trend began on Monday when the derivatives trading volume saw a 60% uptick. However, it seems DOGE traders are far from done as the volume has almost doubled since that time.\nAccording to data from Coinglass, the Dogecoin derivatives trading volume is up 111% in the last day alone. This has pushed the derivatives trading volume to $3.85 billion, a significant increase from the $1.99 billion that was recorded on Monday.\nThe launch of Dogecoin futures contracts by Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange in the United States, may have something to do with this. Following the launch on April 1, 2024, the meme coin has seen increased interest in its derivatives products, which explains the increase in the volume.\nHowever, the derivatives trading volume is not the only thing that has seen an uptick during this time. As Coinglass data shows, the Dogecoin open interest has also risen significantly during this time. It has seen an approximately 12% increase in the last day to touch above $830 million.\nDespite this increase in the Dogecoin open interest, it is still a long way from its all-time high of $1.91 billion that was recorded on March 29. So, the current open interest of $830 million represents an over 50% decline from its all-time high. At the same time, the DOGE price is still struggling, showing a disconnect between the rise in metrics and the price of the meme coin.\nThe Dogecoin price has remained muted during this time, even with the increased momentum. The total daily trading volume of the meme coin is up 128% in the last day. However, its price has barely moved 4%, even amid the meme coin craze sparked by the GameStop (GME) 100% rally.\nDOGEs price has barely moved during this time and the resistance at $0.15 is waxing stronger. This suggests that the focus is no longer on Dogecoin during meme coin craze and rather on newer counterparts such as Solana-based GME and AMC, which have seen incredible rallies in the last day.\nAt the time of writing, the DOGE price is trending at $0.49, with a 3.48% increase in the last day. However, in the longer time frame, the meme coin is struggling with 5.79% and 4% losses on the weekly and monthly charts, respectively.\nScott Matherson is a prominent crypto writer at NewsBTC with a knack for capturing the pulse of the market, covering pivotal shifts, technological advancements, and regulatory changes with precision.

His selection includes a mix of well-established and emerging digital currencies.\nHe stated, “If you had to pick only 10 tokens to own for the next 12 months (as a trade) what are they? Here’s mine: BTC, XRP, ETH, QNT, RNDR, SOL, KAS, AVAX, HBAR, CSPR. What am I missing?”\nBitcoin (BTC): Deaton likely selected Bitcoin due to the potential imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts anticipate that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETF by January 10, 2024, a move that could significantly impact Bitcoin’s value\nXRP: Deaton’s choice of XRP is consistent with his role as a strong supporter and legal advocate for the XRP community. XRP’s status as a regulatory-defined token in the United States with high utility adds to its appeal. Currently, XRP is consolidating after being rejected at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.7492.\nEthereum (ETH): Despite the harsh criticism of Ethereum’s founder, Deaton has included ETH in his list. This might be due to its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Also, BlackRock and several other financial giants have recently applied for a Spot Ethereum ETF, adding to the potential bullish trajectory of ETH in the next 12 months.\nQuant (QNT): The QNT token of Quant Network has found itself in a downtrend channel since late January this year, down approximately 35% from its year-to-date high. With the current price of $98.74, QNT is 78% below its all-time high of $428.38 on November 21, 2023. Nevertheless, Quant can boast partnerships with major financial institutions, including the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Bank of England, Bank of Canada, MasterCard, Amazon, and Barclays, to develop and test use cases for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\nRender Network (RNDR): The RDNR token is currently up 725% since the beginning of the year. Render Network provides a decentralized GPU rendering platform, allowing artists to scale GPU rendering work on-demand to high-performance GPU nodes. Notably, the RDNR price has also profited from the AI narrative.\nSolana: SOL has been one of the other big winners this year, up nearly 600% at the current price since it went below $8 at the end of last year. Solana is currently seen as the potential biggest challenger to Ethereum as a layer-1 blockchain, which is why Deaton may have ranked SOL on his list.\nKaspa (KAS): Kaspa has gained attention due to its positioning as a highly scalable Layer-1 blockchain, with a focus on fast confirmations and high throughput. Its underlying technology, GhostDAG/PHANTOM protocol, aims to balance security, scalability, and decentralization. The KAS token’s impressive performance, with an over 2,600 % increase year-to-date, makes it a notable inclusion.\nAvalanche (AVAX): Avalanche’s AVAX token might be included due to its recent gains of almost 130% since mid-October. Deaton may have chosen AVAX because of Avalanche’s involvement in the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s tokenization initiative, Project Guardian, as well as its partnership with Amazon Web Services and Deloitte, all of which are potential catalysts for price appreciation.\nHedera (HBAR): Hedera Hashgraph has gained prominence by becoming part of FedNow, the US Federal Reserve’s instant payments platform. This development led to a significant surge in the price of Hedera’s HBAR token.\nCasper (CSPR): Casper’s inclusion may be due to its position as one of the fastest-growing blockchain projects, with a focus on solving the blockchain trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization.\nRemarkably, Deaton’s selections reflect a balance between established market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and emerging, high-potential projects like Kaspa and Casper. This blend indicates a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investment, recognizing both stability and innovation within the digital asset space.\nJake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

{"url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/all/why-blackrock-could-bet-on-this-rwa-token-crypto/","web_url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/","type":"article","description":"In an era where the boundaries between traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto continue to blur, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) stands out","title":"Why BlackRock Could Bet On This RWA Token: Crypto Analyst","content":" In an era where the boundaries between traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto continue to blur, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) stands out as one of the hottest trends. This trend, which allows tangible assets like vehicles and real estate to be bought and sold as tokens on a blockchain, promises to revolutionize the efficiency and speed of asset transactions.\nJust last week, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has positioned itself at the forefront of this movement with the launch of a $100 million tokenization fund, which has already attracted over $240 million in investment within its first week.\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has been vocal about the potential of tokenization, stating that RWAs “could revolutionize, again, finance.” This comment has contributed to a notable surge in the valuation of several RWA crypto tokens in recent weeks. In light of these developments, crypto analysts from Layergg have identified a specific crypto project that they believe could garner significant interest from BlackRock.\nThe project in question is Aptos, which has been earmarked for its potential in the RWA space. According to Layergg’s analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), the narrative surrounding RWA and tokenization, bolstered by BlackRock’s involvement, suggests a nascent yet rapidly growing interest in this sector.\nThey highlight that mid to low cap RWA projects listed on Binance have performed exceptionally well, indicating a broader market interest spurred by narrative-driven investment strategies. However, the favorite crypto project for BlackRock could be Aptos.\nA closer look at Aptos reveals several factors that might make it an attractive partner for BlackRock. Firstly, Aptos is poised to make a significant announcement related to RWA in April, coinciding with the Aptos DeFi DAYS event from April 2 to 5.\nThis announcement is speculated to involve a partnership with a global asset management firm, potentially BlackRock. “A partnership with a global asset management firm is expected to be announced. It is speculated that this may include BlackRock,” the analysts remarked.\nThe basis for this speculation includes Aptos CEO Mo Shaikh’s previous tenure at BlackRock, suggesting pre-existing industry connections that could facilitate such a partnership.\nMoreover, Aptos founder Mo Shaikh & head of ecosystem at Aptos Labs Neil H hinted at this early on. In mid-February Shaikh revealed via X: “I sat down with three of the world’s largest asset managers this week A little preview…while the year started with ETFs, it will conclude with RWA on-chain en masse, growth in Asia and all using parallelisation on Aptos See you in Hong Kong.”\nOn February 21, Shaikh also commented on a post on X by Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner at Pantera Capital. Morehead stated, “Tomorrow I’ll be speaking at BlackRock’s Institutional Digital Assets Summit. […] The existence of that Summit **IS** the massive change. Really excited about this.” Mo Shaikh mysteriously commented, “There’s Summit to this.”\nBesides that, Adam Cader, founder of Thala Labs recently stated via X that “something is cooking for Aptos. I’m a co-founder of the largest application on the network, and here’s my list of upcoming significant ecosystem wide catalysts.” Cader referenced Shaikh’s statement and added that Blackrock, Vanguard, and Fidelity are the three largest asset managers in the world.\n“If I had to guess this refers to either them using the chain in some way / integrating it into one of their products which has precedent in the TradFi world. Also note Blackrock is the most crypto-aligned of the bunch,” he said via X.\nBut that’s not all. Aptos has been hinted to explore partnerships with other major asset management firms, including Franklin Templeton, which has previously invested in Aptos (tier 3) and planned to utilize its blockchain for money market funds.\nSuch strategic alliances could position Aptos similarly to how Avalanche benefited from its partnerships in the Project Guardian initiative (JPMorgan and Wisdomtree), experiencing a substantial price increase post-announcement. “Avalanche saw a price increase of more than 4x following the ‘Project Guardian’ news,” Layergg noted.\nThey concluded, “If a partnership with BlackRock proceeds, more ‘Big partnerships’ will naturally follow.”\nAt press time, APT traded at $17.59, up 87% over the past five weeks.\nJake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Ali Martinez, a well-known cryptocurrency expert, has recently provided insights into the fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin by applying the basic economic theory of supply and demand.\nIt is worth noting that any asset’s price movement, including cryptocurrencies, is determined by the fundamental rules of supply and demand. An asset’s price tends to decrease when supply outpaces demand, while prices typically increase when supply cannot keep up with demand.\nThus, Ali Martinez has deduced the crypto asset’s price and holders’ behaviour by applying the method and other on-chain metrics. Martinez’s analysis demonstrates how fluctuations in the market’s buying interest and the availability of Bitcoin are key factors influencing its price trajectory.\nAccording to Martinez, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap witnessed a significant increase mid-way through March when BTC hit a new all-time high of $73,000. This indicated that the majority of BTC’s long-term holders were likely yielding gains at the time.\nAs a result, several investors sold their holdings, which led to a sharp rise in realized profits. Following realized profits in March, long-term holders felt safe adding over 70,000 BTC to their investments at these prices.\nMeanwhile, when the market’s growing supply of Bitcoin exceeded demand, the coin saw a substantial correction from the $73,000 level to the $57,000 level.\nGiven that short-term holders are more likely to sell their holdings due to price volatility, this decline took Bitcoin below its realized price for short-term holders, inciting fear in the market. However, despite investors’ concerns, the short-term holder’s Realized Price at the $65,500 level acted as an accumulation point.\nOn the basis of this principle, Martinez believes the likelihood of Bitcoin continuing its upward trajectory will only increase when demand for the cryptocurrency starts to exceed the supply of BTC accessible in the market.\nMartinez has underscored that the available BTC on crypto exchanges can be used to confirm these supply and demand laws. He further noted that over 30,000 BTC have been moved to private wallets for long-term storage in May, indicating confidence among holders in the potential worth of Bitcoin.\nObserving Bitcoin’s price using the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, Martinez cited a retracement above the +0.5σ pricing band at $64,600. Such an upswing has historically caused BTC to test the pricing range of 1.0σ, which is backed by increasing demand. Meanwhile, this price range at the moment is roughly lingering at $77,000.\nPresently, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $66,275, indicating an over 5% increase in the past week. Although prices are up, its trading volume has declined by 24%, while its market cap is up by 0.23%.\nMy name is Godspower Owie and i am an employee for Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlet.

Yinghao shared insights into why SevenX Ventures believes in UXLINK’s potential and how it aligns with the core principles of Web3.\n“SevenX Ventures is thrilled to announce our investment in UXLINK,” Yinghao began. “We see UXLINK striking a delicate balance at the intersection of fundamental social principles and core Web3 concepts. Starting from the first principles of social interaction, UXLINK has leveraged profound insights into the real needs and pain points of Web3 users and projects. This has allowed them to catalyze network effects and harness intrinsic Web3 incentives and wealth effects.”\n“UXLINK has quickly become the fastest-growing network with the highest quality user accumulation and strongest monetization capability among group-oriented Web3 social platforms,” Yinghao explained. “With its core principles of openness, modularity, and convenience, UXLINK has created a user-friendly development environment for various projects and developers. This enables deep and targeted connections between projects and their user bases, solidifying network depth and expanding network boundaries. From this perspective, we are bullish on UXLINK’s ability to foster asset issuance and trading through socialization, becoming a key hub linking Web3 infrastructure and application scenarios.”\n“UXLINK has introduced a groundbreaking user connection method and organizational structure through its ‘Link To Earn’ mechanism and disruptive ‘Web3-enabled groups,'” Yinghao noted. “This has led to the establishment of a unique protocol and data layer that provides substantial value to developers operating in the Web3 space. Currently, UXLINK boasts a user base of over 5.7 million registered users, with more than 100,000 groups. It also records over 1 million daily active users (DAUs) on DApps and over 300,000 on-chain daily active users (DAUs). Additionally, UXLINK’s first-season airdrop is in progress, targeting the top 10% of users and surpassing a scale of 550,000.”\n“UXLINK is dedicated to leading an integrated social ecosystem aimed at channeling Web3 traffic, social trading, and infrastructure,” Yinghao shared. “The product ecosystem is structured into three distinct layers:\n\nProduct architecture diagram:\n\n“UXLINK embodies a shift towards genuine social connections and experiences, coupled with innovation in Web3 fundamentals,” Yinghao stated. “At the heart of UXLINK is a focus on authentic interpersonal relationships that mirror real-life social dynamics. Trust, established through direct or indirect endorsements, is crucial for actions like recommendations and transactions. UXLINK’s architecture is designed to harness the power of genuine socialization, essentially functioning as a sophisticated data production machine. This generates various types of data, ranging from basic acquaintance connections to more intricate associations such as person-group, person-network, person-project, and person-asset relationships.”\n“UXLINK focuses on activating existing asset trading, facilitating the issuance and circulation of new assets, and accommodating different types of assets,” Yinghao elaborated. “By transforming personal relationships into valuable network assets, UXLINK increases the turnover frequency of assets and supports the issuance of new assets with new narratives and standards. On the financial side, UXLINK ensures that users directly benefit from their contributions to the ecosystem, promoting a sustainable and engaging environment.”\n“UXLINK serves as a super-connector, acting as a central hub between two interconnected closed loops,” Yinghao explained. “Firstly, it links users, products, and developers, addressing core needs and fostering a robust user-product community. Secondly, it bridges infrastructure, traffic, and applications, enhancing cohesion and collaboration in the fragmented Web3 landscape.”\n“The UXLINK team epitomizes the configuration of a typical S-tier founder leading an S-tier team,” Yinghao highlighted. “With several years of entrepreneurial experience in the internet industry, the team possesses exceptional expertise in product research and development, growth strategies, operations, and fundraising. Their commitment to first principles ensures a robust product-market fit, starting from actual user needs and integrating Web3 concepts effectively.”\n“As the pioneer of Web3 social products deeply rooted in personal relationships, UXLINK is rapidly constructing personal networks and achieving a phase of leadership,” Yinghao emphasized. “The platform’s objective monopoly on personal networks extends to defining scenarios and pricing resources, reinforcing its dominance in the Web3 space. The self-reinforcing networks of acquaintances and brands further enhance its value.”\n“UXLINK’s approach of ’embracing both sides’ offers a promising middle ground between decentralization and user experience,” Yinghao concluded. “By integrating decentralization with user-friendly incentives, UXLINK aims to create a more balanced and user-friendly Web3 ecosystem. This approach bridges the gap between purist and pragmatist developers, fostering sustainable and widely adopted applications.”\nIn summary, Yinghao’s insights reveal UXLINK’s thoughtful balance between idealism and practicality in Web3, creating meaningful value for developers and users alike. SevenX Ventures is confident in UXLINK’s potential to become a key hub linking Web3 infrastructure and application scenarios.\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Meme Coin Surges on Back of GameStop Nostalgia","content":" The internet’s resident amphibian is back in the spotlight, but this time Pepe the Frog isn’t gracing troll forums – he’s maneuvering his way to the top of the cryptocurrency charts. PEPE, the meme coin named after the internet legend, is experiencing a historic surge, fueled by a potent mix of nostalgia and retail investor fervor.\nPEPE’s recent ascent is nothing short of meteoric. Trading volume has skyrocketed by an impressive 300% in the past 24 hours, with the price reaching an all-time high. This dramatic rise coincides with a resurgence in Gamestop (GME) stock, leading many to believe that the retail investor army of 2021 is back for round two, armed with meme coins as their weapon of choice.\nThe return of Keith Gill, better known online as “Roaring Kitty,” has acted as a rallying cry for these digital warriors. Gill’s surprise post on his dormant Reddit account sent shockwaves through the market, reigniting the nostalgic flames of the original Gamestop saga. Analysts suggest this nostalgia has spilled over into the crypto market, sparking a full-blown meme coin craze.\nPEPE, already experiencing a steady climb since mid-April, has emerged as the unlikely champion of this digital meme menagerie.\nIt’s not just the small-time investors driving the PEPE surge. Big money, or “whales” in crypto speak, are also diving headfirst into the frenzy. On-chain data reveals a whale recently splashing out a cool 1.86 million USDC for a whopping 195 billion PEPE tokens. Another whale scooped up a hefty 406 million PEPE, further propelling the price upwards.\nThis guy spent 1.86M $USDC to buy 195B $PEPE 12 hours ago and has now made an unrealized profit of $236K.https://t.co/TSngBKN2yC pic.twitter.com/Oszxx3nIO2\n— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 14, 2024\nWhile PEPE’s current trajectory is a dream come true for early adopters, a cautionary tale lurks beneath the frothy surface. Meme coins are notorious for their wild volatility. Their value is often built on hype and fleeting internet trends, not robust financial fundamentals.

This bullish trend has analysts scrambling for their charts and telescopes, predicting a potential price explosion that could propel SOL to its all-time high (ATH) and beyond. However, amidst the excitement, some experts urge caution, reminding investors that cryptocurrency seas can be treacherous.\nThe past week has been a banner one for Solana. The price has surged nearly 20%, surpassing a key resistance level at $150 and finding support above it. This breakout is seen as a significant technical victory, indicating a shift in investor sentiment and potentially paving the way for further gains.\nAdding fuel to the fire are bullish pronouncements from prominent crypto analysts. Alex Clay, a well-respected figure in the space, has set his sights on a price target of $329 for SOL, citing a promising weekly chart structure and a recent consolidation period.\n#Solana\nWeekly Structure looks awesome🧐\nConsolidation below the Key Resistance Zone followed by breakout above the one → Now we have a retest of broken resistance as a support\nBreakout of ATH is imminent🚀\n🎯 1 Target we should meet → 328.6$#SOL $SOL pic.twitter.com/OW4xbnkXOj\n— Alex Clay (@cryptclay) May 18, 2024\nSo what’s driving this bullish sentiment? Technically, the successful breakout above resistance and the formation of a bullish chart pattern known as an “inverse head and shoulders” are positive signs. Additionally, Solana’s strong fundamentals, including its reputation for fast transaction speeds and scalability, continue to attract investors.\n\nWhile the current outlook for Solana is bright, some experts advise investors to exercise caution. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and unforeseen events can quickly disrupt even the most meticulously charted course. The recent price increase has been impressive, but the 24-hour growth remains modest, suggesting a potential for short-term fluctuations.\nMeanwhile, with its real daily average transactions per second (TPS) hitting a record high of 1,504 on April 6 of this year in the face of the memecoin fever, Solana has proven to be the fastest big blockchain. As a result, Solana is now 46 times faster than Ethereum and over five times faster than Polygon, the Ethereum scaling solution with the greatest TPS.\n\nThis remarkable achievement underscores Solana’s technological prowess and its capacity to handle high transaction volumes efficiently. The network’s ability to maintain such speed during peak demand periods, like the recent memecoin craze, highlights its robustness and scalability.\nThis performance advantage not only enhances user experience by minimizing delays and lowering transaction costs but also positions Solana as a formidable competitor in the blockchain ecosystem.\nFeatured image from National Geographic, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

{"url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-cup-handle-pattern/","web_url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/","type":"article","description":"Crypto analyst Dark Defender has identified a bullish 'Cup and Handle' pattern on the XRP daily chart, signaling potential for substantial gains.","title":"XRP Price: Cup & Handle Pattern Hints At Short-Term 208% Surge","content":" In a new technical analysis, crypto analyst Dark Defender has identified a bullish ‘Cup and Handle’ pattern on the XRP daily chart, signaling the potential for substantial gains. The pattern, which is characterized by a ‘cup’ resembling a rounding bottom and a ‘handle’ indicating a slight downward drift, suggests a continuation of an upward trend.\nDark Defender notes, “XRP formed a cup & handle pattern in the daily time frame. We set targets for $1.05 & $1.88 with the Elliott Waves, and now the Cup-Handle pattern is also blinking XRP to reach the targets.”\nThe cup formation, which began in July and extended through October, saw its peak around $1.05, a critical resistance level. The XRP price then dropped by approximately 52%, perfectly aligning with the classical setup. The correction from the top of the cup to the bottom should ideally be a maximum of 50%.\nThe subsequent handle has formed a resistance zone between $0.75 and $0.6649, which is approximately a 20% retracement from the cup’s peak. Notably, the pattern suggests a bullish continuation, where the ‘cup’ represents a period of consolidation followed by a breakout, while the ‘handle’ forms a smaller pullback before the price continues to ascend.\nWithin the chart, Dark Defender showcases key support and resistance levels crucial for this pattern to remain valid. The handle part of the pattern has potential support at $0.5286, which Dark Defender has indicated should not be broken by a close under the primary support of $0.6044 for two consecutive days to maintain the bullish outlook.\nCurrently, the chart indicates that XRP is trading above these support levels, with resistance looming overhead. The next significant resistance is noted within the handle formation, marked at $0.6649. A decisive break above this level could confirm the pattern’s predicted outcome and set XRP on its upward trajectory toward the mentioned price targets.\nThe analyst elaborates on the handle’s potential movements, stating, “Can the handle be extended towards $0.5286 Support? We still need to close under the primary support of $0.6044 for 2 days in a row. So the answer at the moment is No.” However, he also added, “The main structure is still in place, and XRP is expected to hit $1.05 & $1.88 in the short term.”\nThe XRP price is currently facing another crucial resistance when performing a Fibonacci retracement level analysis on the 1-day chart. Last Thursday, the XRP price fell below the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $0.6275 and has not been able to close above this key resistance since then on a daily basis.\nMoreover, the XRP price is sandwiched between the 20-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), between $0.6234 and $0.5919. For the bullish scenario to play out, the price needs to overcome the 20-day EMA as well as the 0.382 Fibonacci level. If this happens, Dark Defender’s bullish prediction could come a little closer.\nJake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

{"url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-cardano-whales-bags-altcoin-rally/","web_url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/","type":"article","description":"On-chain data shows XRP and Cardano whales have been accumulating recently, something that can be bullish for the prices of these altcoins.","title":"XRP & Cardano Whales Load Up Bags: Preparation For Altcoin Rally?","content":" On-chain data shows that XRP and Cardano whales have been accumulating recently, which can be bullish for the prices of these altcoins.\nAs analyst Ali explained in a new post on X, XRP whales have seen their holdings go up over the last couple of weeks. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of assets the different market groups hold.\nThe whale cohort is of interest in the current discussion. These investors hold between 1 million and 10 million XRP in their balance.\nAt the current exchange rate, these amounts are worth around $0.52 million and $5.2 million, respectively. Clearly, these are pretty significant holdings, which is why whales are considered influential in the market.\nNow, here is a chart that shows how the Supply Distribution of the entities belonging to this XRP group has looked like recently:\nThe graph shows that while the XRP price has been stuck in consolidation during the last couple of weeks, the whales have been viewing the opportunity as a buying one.\nThese humongous investors have scooped up over 110 million cryptocurrency tokens (equivalent to almost $57 million) inside this window. This buying scale isn’t particularly massive, but the fact that these investors have been backing the coin through this poor period should be an optimistic sign.\nIt would also appear that XRP isn’t the only one on the large holders’ radar recently. Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock revealed in an X post that Cardano has also seen a significant buying push.\nIn the above chart, IntoTheBlock displays the holdings of the Cardano investors, which are between 100 million and 1 billion ADA. This range’s bounds convert to about $45.3 million and $453 million, respectively, so these whales would be much more massive than the XRP ones just discussed.\nAs is apparent from the graph, these ADA entities have expanded their holdings over the past month. More particularly, their supply has grown by 11% in this period, which, when considering the scale of the total holdings of this group, is an enormous increase.\nAccording to the analytics firm, these Cardano whales now control 6.71% of the entire circulating supply of the cryptocurrency all by themselves.\nThis latest buying push towards XRP and ADA from the whales simultaneously could be a potential sign that these large entities are expecting an altcoin rally soon. Given that Cardano has seen it happen at a much more significant scale, the coin could likely see better returns than XRP if a surge does happen.\nXRP has displayed stale price action recently, as its price has continued to move sideways around the $0.52 level.\nKeshav is currently a senior writer at NewsBTC and has been attached to the website since June 14, 2021. Keshav has been writing for many years, first as a hobbyist and later as a freelancer. He has experience working in a variety of niches, even fiction at one point, but the cryptocurrency industry has been the longest he has been attached to. In terms of official educational qualifications, Keshav holds a bachelor’s degree in Physics from one of the premier institutes of India, the University of Delhi (DU). He started the degree with an aim of eventually making a career in Physics, but the onset of COVID led to a shift in plans. The virus meant that the college classes had to be delivered in the online-mode and with it came free time for him to explore other passions. Initially only seeking to make some beer money, Keshav unexpectedly landed clients offering real projects, after which there was no looking back. Writing was something he had always enjoyed and to be able to do it for a living was like a dream come true. Keshav completed his Physics degree in 2022 and has been focusing on his writing career since, but that doesn’t mean his passion for Physics has ended. He eventually plans to re-enter university to obtain a masters degree in the same field, but perhaps only to satiate his own interest rather than for using it as a means to find employment.. Keshav has found blockchain and its concepts fascinating ever since he started going down the rabbit-hole back in 2020. On-chain analysis in particular has been something he likes to research more about, which is why his NewsBTC pieces tend to involve it in some form. Being of the science background, Keshav likes if concepts are clear and consistent, so he generally explains the indicators he talks about in a bit of detail so that the readers can perhaps come out having understood and learnt something new. As for hobbies, Keshav is super into football, anime, and videogames. He enjoys football not only as a watcher, but also as a player. For games, Keshav generally tends towards enjoying singleplayer adventures, with EA FC (formerly FIFA) being the only online game he is active in. Though, perhaps due to being ultra-focused on the game, he is today a semi-pro on the EA FC scene, regularly participating in tournaments and sometimes even taking back prize money. Because of his enthusiasm for anime and games, he also self-learned Japanese along the way to consume some of the untranslated gems out there. The skill didn’t merely remain as just a hobby, either, as he put it to productive use during his exploration for small-time gigs at the start of COVID, fulfilling a couple of Japanese-to-English translation jobs. Keshav is also big into fitness, with agility and acceleration-related workouts making a big part of his program due to the relevance they have in football. On top of that, he also has a more traditional strength based program for the gym, which he does to maintain an overall fitness level of his body.\nDisclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

The analyst based his predictions on a technical analysis tool he called the “Gaussian Channel,” revealing three distinct technical phases for XRP, including a Green A, Green B and Green C phase.\nHe noted that the bearish phase in Green A had already been completed. However, the Green B phase is expected to end by June 2025, and Green C is anticipated to conclude by January 2025. The analyst further emphasized that the aforementioned dates do not represent cycle tops but indicate the beginning of a “deep bear market phase.”\nHe also revealed that the Gaussian Channel was a technical analysis tool used to visualize price movements of cryptocurrencies around a mean average price. The purpose of the tool is to help identify volatility, risks, and certain support and resistance levels. Additionally, analyzing the historical trends and durations of the green phases provided by the Gaussian Channel provides valuable insights that can be used to interpret future price movements.\nPresently, the price of XRP has remained relatively unchanged for the past few months, primarily consolidating around the $0.5 mark without witnessing any significant momentum. This lackluster performance can be attributed to the ongoing legal challenges the cryptocurrency has faced with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the past four years.\nWhile Egrag crypto anticipates more bearish sentiment for XRP in the coming year, the crypto analyst also suggests that the next 3 to 12 months could present critical trading opportunities as the market evolves. He cautions XRP holders to remain vigilant and prepared for potential market volatility, which could lead to a “life-changing window.”\nIn a previous X post, Egrag Crypto maintained an optimistic outlook for the price of XRP. He emphasized the cryptocurrency’s strength and resilience, noting that XRP was indicating strong bullish signals in its price fundamentals.\nHe revealed that if XRP can maintain a critical position within the “Launching Channel,” a trading pattern identified by partial wicking candles and ascending consolidation, the cryptocurrency could see its value potentially surging to $6.4.\nAt the time of writing, the price of XRP is trading at $0.51, reflecting an increase of 3.51%, over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\nEgrag Crypto has advised the broader XRP community to remain “calm and steady,” as the next three to six months could present significant opportunities for investors.\nScott Matherson is a prominent crypto writer at NewsBTC with a knack for capturing the pulse of the market, covering pivotal shifts, technological advancements, and regulatory changes with precision.

Mounting Resistance Threatens Rally","content":" BNB, the native cryptocurrency of the BSC network, has undoubtedly been one of the winning altcoins scene the bull market began. The price has been able to go from around $200 to over $600 in the space of a year, notching over 200% gains in the process. However, it seems that this outperformance by the altcoin is coming to an end, as an analyst predicts that it is about to hit massive resistance that could stop its growth dead in its path.\nIn an analysis that was shared on the TradingView website, crypto analyst Trade City Pro revealed that the BNB token might have to fighting massive resistance soon. The analyst points out that this is a culmination of the bullish rally that the altcoin has seen in the last year, and now bears are maki g their stand.\nThe analyst points to Bitcoin’s performance during this time as something that could help to pinpoint where the BNB price is headed next. As they explain, BNB risks falling into correction and consolidation after that, making its current level a perilous one for investors.\nMainly, the crypto analyst credits the altcoin’s performance from here on what Bitcoin does next. BNB, which is currently the 4th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, mirrors Bitcoin’s movements to a larger extent compared to smaller altcoins. So, Trade City Pro’s analysis with respect to Bitcoin is not far off.\nFor confirmation of whether the BNB token continues to be something to sell or hold, the analyst places the ultimate decision around the $48,000 level for Bitcoin. They explain that a dump below $48,000 would be a sell signal. However, if the Bitcoin price were to maintain strength above $48,000, then they would continue to hold the altcoin.\nShould the BNB price crash from here, the crypto analyst has prepared an action plan that could help investors take advantage of it. For example, a Bitcoin crash below $48,000 could send the BNB price below $400, and at this level, the analyst believes buying would be a good move. This is what the analyst refers to as the “Potential Re-Entry” point.\nThen, for “Entering After Resistance,” the analyst advises investors to buy the altcoin if the price is able to reclaim $616 and stay above it. This level is important because the $616-$660 range is identified in the analysis as a significant resistance zone, and so beating it is important for the BNB price to continue its rally.\nRelated Reading: How High Can The XRP Price Go? Crypto Analyst Unveils 6-Month Prediction\nAdditionally, Trade City Pro adds that the Fibonacci Retracement Levels might offer a level for re-entry into the altcoin. “In case of a correction, the key Fibonacci levels from the last upward wave at 0.5 and 0.618 (between $394 to $430) might offer good entry points. Wait for a reaction or momentum change at these levels before entering,” they stated.\nLastly, the analyst points out that BNB has not really followed the broader market in recent times, which could mean something is coming. “It’s intriguing that BNB seems relatively unaffected by broader market conditions, suggesting Binance might be positioning for something unique,” Trade City Pro said in closing.\nScott Matherson is a prominent crypto writer at NewsBTC with a knack for capturing the pulse of the market, covering pivotal shifts, technological advancements, and regulatory changes with precision.

The growth of Zeebu must be contextualized within the broader expansion of the blockchain-based transaction space, where it is not only participating but leading the charge.\nIn just a few months following the launch of Zeebu’s on-chain settlement platform, the company impressively managed to settle thousands of invoices, rapidly progressing from an initial $1 billion to now surpassing $2 billion in transactions. This growth underscores the platform’s scalability and the robust demand for its services.\nZeebu has become a pivotal player in blockchain-based settlements for the telecom sector, offering an instant payment and settlement solution that significantly reduces transaction times from days to minutes and cuts out intermediaries through the use of smart contract technology.\nThe core of Zeebu’s innovation is the ZBU Token, which not only facilitates global transactions but also enhances participant engagement through a loyalty and rewards system. This tokenization strategy effectively tackles common financial hurdles like high fees, delays in remittance, and issues with currency exchange, making it an ideal solution for cross-border settlements.\nThe platform’s usage has expanded substantially, with a growing number of telecom carriers and businesses leveraging Zeebu’s capabilities. As the platform evolves, Zeebu continues to attract new users who recognize its benefits, reinforcing its position as a trusted and leading payment platform in the market.\nThe data from Zeebu’s dashboard reveals that the overall transaction volume on the platform has already crossed over $2 Billion. At the time of writing, the number of invoices settled stands at 32k+, with total users around 465.\nSome of the company’s achievements this year included two massive token burn events and participation in leading telecom and Web3 events across the globe. The first token burn occurred in February 2024, removing over 236 million ZBU tokens from circulation, accounting for more than 4.7% of the total supply.\nThe second burn took place in May 2024, removing an additional 239 million ZBU tokens, reinforcing Zeebu’s commitment to a sustainable token ecosystem through its Phoenix Protocol, which automates and governs the burn process to ensure a balanced token supply.\nIn addition to these token burns, Zeebu has actively expanded its presence by participating in and sponsoring major telecom and Web3 events across the Middle East, the Americas, and other regions. This strategic involvement has helped Zeebu establish a strong foothold in these markets and increase its brand visibility.\nTo further raise awareness about Zeebu, the company partnered with CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to host several campaigns. These efforts, coupled with listings on prominent exchanges, have significantly enhanced Zeebu’s market presence and credibility.\nMoreover, Zeebu released a major update to its Payment Service Provider (PSP) platform, introducing governance features that enable telecom merchants to transition from passive users to active participants in the ecosystem. This update enhances the overall user experience and fosters a more engaged community within the Zeebu platform.\nRaj Brahmbhatt, Founder and CEO of Zeebu, added, “This milestone is a significant leap forward in our journey, clearly aligning with our broader strategic goals. As the telecom industry increasingly embraces innovative payment solutions such as blockchain, our extensive experience and proven ability to provide exceptional user experiences and customized financial solutions uniquely position us to meet the growing demands of this dynamic sector.”\nLooking ahead, Zeebu is set to further enhance its services, expand its ecosystem, and transition towards a more decentralized and community-driven governance model.

This price action has ignited discussions about ADA’s potential to revisit its 2021 glory days, when it reached a peak of $3.10.\nThe recent price increase can be attributed to two key factors: a surge in buying pressure and a potential upcoming “battle of the whales.”\nOn-chain data reveals that retail investors, the so-called “whaley” masses, have been accumulating ADA aggressively, particularly between $0.48 and $0.50. This large cluster of buyers could act as a support system if the price reaches that level.\nHowever, lurking beneath the bullish sentiment is a potential obstacle. Data shows that only 40% of current ADA holders are in profit.\nA price increase to $0.49 could be particularly significant, as it could push the ratio of holders in loss below 55%. This milestone could trigger further buying pressure as more investors see an opportunity to move into profit territory.\nCardano’s price rally is also being fueled by a significant rise in trading volume, reaching a weekly high of $461 million according to Santiment. This surge in activity indicates growing interest in ADA, which could propel the price further upwards.\nBut can this momentum be sustained? The answer might lie with the “original whales,” the large investors who hold a significant portion of the cryptocurrency.\nInterestingly, the current distribution of ADA shares some similarities with the market conditions in 2021, when the price hit $3. Back then, whales held roughly 6% of the total supply. Today, that number sits at nearly 7%, suggesting a potential return of these big players.\nHowever, analysts caution that the success of this “whale comeback” narrative depends heavily on the broader market cycle. If the current bull market reaches its peak, ADA’s price growth could be restricted, hindering its ability to revisit its all-time high.\nCardano’s recent price surge has instilled a sense of cautious optimism in the cryptocurrency community. While the strong buying pressure from retail investors and the potential return of whales are positive signs, the profitability of current holders and the unpredictable nature of the market cycle pose challenges.\nIn the coming weeks, it will be crucial to observe whether ADA can overcome the selling pressure at $0.49 and sustain its upward trajectory. If trading volume continues to rise alongside the price, and if the current bull market holds, ADA might just surprise everyone and revisit its much-anticipated $3 mark.\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

The exchange is hosting five times as much volume as Coinbase.\nThe analyst notes that the difference between the two would be even higher when considering the BTC-FDUSD pair, which isn’t included in the data depicted in the above chart.\nDespite the much lower spot volume, Coinbase still hasn’t been irrelevant in the market. For example, the platform is the custodian for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC.\nThere also appears to be an interesting pattern between the dominance of the American exchange and the Bitcoin spot price. The quant has highlighted this trend in the graph.\nThere have been a few instances where a rise in the spot trading volume of Coinbase against Binance has preceded surges in the value of cryptocurrency. Similarly, declines in the platform’s dominance have seemingly led to drawdowns in the Bitcoin price.\nThe analyst has also discussed the trend in the volumes of the two exchanges more closely, using the spot volume ratio for them, as shown below.\nThe chart shows that the spot volume ratio between Binance and Coinbase had spiked to very high levels in 2023, with the former’s volume being 53 times the latter’s. The reason behind this was the zero-fee scheme that Binance had introduced for the Bitcoin trading pairs.\nHowever, Coinbase’s volume has recently risen, although the ratio remains notably in favor of Binance. This shift in the market emerged as the Bitcoin spot ETF-related news started to intensify.\nThe quant concludes:\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $61,800, down 3% over the past week.\nKeshav is currently a senior writer at NewsBTC and has been attached to the website since June 14, 2021. Keshav has been writing for many years, first as a hobbyist and later as a freelancer. He has experience working in a variety of niches, even fiction at one point, but the cryptocurrency industry has been the longest he has been attached to. In terms of official educational qualifications, Keshav holds a bachelor’s degree in Physics from one of the premier institutes of India, the University of Delhi (DU). He started the degree with an aim of eventually making a career in Physics, but the onset of COVID led to a shift in plans. The virus meant that the college classes had to be delivered in the online-mode and with it came free time for him to explore other passions. Initially only seeking to make some beer money, Keshav unexpectedly landed clients offering real projects, after which there was no looking back. Writing was something he had always enjoyed and to be able to do it for a living was like a dream come true. Keshav completed his Physics degree in 2022 and has been focusing on his writing career since, but that doesn’t mean his passion for Physics has ended. He eventually plans to re-enter university to obtain a masters degree in the same field, but perhaps only to satiate his own interest rather than for using it as a means to find employment.. Keshav has found blockchain and its concepts fascinating ever since he started going down the rabbit-hole back in 2020. On-chain analysis in particular has been something he likes to research more about, which is why his NewsBTC pieces tend to involve it in some form. Being of the science background, Keshav likes if concepts are clear and consistent, so he generally explains the indicators he talks about in a bit of detail so that the readers can perhaps come out having understood and learnt something new. As for hobbies, Keshav is super into football, anime, and videogames. He enjoys football not only as a watcher, but also as a player. For games, Keshav generally tends towards enjoying singleplayer adventures, with EA FC (formerly FIFA) being the only online game he is active in. Though, perhaps due to being ultra-focused on the game, he is today a semi-pro on the EA FC scene, regularly participating in tournaments and sometimes even taking back prize money. Because of his enthusiasm for anime and games, he also self-learned Japanese along the way to consume some of the untranslated gems out there. The skill didn’t merely remain as just a hobby, either, as he put it to productive use during his exploration for small-time gigs at the start of COVID, fulfilling a couple of Japanese-to-English translation jobs. Keshav is also big into fitness, with agility and acceleration-related workouts making a big part of his program due to the relevance they have in football. On top of that, he also has a more traditional strength based program for the gym, which he does to maintain an overall fitness level of his body.\nDisclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

This drop comes amid growing speculation that the highly anticipated Ethereum ETFs will likely be rejected by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the upcoming May deadline.\nAccording to a recent Reuters report, various US Bitcoin ETF issuers and firms anticipate the SEC’s denial of their applications to launch ETFs tied to the price of ETH.\nThese expectations have been fueled by “discouraging meetings” between the applicants and the regulatory agency in recent weeks, as disclosed by four individuals familiar with the matter.\nProminent investment firms such as VanEck, ARK Investment Management, and seven other issuers have submitted filings with the SEC to list ETFs that would track the spot price of Ethereum.\nAs the first in line, VanEck’s and ARK’s applications are subject to the SEC’s decisions by May 23 and May 24, respectively.\nThe sources involved in the meetings between Bitcoin ETF issuers and the SEC have reported that the discussions have been primarily “one-sided,” with agency staff not engaging in substantive details about the proposed products.\nThis starkly contrasts the intensive and detailed discussions between issuers and the agency before the SEC’s landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\nThe issuers argued during the meetings that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum futures-based ETFs by the SEC in October set a precedent for the spot ETH products. They also made efforts to address potential regulatory concerns.\nDespite their arguments, the report notes that the SEC staff did not clarify specific concerns or engage in meaningful dialogue, further indicating a possible denial of the requests.\nIf these expectations materialize, it would be a setback for the cryptocurrency industry, which had hoped that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs would pave the way for similar products and contribute to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF analysis at data firm VettaFi, the likely delay in approval or rejection until later in 2024 or beyond has left the regulatory landscape uncertain.\nWhile some issuers have expressed their intention to submit additional disclosure paperwork to continue the conversation with the SEC, the overall sentiment indicates a growing belief that the applications will be rejected.\nVanEck CEO Jan van Eck has already stated that the company’s application will likely be rejected, while ARK Investment Management has yet to comment.\nSeveral applicants expect the SEC to cite broader issues, such as the nature and depth of statistical data on the underlying ETH market, as reasons for their decision in the event of ETF rejections.\nMatt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which has filed for a spot in Ethereum ETF, believes that the SEC may require more time to observe Ethereum futures and gather additional data.\nIndustry insiders further speculate that rejecting Ethereum ETFs could potentially lead to legal action, with one source suggesting that the courts may get involved before Ethereum ETFs eventually become a reality.\nThe anticipated rejection has already influenced the price of Ethereum, with Hong Fang, president of the crypto exchange OKX, stating that the cryptocurrency is experiencing downward pressure as market participants factor in the likelihood of a negative outcome.\nCurrently, ETH is trading at $3,100, further highlighting the cryptocurrency’s persistent downtrend over broader time frames. Over the past fourteen and thirty days, the token has experienced significant declines of 12% and 14%, respectively.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\nRonaldo is an experienced crypto enthusiast dedicated to the nascent and ever-evolving industry.

After a brief surge, LTC finds itself stuck in a price tug-of-war, with analysts divided on whether it will climb to $90 or fall back to its support level near $80.\nLast week’s price action for LTC was a rollercoaster ride – not the kind that sends investors screaming with joy, but a slow, rickety climb followed by a disappointing stall. Despite breaking the $80 barrier on May 15th, LTC’s momentum fizzled out, leaving it hovering around $83.81 at press time.\nPopular crypto analyst, CRYPTOWZRD, isn’t mincing words. Their recent tweet paints a picture of indecision, with LTC trapped in a price range between $80 and $94. A breakout, either bullish or bearish, seems imminent, but the direction remains a mystery.\nLTC Daily Technical Outlook:$LTC closed indecisively today and it is trading in the middle of a Daily range area. I will pay more attention to the intraday chart development tomorrow to get a quick scalp 👀 pic.twitter.com/T5hAFTndIu\n— CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) May 19, 2024\nTo decipher LTC’s next move, analysts are turning to on-chain metrics – the digital breadcrumbs left behind by cryptocurrency transactions. Here, too, the picture is far from clear.\n\nGlassnode’s NVT ratio, a measure of undervaluation, is flashing red, suggesting a potential price dip. However, a low reserve risk metric hints at an upcoming surge in bullish sentiment. Whale activity, often a bullish indicator, remains high, and the MVRV ratio, which gauges profitability for long-term holders, has also taken an upward turn.\nMeanwhile, technical indicators offer a glimmer of hope for LTC bulls. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits comfortably above the neutral mark, suggesting the coin isn’t overbought.\nOne damper on the party spirit comes from the Bollinger Bands, a volatility indicator. LTC’s current position within the bands suggests a period of low volatility, making a sudden price surge less likely.\nThis subdued volatility is significant because Bollinger Bands typically tighten when market prices consolidate, signaling a lack of strong directional movement. For LTC, this means that without an external catalyst to drive momentum, the likelihood of a dramatic price breakout is diminished.\nFor LTC to reach its holy grail of $90, it needs to conquer a crucial resistance level at $85. This hurdle could be particularly challenging due to potential liquidations that might occur at that price point.\nOn the downside, if LTC fails to hold its ground at the $80 support level, a price drop to $78 could be on the cards.\nFeatured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

The revelation comes from none other than David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, who disclosed his involvement in advising Trump’s campaign to adopt policies favorable to the crypto industry.\nBailey, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, shocked many when he unveiled his team’s role in guiding Trump’s campaign towards embracing Bitcoin and other digital assets. Bailey revealed that they had proposed a crypto-focused executive order to be signed on Trump’s first day back in office, signaling a significant departure from Trump’s previous skepticism towards cryptocurrencies.\nIt’s time for Bitcoin to elect the next President of the United States.\n— David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.65m/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) May 11, 2024\nTrump’s shifting stance on cryptocurrencies has been nothing short of remarkable. Once vocal about his disdain for digital assets, Trump now appears open to embracing them, contrasting sharply with President Biden’s purported lack of understanding of the crypto space. This evolution has ignited discussions about the potential impact of a Trump presidency on the crypto industry.\nFor the past month we have been working with the Trump campaign to develop their bitcoin and crypto policy agenda. We proposed a comprehensive executive order for President Trump to sign on day 1. I will be sharing those details soon. This week Trump took the first step, but…\n— David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.65m/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) May 11, 2024\nBailey’s announcement has sparked debates within the crypto community, with some viewing it as a strategic move to ensure a more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\nHowever, others question the motives behind supporting Trump, citing concerns about his controversial tenure as president. Bailey himself clarified that their actions are aimed at defending Bitcoin rather than endorsing Trump personally.\n\nWith the upcoming presidential elections looming, the role of Bitcoin in shaping political landscapes has never been more apparent. Bailey’s call to mobilize and ensure a pro-Bitcoin president raises questions about the growing influence of cryptocurrency in electoral politics.\nWill Bitcoin enthusiasts unite to sway the outcome of the elections in favor of a crypto-friendly candidate?\nGeoff Kendrick, head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank, weighed in on the potential implications of a Trump second term for the cryptocurrency industry.\nKendrick believes that a Trump presidency would likely result in a more supportive regulatory environment, offering hope to crypto advocates amidst ongoing regulatory uncertainties.\nThe news of Trump’s potential support for cryptocurrencies has stirred both excitement and caution in the market. While some see it as a promising sign for increased adoption and investment, others remain wary of the potential volatility and uncertainty associated with Trump’s involvement.\nThe impact on crypto prices will depend on factors like regulatory clarity and broader market sentiment, making it essential for investors to stay informed and adaptable in the face of evolving developments.\nFeatured image from AP Photo/Jeff Dean, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

However, experts are cautioning","title":"Dogecoin: One Metric Holds The Key To Its Next Rally","content":" Dogecoin, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency that took the internet by storm in 2021, has seen a recent uptick in price. However, experts are cautioning investors against mistaking this blip for the start of a moon mission.\nOne factor tempering enthusiasm is Dogecoin’s current lack of volatility. While price swings are often a hallmark of the cryptocurrency market, DOGE’s volatility has hit a 30-day low.\nThis calmness suggests the recent price increase might not translate into a sustained upward trend.\nMemecoins like Dogecoin thrive on volatility, and the current lull suggests a period of price stability, which isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s unlikely to trigger the explosive rallies we’ve seen in the past.\n\nAnother dampener on the celebratory champagne showers is the low user activity on the Dogecoin network. The number of active addresses, which indicates user engagement, is currently hovering around 52,000.\nThis is a significant drop compared to March 2024, when a surge in active addresses coincided with a price jump to $0.22.\n\nHistorically, spikes in Dogecoin’s user activity have foreshadowed price increases. The current low suggests a lack of excitement or, perhaps, a period of accumulation by investors who are waiting for the right moment to jump in.\nFor the past few weeks, Dogecoin’s price has been stuck in a consolidation phase, oscillating between $0.14 and $0.16. This sideways movement, while frustrating for those hoping for a quick return, could be a sign of a different kind of preparation.\nConsolidation periods often precede significant breakouts. While it doesn’t guarantee a future surge, it suggests the price is finding support and could be coiling for a potential leap.\nA beacon of optimism comes from the MVRV Z Score, an indicator that suggests Dogecoin might be currently undervalued.\nThis metric essentially compares the market value of a coin to its historical value. A score below a certain threshold suggests the coin might be undervalued and has room for growth.\nThe current data paints a picture of a cautious future for Dogecoin’s price. While a major rally seems unlikely in the immediate future, there are underlying hints that suggest potential for growth.\nThe low volatility and user activity could be signs of consolidation and accumulation, respectively, both of which could precede a future price increase.\nFeatured image from @inevitable360/X, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

The token has been under the watchful eye of analysts, with many anticipating a significant upward move in its value.\nInjective’s recent price action has caught the attention of market observers, specifically a bullish breakout from a falling wedge pattern. This pattern is often seen as a sign of a reversal in downtrends, and Injective’s successful breakout suggests a potential shift in market sentiment towards the token.\nThe breakout from the falling wedge is a welcome sign for Injective investors, said Jonathan Carter, a renowned crypto analyst. This technical indicator often precedes a price increase, and in INJ’s case, we’re seeing several upside targets that could be reached in the near future, he said.\n\nCarter has outlined a series of potential price milestones for Injective, ranging from $27 to $44. Each target represents a stepping stone in INJ’s potential price appreciation, and analysts are closely monitoring the token’s performance to see if these targets can be achieved.\n#INJ\nInjective has broken the falling wedge pattern and now is retesting a descending resistance line👀\nThe upside targets after bounce from this line are $27.0, $30.0, $36.5, $39.5, and $44.0🎯 pic.twitter.com/prwGdIKOs9\n— Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) May 11, 2024\nAdding fuel to the fire, other crypto analysts have echoed Carter’s optimistic outlook on Injective. World Of Charts, another popular analyst in the crypto space, acknowledges a recent breakout by INJ but emphasizes the need for a confirmed surge past a descending channel. However, their prediction aligns with Carter’s, suggesting a significant price increase is on the horizon, with a target of $50.\n$Inj\nStill Consolidating In Descending Channel Incase Of Successful Breakout Expecting Move Towards 50$ #Crypto #Inj #Injec pic.twitter.com/pZIO7iZXov\n— World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) May 11, 2024\nBeyond technical indicators, the positive sentiment surrounding Injective is bolstered by its strong trading volume. Currently, INJ boasts a 24-hour trading volume of $252 million, signifying healthy market activity and investor interest. This strong volume indicates that investors are eager to get their hands on INJ, potentially driving the price even higher.\nWhile the future remains uncertain, the combined factors of bullish technical indicators, strong trading volume, and overall positive sentiment from analysts paint a promising picture for Injective. Investors are eagerly awaiting further confirmation of a price breakout, and if successful, Injective could be poised for a significant price increase in the coming months.\nFeatured image from dubizle, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

While the price struggles for direction, its underlying network is experiencing a surge in activity.\nAccording to crypto data firm Santiment, May 4th saw a whopping 200,000 new Ethereum addresses created, marking the highest single-day growth in nearly two years.\nThis surge suggests a renewed interest in the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially driven by factors like the burgeoning Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space and the ever-evolving world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\n📈 #Ethereum rebounded back above $3,200 this weekend, and saw massive network growth. 196.71K new addresses were created on the $ETH network on May 4, 2024, the largest single day of growth since October 8, 2022. This should be viewed as a #bullish sign. https://t.co/l9iFVWCJpE pic.twitter.com/MlHQTvKKN0\n— Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 6, 2024\nThis network growth is a bullish signal, and indicates strong and increasing interest in Ethereum, which could translate to significant capital inflows when macroeconomic conditions become more favorable.\n\nWhile the network thrives, Ethereum’s price currently sits at $2,995, a 1.8% decline in the past 24 hours. This puts it precariously close to falling below its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a technical indicator often interpreted as a sign of bearish momentum.\nHowever, a closer look reveals a potentially bullish twist. The price decline is accompanied by a drop in trading volume, which could indicate that selling pressure is waning. Historically, such a scenario has sometimes preceded a price reversal, where buyers re-enter the market, pushing prices upwards.\n\nThe recent weakness in the US economy, highlighted by a disappointing jobs report, has sparked speculation that the Federal Reserve might consider easing interest rates. This could inject fresh liquidity into the market, potentially benefiting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to analysts, a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve could be a game-changer for Ethereum. Lower interest rates generally make holding cryptocurrencies more attractive compared to traditional fixed-income investments.\nThe future path of Ethereum remains uncertain. While the network’s fundamentals appear robust, the price faces immediate challenges. Navigating this complex scenario will require investors to carefully consider both the on-chain activity and the broader economic landscape.\nRegulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies will undoubtedly play a crucial role in attracting institutional investors, a potential catalyst for significant price growth.\nFeatured image from Book My Flight, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

The verdict was delivered in Seattle federal court and marks the culmination of US authorities’ multiyear investigation into Binance.\nThe sentence handed down to Zhao was notably less severe than the three-year prison term sought by federal prosecutors. In contrast, the defense had requested five months of probation, ultimately given the outcome wanted.\nUnder the terms of a settlement reached in November of 2023, Zhao agreed to step down as CEO of Binance, as part of an agreement to resolve the investigation.\nThe probe primarily focused on allegations that Binance failed to implement an effective anti-money laundering program, as the Bank Secrecy Act required.\nZhao was also accused of knowingly allowing Binance to process transactions involving funds derived from unlawful activities, including transactions between US citizens and individuals residing in sanctioned jurisdictions.\nAs part of the resolution, Binance was ordered to pay an imposing $4.3 billion fines and forfeiture. Additionally, Changpeng Zhao personally agreed to pay a substantial $50 million fine, underscoring the severity of the charges and the commitment to accountability.\nThe legal challenges for Binance do not end there. The company faces separate lawsuits from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for alleged mishandling of customer assets and operating an illegal, unregistered exchange within the United States.\nAs of this writing, the exchange’s native token, Binance Coin (BNB), is trading at $573, down over 3% in the last 24 hours and 7% in the last seven days.\nFeatured image from Bloomberg, chart from TradingView.com\nRonaldo is an experienced crypto enthusiast dedicated to the nascent and ever-evolving industry.

This unique technical pattern suggests that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could see its price ascending further, potentially kick-starting a highly welcomed bull run this cycle.\nBitcoin’s price has often followed distinct historical patterns, with the majority of these indicators preceding significant rallies or bearish trends. One of the most compelling signs that Bitcoin may be turning bullish again is seen as the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator breaks below the lower Bollinger Bands, a technical indicator used to measure a market’s volatility and momentum.\nAccording to a crypto analyst identified as ‘Dominando Cripto’ on X (formerly Twitter), the SSR is a unique technical tool designed to evaluate the market sentiment by comparing the supply of stablecoins to Bitcoin. This tool is used by analysts and traders to identify buying and selling opportunities for Bitcoin. Additionally, it quantifies how the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the SSR moves within the Bollinger Bands.\nDominando Cripto has provided an in-depth explanation of how the SSR oscillator is calculated and how to interpret its signals for identifying bullish trends.\n“The oscillator is calculated by taking the difference between the current Stablecoin Supply Ratio value and its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), then dividing it by the standard deviation of the SSR over the same period,” the analyst stated.\nSharing a price chart depicting movements of the SSR oscillator, the crypto analyst suggests that when the oscillator moves above the upper Bollinger Bands, it suggests that the SSR is significantly higher than normal levels. This indicates that stablecoins are dominating the market, signaling bearish sentiment and a potential downturn for Bitcoin.\nConversely, when the oscillator falls below the lower Bollinger Band, it indicates that the SSR is low, highlighting the reduced dominance of stablecoins and signaling bullish sentiment that could potentially trigger an incoming rally in Bitcoin.\nIn the above price chart, Dominando Crypto pinpointed several instances when the SSR oscillator displayed bearish and bullish sentiment, identifying these periods as heated zones and cold zones, respectively. Recent market movements indicate that the SSR oscillator is in the cold zone, indicating a potential bullish outlook for Bitcoin.\nOn May 18, Blockchain analytics platform, Santiment, revealed a new market trend where small traders are consistently liquidating their BTC holdings, even as the cryptocurrency has shown positive performance lately.\nThe analytics platform noted that historically, when small wallets dump coins into larger wallets, it is considered an encouraging sign for Bitcoin, indicating a potential bullish turnaround for the pioneer cryptocurrency.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $66,955, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has been on a major bullish momentum recently, witnessing an 8.94% increase in the last seven days and a 4.25% surge over the past month.\nScott Matherson is a prominent crypto writer at NewsBTC with a knack for capturing the pulse of the market, covering pivotal shifts, technological advancements, and regulatory changes with precision.

After dipping below $2,820, it surged to over $3,200, only to retrace some of those gains. However, analysts remain optimistic, citing technical indicators and a key regulatory decision on the horizon as potential catalysts for a near-term price increase.\nTechnical analysts are pointing to bullish signals suggesting a potential bounce back for Ethereum. Analyst Titan Of Crypto believes a successful “Bullish Cypher Pattern” has played out, with all projected targets met. Currently, Ethereum sits at a pivotal support level, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, often seen as a springboard for upward momentum in bull markets.\n#Altcoins #Ethereum Bounce incoming.\nThe Bullish Cypher Pattern played out perfectly and all the targets got reached 🎯.#ETH is currently at the 38.2% Fibonacci retrace level also called “1st stop”.

An optimistic outlook anticipates a price rebound from here.\nAdding to the bullish sentiment, analyst JACKIS emphasizes the significance of Ethereum’s recent surge above $4,000 in March. This, according to JACKIS, represents a significant shift in the market structure towards a long-term uptrend.\nTHE GIGANTIC CRASH for #ETH isn’t coming\nHere is a reality check: We are in a big HTF range for #Ethereum and with the push to 4K in March we have broken 🗝️ market structure to the upside\nAlso, the local Weekly MS leading into it remains bullish, marked on the chart with HL… pic.twitter.com/QisXiDUXxr\n— JACKIS (@i_am_jackis) May 13, 2024\nThe price of Ethereum could receive a significant boost from an upcoming decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). By May 25th, the SEC is expected to rule on three applications for Ethereum-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).\nA green light from the SEC for these ETFs would open the door for institutional investment into Ethereum, potentially leading to a surge in demand and price. Conversely, a rejection could dampen investor sentiment and trigger a pullback.\nA closer look at Ethereum’s weekly chart reveals a bullish undercurrent despite the recent price dip.

Notably, only six","title":"Why Is The Crypto Market Down Today? Key Reasons Explained","content":" The crypto market is in the red today, with a majority of the top-100 cryptocurrencies reflecting losses over the last 24 hours. Notably, only six altcoins, including two stablecoins, have managed to maintain a positive performance amidst a broader market sell-off.\nSeveral complex and intertwined factors have contributed to the day’s negative market sentiment, affecting major cryptocurrencies. Over the last 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin has decreased by 4.2%, Ethereum has fallen by 5.0%, Solana has dropped by 8.7%, XRP has declined by 4.7%, and Dogecoin has decreased by 8.3%.\nA primary factor influencing today’s market movements is the evolving macroeconomic landscape, particularly concerning US interest rates and inflation expectations. At the beginning of the year, the market anticipated aggressive monetary easing by the Federal Reserve. However, the sentiment has shifted considerably based on recent data and Federal Reserve signals.\n“Markets are pricing in fewer rate cuts for this year compared to the Fed’s dot plot projection of 3 rate cuts by year end. The implied fed funds rate for December has risen to 5.0%, indicating that the futures market is pricing in only 1 to 2 rate cuts,” Cetera Investment Management stated via X (formerly Twitter).\nThis week, all eyes are on the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for March—the Fed’s favored inflation measure on Friday, April 26 at 8:30 am EDT. Until then, the market could be in a derisk mode.\nThe PCE is anticipated to present a varied view of inflation trends, which could strengthen the Federal Reserve’s inclination to delay any increases in interest rates. Analysts predict a slight increase in the overall PCE Price Index, rising to 2.6% year-over-year from 2.5% in February. Additionally, they expect a decrease in the index’s month-over-month change, dropping to 0.30% from 0.33%.\nThe crypto market has also been rocked by yesterday’s legal developments involving the Samourai Wallet. The US Federal prosecutors’ decision to charge the founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business has sent ripples through the crypto community. This action underscores the ongoing regulatory scrutiny within the crypto space.\nThe prosecution of Samourai Wallet’s founders not only raises questions about the future of cryptographic privacy but also significantly impacts market sentiment as it underscores the legal risks inherent in the crypto sector. The implications of this case extend beyond the immediate legal concerns, influencing broader market perceptions and investor confidence.\nFurther insights into market dynamics come from prominent crypto analysts who have commented on the state of market liquidity and trader behavior. “The market has gifted us with a beautiful reset in trader positioning for Bitcoin. OI weighted funding turned negative for the first time since October 2023. That was before Bitcoin ran from 27k to 46k without any meaningful dip,” said Ted, a crypto analyst on X.\nThis reset refers to a reduction in the overheated futures market, which could allow the market to consolidate and potentially build a base for future upward movements.\nEmperor, another crypto analyst, described the current market state through a series of tweets, highlighting the ongoing consolidation phase post-highs: “Too much panic still on the timeline but we’ve been ranging since the ATH, that’s all.”\nHe added, “The bear/bull line is an important resistance + Point of Control (PoC) of our range. Expecting VaL (Value Area Low) to hold on pullbacks and VaH (Value area High) to be the next target on longs if we reclaim level 1.”\nBitcoin Price Update\nToo much panic still on the timeline but We've been ranging since the ATH, that's all\n1.

Only Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark Invest’s ARKB had minimal inflows. GBTC sold more again at -$130.4m and BlackRock had zero inflows for the first time ever since inception on January 11. Thus, BlackRock’s (IBIT) inflow streak ended at 70 days. Prior to this, IBIT entered into the top 10 all time after passing the ETFs like JETS, BND and VEA.\nYesterday's ETF flows by @FarsideUK.

The last notable day of inflows was on March 26, when they surpassed $400 million—nearly a month ago. On the bright side, despite this slowdown, there have been no outflows from either BlackRock or Fidelity. Grayscale’s GBTC remains the primary negative factor driving outflows.\nFurthermore, there seems to be a decrease in investment willingness among traditional sector investors; the total inflows through ETFs have been stagnant for more than 30 days, coinciding with a flat trend in Bitcoin prices.\nAt press time, BTC traded at $64,034.\nJake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Dogecoin (DOGE) prices dipped this week after news broke of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issuing a Wells Notice to Robinhood, a popular crypto exchange.\nThe notice, a precursor to potential enforcement action, alleges Robinhood violated multiple securities laws. This sent shockwaves through the crypto community, with many investors, particularly those holding large amounts of DOGE (often nicknamed “whales”), pulling their funds out of Robinhood.\nThe most significant outflow involved a whopping 164 million DOGE, worth roughly $25 million at the time, being transferred out of the exchange. This mass withdrawal by a whale investor likely contributed to the market jitters surrounding DOGE.\n🚀🐕 Another 164M $DOGE, worth $25M, have been transferred out of Robinhood.\nThese transactions occurred after the platform received a Wells notice from the SEC. #DOGE #Robinhood #CryptoNews\nSource: MartyParty pic.twitter.com/oKxW1S8pTD\n— Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 8, 2024\nThe price of DOGE tumbled 5.8% in the 24 hours following the Robinhood news. However, analysts caution against a knee-jerk reaction. While the legal troubles undoubtedly cast a shadow on Robinhood, the DOGE outflow, including the 164 million transfer, might not be the sole culprit behind the price dip.\nTransferring cryptocurrency from an exchange to a personal wallet is often seen as a bullish move, indicating an intention to hold for the long term.\nAnother factor influencing DOGE’s price is its tight correlation with Bitcoin (BTC). Both currencies operate on the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which some see as outdated compared to newer, energy-efficient models.\nThe recent pullback in the broader crypto market, especially in Bitcoin, likely played a role in dragging DOGE down as well.\n\nDOGE enthusiasts were eyeing a price target of $0.20, but the recent drop presents a roadblock. The memecoin dipped below the crucial $0.15 support level, raising concerns about a further decline.\nAnalysts point to a potential support zone between $0.143 and $0.146, but a fall below that could trigger a more significant price correction.\nDespite the short-term pessimism, there are glimmers of hope for DOGE. The buy orders for DOGE currently outweigh sell orders by a significant margin, suggesting continued investor interest.\nRelated Reading: Forget The Price Dip: Ethereum Network Activity Hints At Imminent Takeoff\nAdditionally, the memecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at a neutral 47, indicating there’s room for new buyers to enter the market. Furthermore, DOGE managed to maintain a weekly price increase despite the daily drop, hinting at underlying resilience.\nThe coming weeks will be crucial for Dogecoin. The outcome of Robinhood’s legal battle with the SEC and DOGE’s ability to regain lost ground will determine its short-term trajectory.

This comes as analysts raise concerns about the cryptocurrency’s weakening technical indicators and its potential breach of a key support level.\nIn a recent report, Joao Wedson, a crypto analyst at CryptoQuant, observed a significant spike in whale activity on the Toncoin network. Transactions exceeding 100,000 TON (roughly equivalent to $645,000 at current prices) surpassed a staggering $1 billion in the past few weeks. This indicates that major holders have been actively moving large amounts of TON, but the purpose behind these movements remains unclear.\n\nWhile the whales are certainly making a splash, Wedson said it’s not necessarily translating to smooth sailing for TON’s price. He pointed out that while large transactions dominate the network’s volume (over 50%), their impact on the price seems negligible. Conversely, smaller transactions, although constituting the majority of overall activity, contribute a much smaller share of the total volume.\nToncoin’s price has been exhibiting signs of weakness despite the influx of whale activity. Notably, TON recently dipped below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a technical indicator used to gauge short-term trends. This suggests that the average price of TON over the past 20 days has been on a downward slope, signifying a shift towards selling pressure.\nAdding to the bearish sentiment is the imminent crossover of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. The MACD line appears poised to fall below its signal line, which traditionally indicates a loss of upward momentum and a potential price decline.\nThese technical indicators are flashing red flags for TON. If the price breaches the lower line of its ascending channel, which has been acting as a support level, a drop to $5.70 is a distinct possibility.\nThe current situation surrounding Toncoin presents a conundrum for investors. The substantial whale activity hints at potential bullish interest, but the technical indicators paint a bleak picture.\nThe key question remains: are the whales accumulating or distributing? If they’re accumulating, this could be a buying opportunity before the price rebounds. However, if they’re selling off their holdings, it could be a sign of a distressed ship.\nFeatured image from Vikks/Shutterstock, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

Wacy predicts a selective yet explosive growth phase for altcoins, emphasizing the critical nature of asset selection and market timing.\nWacy’s recent thread underscores the anticipation of a massive altseason: “Only ~15% of altcoins will bring 10-100x in this hyper growth. Asset selection matters more than ever. One slip-up, and you’re out.” His analysis highlights the potentially selective nature of the upcoming market phase, suggesting significant disparities in performance among altcoins.\nWacy believes the market is currently undervalued and primed for a significant uptick. He suggests that the consolidation of the total altcoin market cap above $700 billion would confirm the bull trend, signaling the onset of altseason. This perspective is rooted in current market behaviors where sentiment remains largely bearish, presenting a contrarian opportunity for growth.\nHe categorizes the current sentiment into three types of capitulation—price, time, and growth—indicating varied investor behaviors that often precede market recoveries. The prevailing fear of further drops, according to Wacy, will likely clear out weak hands, setting the stage for a supercycle driven by Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and subsequent strong buying activities.\n#1 And #2: WIF as well as PEPE are the memecoins highlighted by Wacy as potential early movers in the anticipated altseason. “Look at WIF and PEPE, structurally similar to DOGE during its meteoric rise. These coins have cultivated a community and meme appeal that could very well parallel SHIB’s market cap in the previous cycle,” Wacy asserts. He notes that PEPE appears particularly poised for a breakout, whereas WIF, though currently weaker, has the potential for quick shifts in market sentiment.\n#3 Ondo Finance (ONDO): This Real World Asset (RWA) focused coin is characterized by its robust buy support during price dips. Wacy sees ONDO as an undervalued asset with a significant upside. “ONDO has a resilient buy floor; even slight retractions to around $0.64 could offer lucrative entry points ahead of substantial upward trajectories,” he advises. His first target is the $1.62 price zone.\n#4 Arweave (AR): Known for its decentralized data storage solutions, Arweave is praised by Wacy for its strong market structure and resilience during downturns. Moreover, Arweave is building AO, a decentralized computer network which can be run from anywhere. “Arweave isn’t just storage; it’s a foundational technology in a decentralized future. A consolidation above $49 would likely be the catalyst for an explosive growth phase,” he predicts.\n#5 Echelon (PRIME): Wacy discusses PRIME’s multifaceted ecosystem, which encompasses a trading card game and an AI-powered game, both of which are gaining traction. “Echelon stands at the confluence of gaming and blockchain technology, attracting a broad audience with its innovative gameplay and decentralized features,” he remarks. From a technical analysis perspective, the PRIME price is near a favorable buying zone from $14.97 to $17.5. “Hoping that altcoins are already entering the altseason, would like to see a V-shaped reversal,” Wacy states.\n#6 Ethena (ENA): This synthetic dollar protocol offers an alternative to traditional banking and is poised for growth. “Ethena’s pattern on the weekly charts typically precedes major price movements. With the next major unlock event slated for April 2025, the buildup could be substantial,” Wacy explains. He likens ENA’s current price trajectory with the one of SEI.\nWacy also provides strategic advice on profit-taking, anticipating that the altcoin market index, TOTAL3, could ascend to between $2 trillion and $2.3 trillion during the altseason. He suggests considering partial profit-taking once the market reaches approximately $1.6 trillion. His rationale is based on historical patterns where many investors fall prey to greed, resulting in substantial losses.\nThe analyst further advises preparing a profit-taking strategy in advance, advocating for the reservation of 10-15% of positions for potential further growth beyond initial targets. He warns that the last surge in a growth phase often triggers excessive greed, suggesting that recognizing such signals could be crucial for timely exits before the onset of bear market conditions.\nAt press time, WIF traded at $3.58.\nJake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

{"url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/investment-firm-makes-bitcoin-its-strategic-reserve-impact-on-price/","web_url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/","type":"article","description":"Early-stage investment firm Metaplanet announced on Monday that it's adopting Bitcoin (BTC) as its sole \"strategic treasury reserve asset.\" This audacious","title":"Bitcoin: Investment Firm Makes BTC Its Strategic Reserve","content":" Early-stage investment firm Metaplanet announced on Monday that it’s adopting Bitcoin (BTC) as its sole “strategic treasury reserve asset.”\nThis audacious decision signals a growing confidence in the controversial cryptocurrency as a legitimate store of value and hedge against traditional economic woes.\nMetaplanet’s decision comes amidst a backdrop of sustained economic pressures in Japan. A weakening yen, coupled with high government debt levels and persistently low-interest rates, seems to have pushed the firm to seek alternative havens for its reserves.\nBitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized nature, appears to be their answer.\nIn a clear statement of intent, Metaplanet outlined its new “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only approach” to treasury management. The company plans to strategically convert its existing yen liabilities and future share issuances into BTC, effectively accumulating more of the digital asset over time.\nThis strategy echoes the recent moves of US-based MicroStrategy, which has become a major institutional holder of Bitcoin.\n\nMetaplanet’s press release paints a glowing picture of the top crypto asset’s potential. They view it as “fundamentally superior” to traditional currencies and other investment options, highlighting its scarcity and lack of a central issuer.\nThey are impressed by Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, emphasizing how it creates a progressively higher cost of production for the remaining coins yet to be mined. This, they argue, stands in stark contrast to traditional commodities whose supply can be readily increased.\n\nThere are clear parallels between Metaplanet’s strategy and that of MicroStrategy. The US firm has aggressively amassed Bitcoin, currently holding over 1% of the entire circulating supply. Metaplanet, though smaller, has reportedly acquired over 117 BTC since April, signaling their commitment to replicating this strategy.\nWhile Metaplanet’s decision reflects a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, it also carries significant risks. Bitcoin’s price remains highly volatile, with the potential for substantial losses if the market takes a downturn.\nAdditionally, the regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and future regulations could negatively impact Bitcoin’s viability as a reserve asset.\nMetaplanet’s bold move serves as a fascinating case study. Their all-in bet on Bitcoin raises questions about the future of traditional reserve assets and the potential for wider adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors.\nThe company’s investment, while significant for a single firm, represents a relatively small portion of the total Bitcoin market capitalization. However, the news itself could generate positive sentiment and short-term price increases, especially if it entices other institutional investors to follow suit.\nConversely, if Metaplanet’s strategy backfires and they are forced to sell their Bitcoin holdings at a loss, it could trigger a broader sell-off and price decline.\nUltimately, the long-term impact will depend on how this bold move by Metaplanet plays out, alongside broader market forces and evolving regulations.\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

This time around, it is the small-time traders who are offloading their bags and putting selling pressure on the price. However, this is not an entirely bad thing given that, historically, such selling has been bullish for the Bitcoin price.\nIn a report on X (formerly Twitter), the on-chain data tracker Santiment revealed an interesting trend among small-time Bitcoin investors. As the price of Bitcoin rallied past $67,000 over the weekend, these small wallets took this as the time to sell and secure profit.\nThese wallets are those holding below 0.1 BTC on their balances. This means that at the high end, these wallets are holding an average of $6,000. In the space of one week, Santiment notes that their collective holdings had dropped 0.46%.\n🐟👋 #Bitcoin is dancing just above $66.1K as small traders continue to #liquidate their holdings despite the #crypto bounce over the past week. Historically, small wallets dumping their coins to larger wallets is an encouraging and #bullish sign for $BTC. https://t.co/wlz4XPhfMD pic.twitter.com/dTJAy5G6pL\n— Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 19, 2024\nSelling among smaller wallets is not new, but at this level, it could have a significant impact on the price. However, compared to when whale and sharks sell their BTC holdings, retail investors selling is usually bullish for the price. This is because as the smaller traders sell, the BTC is picked up by the larger traders, who are usually longer-term holdings.\nAs blockchain agency Crynet explains in a response to Santiment: “While small traders divesting might seem concerning, it’s often a bullish signal. Historically, this redistribution to larger holders indicates stronger hands in the market. Let’s see how this plays out.”\nThe selling by small Bitcoin traders comes amid a jump in bullishness. As Santiment reported in a previous post, bullishness among Bitcoin investors has now jumped to a 4-month high. The last time that investors were this bullish was back in January 2024 when the price of BTC had jumped above $45,000.\nBitcoin’s weighted sentiment is now sitting at a value of 0.99, and although this is still lower than its January high of almost 1.8, it remains one of the highest among large caps. Currently, only the Chainlink (LINK) weighted sentiment is higher after rising to a new one-year high of 1.829.\n🥳 The crowd’s sentiment has shifted toward #Bitcoin after the surprise bounce above $66K Wednesday (and now above $67.2K). Additionally, #Chainlink is seeing its most #bullish sentiment in over a year. #FOMO staying low will help these rises continue. https://t.co/TcEPBdS9Oh pic.twitter.com/czvE1mOgId\n— Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 17, 2024\nThe Ethereum weighted sentiment is currently sitting at a low -0.44, while XRP and Binance’s BNB are sitting at around -0.37. This suggests that bearishness continues to dominate among these assets while crypto investors look to Bitcoin to lead the market.\nAt the time of writing, the BTC price is still trading at a high price of $66,900. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is seeing a 6.78% increase in the last week and a small decline of 0.5% in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.\nScott Matherson is a prominent crypto writer at NewsBTC with a knack for capturing the pulse of the market, covering pivotal shifts, technological advancements, and regulatory changes with precision.

Emerging Altcoins to Explode During the Bull Run","content":" Bitcoin (BTC) did not have the spike in price many predicted after its halving event. History had told us BTC would reach an all-time high soon after the event but it is likely the all-time prices set earlier in the year distorted its chances. Bitcoin then lost a bit of its gains and started to hiver around the $60-$62k mark.\nNow Bitcoin has started to rally again and, at the time of writing, is above $66k. This has led experts to ponder, what is next for Bitcoin. In an interesting piece, one crypto writer provides data that suggest the bulls could push Bitcoin all the way to $90k which would be yet another all time high in 2024.\nWhile Bitcoin may be headed to new heights we think investing in these up-and-coming altcoins could see more explosive returns on investment. We found seven presale tokens we think have the unique properties necessary to explode during the next bull run. Here they are:\nLet’s take a look at each project and see why they are promising investments.\n>>>Get The Best Crypto Now<<<\nReaders who pay close attention to the presale market would have noticed more Dogecoin alternatives popping up. This is not a coincidence, Dogecoin (DOGE) has only made minuscule gains when compared to other meme coins during a period of explosive growth for the whole sector. Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) could be the final nail in the coffin as its presale indicators DOGE investors are jumping ship.\nThe Dogeverse presale began less than two months ago but has already raised well north of $15 million. This is not normal for a meme coin so it definitely indicates a changing of the tides. Dogeverse itself is also modeled around a pup meme but this dog is a space called Cosmo. He was born with the unique ability to jump from chain to chain.\nThis makes Doegverse a multi-chain token and also the first project that will be available on six networks. Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, and BNB Smart Chain are the layer 1s, alongside Layer 2s such as Polygon and Base. Given Solana’s surprise rise past Ethereum as the most popular network with altcoin investors, this move by Dogeverse gives it versatility for the future.\n>>>Buy Dogeverse Now<<<\nAs you will see this list is very heavy on meme coins. The market is exploding and April saw an all-time high 138 new releases added to the sector. Solana has been the network that has stared during this expansion as a lot of the best performers come from its network. Hoping to be next up on this list is Sealana ($SEAL).\nWe love the subtle nature of the meme behind Sealana as it’s a well-meaning dig at crypto enthusiasts based on an inaccurate stereotype. The character Sealana is based on is actually a gamer from the “Make Love Not War’ episode. The character keeps killing the boys characters in the game World of Warcraft. The joke is to be a player this strong you have to have no life and play the game 24/7.\nSealana is a seal version of this character who is a patriot that is stuck in his mom’s basement trading crypto all day. We know meme coin lovers can take a joke and we think they will love Sealana. Rumors that the people behind Slerf Token (SLERF) are also involved with Sealana only strengthen our prediction that it will pump.\n>>>Buy Sealana Now<<<\n\nOne development the meme coin market has seen recently since its explosion in popularity is the merging of meme coins with other entities. One of the most popular is AI. The new technology has been coveted by the crypto market as many see it as a way to attract investors.\nWienerAI ($WAI) has taken a very interesting approach to incorporating AI into its project. Nearly every single other meme coin project has used AI to add utility in some way. WienerAI, however, wishes to go down the traditional meme coin route of the actual meme being the attraction. This means they wish to rely on virality so they have used AI to give its meme a background story.\nIt begins in the year 2132 where we are transported to a place called New Silicon Valley. We find ourselves in a laboratory owned by a mad scientist who goes by the architect. Here he is devising an experiment that combines pups and AI. However, at the last second, he accidentally drops a sausage into the mix and we are left with WienerAI. We think this story will attract tons of investors.\n>>>Buy WienerAI Now<<<\nOne thing that investors should look out for when investing in a new project is industry knowledge. One example of this is when creators involved with one successful project start another. Another is what we have with 99Bitcoins Token ($99BTC). They run the biggest crypto learning platform on the market and now they have turned their attention to Web 3.\nThey have sold over 2 million courses to crypto enthusiasts and have over 750k followers of their YouTube channel so there is a good chance a portion of you reading this have gained some valuable knowledge from them. The presale has so far raised over $1.3 million as investors seem to be excited to see what they will bring to the crypto market.\nHow the learn-to-earn model works is investors will be able to learn $99BTC by passing through levels of the curriculum and by interacting with the community. What’s great about this is investors can learn more about the market while also earning crypto. $99BTc can be used to access premium content, purchase partner content, and of course trade on the market.\n>>>Buy 99Bitcoins token Now<<<\nThe crypto market prides itself on being ahead of the curve and that is exactly what 5thScape (5SCAPE) is doing with this project. They believe that the future of VR will be tokenized and they are hoping to lead the charge with this futuristic coin.\nIf you purchase the 5SCAPE token you will have access to the best VR educational resources, the latest blockbuster movies, and of course the best VR video games. Although they do plan to release their own in-house VR goggles, the creators have made the current version compatible with other VR headsets already on the market like the Oculus.\nWith presale tokens, the amount the project raises isn’t always indicative of how the listings will go but one that raises a lot during the presale period is still a great sign. The 5thScape presale is just about to hit the $6 million raised mark which is a clear indicator that investors are ready for the future of VR.\n>>>Buy 5thScape Now<<<\nSponge V2 ($SPONGEV2) is a meme coin we are very excited about. Who can blame us when you consider how successful version 1 Sponge Token ($SPONGE) was? The people behind the project have also come up with a very innovative way to go from one project to the other, a problem a lot of other projects have faced before.\nThe process is called stake-to-bridge. Investors who wish to purchase the new $SPONGEV2, must first purchase and then stake the original $SPONGE. When they do so an equivalent amount of version 2 is purchased and stored away for them. Once the total allocation of version 1 is sold out then version 2 will launch and investors will receive their $SPONGEV2 along with their staking rewards.\nSponge V2 will add an exciting P2E racing game to add utility to the ecosystem. Given how successful Sponge Token was this could make it huge. In 2023, Sponge Token was launched and soon became a cult hero. It pumped by hundreds of percent in a bearish market and eventually ended up on 10 exchanges.\n>>Buy Sponge V2 Now<<<\n\nPikamoon (PIKA) has chosen a route for its project we can fully get on board with. The meme coin/P2E crossover is always a good combination but taking inspiration from a traditional giant is the icing on the cake. The creators will be hoping to entice fans of Pokemon, one of the largest traditional gaming franchises of all time, to try this blockchain version.\nPlayers will be able to explore four different universes in the game which together are called the Pikaverse. They will do this alongside the NFT sidekick they mint at the beginning of the game. Players can earn PIKA in-game by completing challenges and battling other players.\n>>>Get The Best Crypto Now<<<\nSo, despite some ambitious Bitcoin forecasts we have decided to look elsewhere for coins that should explode during the next bull run. With a meme coin-heavy focus, all the projects contain unique qualities necessary to attract investors. We are confident all of them can provide a good ROI.\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Based on the expert analysis, Dogecoin, which has attracted a lot of attention and interest from investors lately, may be preparing to build on its current momentum and make more gains.\nA symmetrical triangle chart pattern is a consolidation phase that precedes a forced breakout or decline in price. A new bearish trend begins with a breakdown from the lower trend line, while a new bullish trend begins with a breakout from the upper trend line.\nAccording to the analyst, the symmetrical triangle pattern presents a major obstacle for DOGE at the $0.1545 price level. At the same time, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) continues to provide support at the $0.1513 level.\nEven though the current market price is above the 50 EMA and suggests a bullish bias, Crypto Daily Trade Signals noted that Dogecoin has to surpass the resistance level of $0.1595 in order to confirm that the upward trend is continuing.\nThis perspective is further strengthened by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is currently above the 50 EMA and supports a purchasing trend.\nThe post read:\nDogecoin has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, presenting a significant hurdle around the $0.1545 mark. Simultaneously, support persists around the $0.1513 level, reinforced by the 50-day EMA.\nThe expert highlighted that DOGE is at a pivotal point around $0.15100 on the 4-hour chart, indicating a bullish momentum, and an immediate resistance at the $0.15950 mark. The first obstacle to be cleared is the immediate resistance at $0.15950, which is followed by the $0.16980 and $0.18440 levels.\nAlthough caution is advised if DOGE drops below the pivot point, the RSI’s current position indicates an opportunity for more profits. Thus far, the upward trend is supported by a firm base provided by the 50-day EMA around $0.15130.\nMeanwhile, on the negative side, $0.14270 provides immediate support, while $0.13240 and $0.12030 provide additional levels of support, with the RSI at 53, which denotes neutral conditions.\nCrypto analyst Javin Marks has also shared insights on Dogecoin’s recent price action, predicting a potential massive rally to $12. According to the expert, based on previous breakouts and runs, DOGE has maintained its broken status once more.\nThese runs have become bigger one after the other, and the last run recorded over 20,000% upsurge. Given the nature of the runs, Javon Marks anticipates the recent run, which might be in its early stage now, to be bigger than the last one.\nAs a result, the expert experts DOGE to reach $12 or even higher following the run. Also, Marks noted that after the run has concluded, DOGE could see another massive rise of over 7,500%.\nMy name is Godspower Owie and i am an employee for Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlet.

Why Altcoin's Price Continues Downward Plunge","content":" The once-booming cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP) finds itself in a precarious position. The past month has been marked by a significant drop in XRP’s value, leaving investors and analysts in a state of flux.\nWhile some fear a continued decline, others see potential for a comeback, with technical indicators hinting at a possible reversal of fortune. However, the road ahead for XRP remains shrouded in uncertainty, with the ongoing legal battle with the SEC and broader market sentiment playing a crucial role.\nThe last few weeks have been a rough ride for XRP holders. The cryptocurrency, which once held the distinction of being the only one with apparent regulatory approval in the United States, has shed over 5% in the last week alone.\nThe price dipped as low as $0.49 before recovering slightly to its current position around $0.50. This downtrend has coincided with a noticeable dampening of enthusiasm within the crypto community. Discussions about XRP have dwindled, and the usual “bullish” fervor seems to have gone quiet.\nDespite the gloomy outlook, there are some glimmers of hope for XRP. Analysts point to technical indicators on TradingView that suggest a potential uptrend in the making.\nThe chart shows a series of “higher lows and higher highs,” a pattern typically associated with bullish momentum. Additionally, the $0.50 mark seems to be acting as a support level. Each time the price dips close to this point, it rebounds slightly, indicating that some investors see it as an attractive entry point.\nThis bullish sentiment is echoed by some experts. Dark Defender, a prominent crypto analyst, remains optimistic about XRP’s prospects for 2024, predicting a surge to $1.80 before year’s end. A recent poll conducted by Egrag Crypto among nearly 4,000 crypto community members also revealed mixed feelings.\nWhile a significant majority (61%) expressed optimism about XRP’s ability to participate in an upcoming bull run, a sizable minority (40%) remained apprehensive.\n\nXRP’s path forward is far from certain. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to cast a long shadow. The lawsuit, which centers around whether XRP is a security, has created uncertainty in the market, hindering investor confidence.\nThis regulatory ambiguity makes it difficult for institutional investors to enter the XRP market, further dampening its potential for significant growth.\nThe broader bearish sentiment currently gripping the crypto market also adds pressure to XRP’s price. Bitcoin, the bellwether of the cryptocurrency market, has seen a significant correction in recent months, dragging many altcoins, including XRP, down with it. This creates a domino effect, where negative sentiment in one cryptocurrency bleeds over to others, further exacerbating the decline.\nFeatured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

According to Yoddha, Ethereum is expected to rally massively after a period of accumulation and decline, continuously rising above $10,000 by the end of the year.\nThe analyst’s ambitious predictions are based on historical trends exhibited by Ethereum from 2016 to 2024. He shared a chart depicting Ethereum’s price action over these years, highlighting periods of accumulation, interim peaks and volatility.\nYoddha disclosed that from 2019 to 2021, Ethereum witnessed a period of accumulation marked by multiple price fluctuations, including long declines and short rallies. Following this, Ethereum surged significantly, reaching a peak of $4,867 towards the end of 2021. This price range aligns with the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of $4,878, achieved during the previous bull market cycle in 2021.\nBased on these historical trends, Yoddha identified a similar accumulation phase in Ethereum’s price movements during this current market cycle. The analyst noted that from 2022 to early 2024, Ethereum experienced an accumulation and slightly bearish phase.\nPrior to reaching a record high of $4,088 on March 12, 2024, Ethereum had experienced a bearish trend in 2022 and 2023. The cryptocurrency also faced declines on several occasions in 2024, especially around April and May.\nYoddha has indicated that Ethereum has successfully concluded this accumulation and bearish period and is on track to witness a massive rally towards $15,346, extending into the end of 2024.\nIn another X post, Yoddha indicated that Ethereum could start the upcoming altcoins season. The crypto analyst has consistently emphasized the impending launch of the highly anticipated altcoins season in 2024.\nHe revealed that altcoins will begin to gain more attraction once the hype surrounding meme coins diminishes. Additionally, Yoddha revealed that 2024 could issue the biggest altcoins season, encompassing healthy pullbacks and new all-time highs.\nPresently, the price of Ethereum is trading at $3,024, reflecting a 1.58% decline over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. A surge above $10,000 will require the cryptocurrency to jump by more than $7,000, fueled by a notable uptick in investor demand and interest in the cryptocurrency as well as the potential introduction of an Ethereum Spot ETF in 2024.\nCrypto analyst, Ali Martinez has revealed that currently, Ethereum’s TD Sequential is presenting a “buy signal” on ETH’s daily price chart. He predicts that Ethereum could witness a rebound of one to four candlesticks from its recent price drop.\nScott Matherson is a prominent crypto writer at NewsBTC with a knack for capturing the pulse of the market, covering pivotal shifts, technological advancements, and regulatory changes with precision.

This positive price performance by the maiden cryptocurrency has been attributed to the low inflation levels reported in the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.\nHowever, Bitcoin is an asset subject to the influence of several forces. According to a report by blockchain analysis platform LookonChain, BTC may soon experience another price rally following an increase in the supply of a specific stablecoin.\nIn an X post on Friday, LookonChain reported that the Tether Treasury has minted an additional 1 billion USDT indicating a consistent rising demand for the stablecoin. USDT which ranks as the third largest cryptocurrency doubles as the most dominant stablecoin in the crypto space with a market cap value of $111.25 billion.\nThe USDT token has famously recorded much growth in the last year with over 31 billion new tokens minted on the Tron and Ethereum network. Interestingly, LookonChain reveals that this rise in USDT market share contributed significantly to Bitcoin’s ascent from $27,000 to $73,000 in the past fifteen months.\nThe theory behind this relationship stems from an increase in traders’ liquidity provided by investments in USDT. This increased market liquidity can alter the status of Bitcoin’s supply and demand and oftentimes lead to a rise in BTC’s price.\nFollowing the most recent 1 billion USDT minted by the Tether Treasury, most investors and spectators could be expecting a similar boosting effect on Bitcoin’s price, especially with the crypto bull season in play.\nHowever, Bitcoin’s price in the coming months is still likely to be influenced by other factors such as the BTC spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. According to data from SoSoValue, net inflows on Friday reached $177.01 million bringing the total value of the Bitcoin spot ETF market to $12.58 billion. As more major traditional finance players gain a piece of this novel market, Bitcoin is expected to experience monumental levels of demand which will translate into weighty price gains.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $66,853, reflecting a 9.64% gain in the last week. The crypto market leader is currently in a consolidation state as it gathers momentum to break past the 67,000 resistance zone.\nBitcoin is likely to remain the “diamond” of the crypto bull season for many investors based on historical price data. However, there remains a need for proper research by all investors and traders before engaging the market.\nSemilore Faleti is a cryptocurrency writer specialized in the field of journalism and content creation.

One such project is RCO Finance (RCOF), a decentralized trading platform that addresses the barriers associated with traditional financial systems.\nXRP facilitates international payments, making them faster and more efficient. This eliminates the delays common with traditional payment methods, which often take days or weeks.\nHowever, XRP’s primary focus on payments and lack of complete decentralization may be why RCO Finance (RCOF) could replace XRP as one of the best cryptocurrency trading platforms.\nRCO Finance (RCOF) is a platform that will allow users to enjoy the full benefits of tokenization. Once launched, investors can buy stocks with crypto, bonds, commodities, and FX.\nThe platform also features innovative features such as AI trading and DeFi debit cards for fiat conversions.\nThe XRP token is currently valued at $0.5247 with a trading volume of $1.04 billion. However, its singular focus on this international payment is a notable drawback.\nOnce RCO Finance (RCOF) is launched, it has the potential to outshine XRP with its diverse and innovative offerings.\nRender (RNDR) is a blockchain-powered platform that’s breaking the barriers of traditional cloud solutions. The platform provides peer-to-peer GPU Cloud rendering power for creatives.\nRender (RNDR) offers content creators a budget-friendly, high-performance solution for scaling their projects by utilizing pooled GPU resources worldwide. In addition, creatives are rewarded with Render (RNDR) tokens for contributing their creativity and GPU resources.\nThe Render (RNDR) token is currently valued at $10.15 with a trading volume of $305.9 million. Traditional cloud solutions are quite costly for creative individuals. Render (RNDR) bridges this gap by democratizing GPU cloud rendering.\nThis approach to distributed rendering could disrupt the traditional cloud-sharing model. However, its relevance is limited to the creative industry alone. RCO Finance (RCOF), on the other hand, has a far-reaching user base.\nRCO Finance (RCOF) is a cryptocurrency trading platform that empowers investors with the autonomy to invest in crypto assets and traditional financial assets like stocks and foreign exchange (FX).\nRather than just offering single-use cases and complex processes like Render (RNDR), RCOF Finance (RCOF) provides users with a simple and broader DeFi solution.\nRCO Finance (RCOF) provides pioneering AI software that identifies market trends and performs trade transactions autonomously. The platform offers DeFi Cards, which take crypto transactions to a new level.\nThe DeFi card provides an easy way to spend and maintain crypto assets as if they were fiat currencies worldwide.\nRCO Finance (RCOF) currently offers presale tokens, which users can use to trade crypto, stocks, real estate, and bonds. Early investors on the platform can earn recurring passive income with quarterly dividends.\nInvestors will also be entitled to up to 40% discounts, which could be more as the platform grows. In addition, early adopters can buy each token at the presale price of $0.0127, potentially setting themselves up for significant gains.\nFor more information about the RCO Finance Presale:\nVisit RCO Finance Presale\nJoin The RCO Finance Community\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

Price Stalemate At Crucial $140 Support","content":" Solana (SOL), the high-speed blockchain network, is facing a balancing act. While experiencing a short-term price bump, analysts warn of a potential plunge if a key technical level crumbles.\nSOL’s price has seen a recent uptick of 3.60%, currently hovering around $162. However, this seemingly positive movement comes against the backdrop of a broader downward trend. Analysts attribute this shift to a change in market sentiment.\nMeanwhile, the altcoin’s RSI is 48, which denotes a neutral position. As a result, SOL has room to move in either direction because it is neither overbought nor oversold.\nA drop in trading activity has been observed, which is typical of periods of consolidation. A spike in trade volume following a breakout should confirm the trajectory of the trade.\nCrypto analyst Alan Santana emphasizes the significance of the Exponential Moving Average 100 (EMA 100) as a critical support level for SOL. The EMA 100 acts as a technical indicator, reflecting the average price over the past 100 days.\n✴️ Support Weakens | Solana To Crash Below 100#SOL | #Solana\nA trend following system uses a moving average as the main tool to generate trading signals for a system trader; the moving average is like the holy grail of technical analysis, together with the RSI.\nThe moving… pic.twitter.com/9d5NrjuWWR\n— Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) May 14, 2024\nHistorically, SOL has found support at this level during bullish periods. In September and October 2023, price breakouts above the EMA 100 signaled positive market sentiment. However, the recent trend reversal has cast a shadow over this once reliable indicator.\n\nSantana warns that a drop below the current EMA 100, sitting at roughly $140, could trigger a significant downturn for SOL.\nThis breach could instill fear among investors, potentially leading to a sell-off and pushing the price even lower. The analyst cautions of a possible plunge below $100 if such a scenario unfolds.\nWhile the technical analysis paints a concerning picture, it’s crucial to remember the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.\nShort-term predictions based on technical indicators may not always hold true. Other factors, such as industry news, regulations, and broader market trends, can also play a significant role in price movements.\nFor instance, a positive regulatory stance towards cryptocurrencies could boost investor confidence and lead to a price increase, even if technical indicators suggest a downtrend.\nConversely, negative news surrounding a blockchain hack or security vulnerabilities could trigger a sell-off, defying bullish technical signals.\nSolana’s future trajectory remains uncertain. Will the $140 price point become a launchpad for a recovery, or will it crumble, sending SOL tumbling down deeper?\nFeatured image from Pngtree, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

Analyst Makes Bold Claim","content":" A fresh prediction has ignited discussion in the XRP community. Analyst Cryptobilbuwoo is charting an ambitious course for the cryptocurrency, with a potential price target that has some investors excited and others skeptical.\nCryptobilbuwoo’s forecast draws inspiration from historical patterns, particularly the XRP rally of 2017. By leveraging Fibonacci retracement levels, a common technical analysis tool, they see a potentially similar scenario unfolding for the altcoin.\nImagine a roadmap to the summit. Fibonacci levels act as checkpoints, highlighting potential resistance or support zones during a price rise. Cryptobilbuwoo suggests XRP could break through the $33 mark, aligning with the key Fib. 1.618 level.\n\nThis would be a significant step forward, but the real climb comes next – a projected ascent to $589, based on the Fib. 2.382 level.\nHowever, there’s a significant hurdle to overcome. To reach $589, the coin would require a staggering price increase of over 100,000%. This ambitious target has many market analysts raising eyebrows. It’s a leap that some consider more akin to wishful thinking than a realistic market prediction.\nOther crypto market analysts present a contrasting view, suggesting XRP could even fall to zero. While this scenario seems extreme, it underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.\nAt the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5004, down 1.4% and 4.2% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows.\nMeanwhile, in the XRP community, the $589 narrative used to be the main focus. The community’s excitement to see XRP at $589 is evident in the tweet below:\nIt seems that most of the XRP community would hate to wake up tomorrow to a $589 XRP, as this would mean they could no longer accumulate it. But then again $589 is still cheap and actually nothing compared to what is actually coming! pic.twitter.com/hvySrx0RpY\n— Dr. Huber🔥🦅🔥 (@Leerzeit) May 7, 2024\nDespite the skepticism surrounding the $589 target, there are positive signs for XRP. The coin has displayed resilience, consistently hovering above the psychologically important $0.50 level.\nAdditionally, a trend of investors moving XRP off exchanges has emerged. This could indicate a more long-term bullish outlook and potentially reduce selling pressure.\nTechnically, Cryptobilbuwoo finds support for their prediction in XRP’s historical price charts. They point to a descending triangle pattern on the XRP/BTC chart, a formation that preceded XRP’s breakout in 2017. Could this be a sign of history repeating itself?\nThe future for XRP likely lies somewhere between the extremes. The $589 target might be overly optimistic, but a measured upswing based on technical indicators and reduced selling pressure remains a possibility.\nFeatured image from Reddit, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

Notably, this figure makes Solana 46 times faster than Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\nFurthermore, Solana’s TPS is more than 5 times faster than Polygonm (MATIC), which currently holds the highest TPS among Ethereum scaling solutions.\nAccording to CoinGecko, this demonstrates the superior processing power of the non-EVM blockchain and its ability to handle a large influx of transactions, especially during periods of heightened market activity, such as the recent Memecoin mania, specifically within the Solana network.\nHowever, it’s important to note that despite Solana’s performance, the blockchain has only achieved 1.6% of its “theoretical maximum speed” of 65,000 TPS. This suggests that there is still significant room for improvement, and the network’s upcoming upgrades will be closely watched to see how quickly it can record even higher real TPS.\nThe second-fastest blockchain in the study is another non-EVM protocol, Sui (SUI), which recorded its highest real TPS of 854 in July 2023 as the on-chain game Sui 8192 gained popularity. Other fast blockchains among the non-EVMs include The Open Network (TON) at 175 TPS and Near Protocol (NEAR) at 118 TPS.\nIn contrast, the non-EVM blockchains that have recorded relatively lower real processing speeds are Aptos (49 TPS), Starknet (12 TPS), Bitcoin (11 TPS), and Thorchain (2 TPS).\nCollectively, the 8 non-EVM large blockchains have an average peak TPS of 284, which is 3.9 times faster than the 17 largest EVM and EVM-compatible blockchains, which have an average of just 74 TPS.\nThe EVM-compatible blockchain that has achieved the fastest real TPS is BNB Smart Chain (BSC), which recorded 378 TPS on December 7th, 2023, amid the surge in on-chain activity driven by the inscriptions craze. This performance places BSC as the fastest Ethereum-based blockchain, though it still lags behind the top non-EVM protocols.\nSimilarly, the surge driven by inscriptions allowed Polygon to record 190 TPS on November 16th, 2023, making it the fastest among the largest Ethereum scaling solutions and 8.4 times faster than Ethereum itself. However, the leading non-EVM blockchains still outpacing even Polygon’s impressive speed.\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $168, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours and registering an impressive 720% gain year-to-date.\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com\nRonaldo is an experienced crypto enthusiast dedicated to the nascent and ever-evolving industry.

This comes amidst a period of impressive performance for FLOKI, defying a sluggish overall market.\nWhile the cryptocurrency market has faced turbulence recently, FLOKI has been charting its own course. Over the past month, the meme coin has skyrocketed by 40%, showcasing resilience and defying the broader market sentiment. This bullish run continued in the last 24 hours, with FLOKI registering a further 18% increase in price.\nAdding fuel to the fire are technical indicators. Keen-eyed analysts have spotted a bullish pennant formation on FLOKI’s charts, a technical pattern that often precedes a significant price breakout.

Captain Faibik, a respected analyst in the crypto space, has meticulously combed through FLOKI’s charts and identified the bullish pennant formation on the daily timeframe. Faibik anticipates a robust bullish rally in the medium term, projecting gains of approximately 180-200%.\n$FLOKI is Breaking out of Bullish Pennant on the Daily timeframe Chart..!!\nLooks Extremely Bullish for the Midterm, Expecting +180-200% Bullish Rally.. 📈🚀#Crypto #FLOKİ #FLOKIUSDT pic.twitter.com/2Fgxq05Oq8\n— Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) May 14, 2024\n\nAnother analyst, known by the moniker World Of Charts, echoes Faibik’s sentiment.

Bitcoin fell","title":"Toncoin Outshines Bitcoin With Price Surge And Social Buzz","content":" The native token of the Telegram-connected Open Network, Toncoin (TON), has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) despite the recent market turbulence. Bitcoin fell by 3% over the last week, while TON increased by nearly 20%. Within the cryptocurrency world, this unexpected outperformance has set off a wild speculating frenzy. Will TON’s rapid ascent continue, or is this merely a passing blip?\nOne key factor behind TON’s recent success appears to be a surge in social media activity. Social volume, a metric that tracks discussions and mentions on platforms like Twitter and Telegram, has skyrocketed by over 20% compared to the previous week. This suggests a growing interest in TON, potentially attracting new investors and driving up the price.\n📉 With #bearish sentiment high, #crypto markets have continued to slip over the past week. Overall, the market has dropped -3.6%, and volume is -27% lower than the previous week. $TON, $KAS, $RUNE, and $AKT have kept traders hopeful. https://t.co/E6b2DtmAxI pic.twitter.com/VoiCJk1ymh\n— Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 13, 2024\nHowever, a closer look reveals a potential wrinkle in this optimistic outlook. While the overall sentiment surrounding TON has been positive, it has recently dipped into negative territory. This could be a sign of growing investor apprehension, as some may be worried about the sustainability of the current price rally.\nOn the other hand, some metrics point towards potential long-term bullishness. The mean dollar invested age, an indicator of how long tokens have been held, has been gradually increasing. This suggests that investors are holding onto their TON, potentially with an eye on future gains.\nAdditionally, the dormant circulation, representing tokens that haven’t been moved in a while, has remained low. While a previous spike coincided with a price peak, the current stability could indicate a more strategic accumulation by investors.\nTechnical analysts, who study price charts and historical data to predict future movements, are also cautiously optimistic about TON. Fibonacci retracement levels, a popular technical tool, suggest the recent downtrend may be nearing its end. This could pave the way for TON to climb towards targets near $10, with potential profit-taking opportunities for investors.\nWhile the recent surge in price and social media buzz paints a promising picture for TON, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile.\nThe current uptrend for TON could be the beginning of a long-term ascent, fueled by growing adoption and a thriving ecosystem within the Telegram network. However, it’s also possible that this is just a short-lived rally, followed by a correction.\nFeatured image from Medjan, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

However, experts caution that this “pup-ularity” might be short-lived, fueled more by hype than by strong foundations.\nThe key indicator driving excitement is the skyrocketing Futures Open Interest for FLOKI. According to Coinglass, this figure, which reflects the number of outstanding futures contracts, has climbed a staggering 110% since May 1st, reaching a 30-day high of nearly $20 million. This suggests a surge of new market participants entering FLOKI positions, potentially anticipating further price increases.\nAdding fuel to the fire is the significant rise in FLOKI’s daily trading volume. On May 15th, Santiment reported a daily volume exceeding $1 billion, marking the highest level for FLOKI since late March. This intense buying activity indicates a surge in investor interest, pushing the price upwards.\nFurther bolstering the case for a bullish FLOKI is the behavior of its key momentum indicators. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Money Flow Index (MFI) currently sit comfortably above their neutral lines, at 62.68 and 65.37 respectively. In simpler terms, these metrics suggest that the price momentum leans towards further gains in the short term.\nAlso, the broader market sentiment surrounding FLOKI is notably positive. Increased trading volumes and a surge in social media mentions have amplified investor interest, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is gaining traction not just among retail traders but also institutional investors.\nRecent partnerships and strategic developments within the FLOKI ecosystem are likely to fuel further growth. These factors, combined with the strong technical indicators, paint a promising picture for FLOKI’s near-term performance, potentially paving the way for substantial price appreciation.\nHowever, beneath the shiny exterior lies a potential cause for concern. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), an indicator that measures the buying and selling pressure of an asset, paints a rather bearish picture.\nDespite the price appreciation, FLOKI’s CMF remains firmly in negative territory, currently hovering around -0.11. This suggests that even though the price is rising, the buying pressure might be weakening.\nThis divergence between price and buying pressure is often seen as a sign of a potential reversal, indicating a rally driven by short-term speculation rather than long-term investor confidence.\nWhile FLOKI’s recent performance is undeniably impressive, the underlying factors suggest a potentially volatile future. The surge in open interest and trading volume hints at a market frenzy, but the negative CMF raises concerns about the rally’s sustainability.\nFeatured image from Floki, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

Crypto Analyst Unveils 6-Month Prediction","content":" Crypto analysts continue to be super bullish on the future of the XRP price despite its poor performance in the past. However, while some analysts have predicted price targets that, to many, seem unrealistic, others have set more conservative targets. This is the case of crypto analyst Alan Santana, who just unveiled his 6-month prediction for the XRP price.\nAlan Santana took to the TradingView website to share his latest analysis on the XRP price. This prediction is expected to play out over the next six months as the crypto market heads into what is expected to be an explosive bull rally.\nThe crypto analyst believes that in this cycle, the altcoin may find its price moving well ahead of other altcoins. “it is likely to be one of the first to move… One of the first to move big!” the analyst said. Santana also gives reasons for this, one of them being that the waiting period between each bullish wave for the XRP price has elapsed.\nHis analysis showed that the altcoin has usually seen a 6-8-month gap between each bullish wave. However, it had been 308 days since it saw its last bullish wave, which is well over 10 months. This means that the altcoin is more than ready for another bullish wave. He also added, “The fact that XRPUSDT went through a correction and has been consolidating for this long is considered bullish.”\nFurthermore, the altcoin has been on a bullish trend, recording higher lows. This is usually bullish for any asset as it suggests better support for the price as it moves upward. “Higher lows means that the bulls have the upper hand when it comes to the long-term trajectory of this chart,” Santana explained.\nThe crypto analyst expects a rather rapid bullish wave for the XRP price and stated that he expects this to happen sometime in 2024 and 2025. The main reason behind this is that the accumulation phase for the altcoin is finally coming to an end.\nThis is a sentiment that has also been shared by another crypto analyst known as U-Copy. According to the analyst, the XRP price had been in accumulation for the last seven years, but it has finally come to an end in 2024, and this end in the accumulation phase will lead to a rally.\nWhile U-Copy expects the altcoin to hit a new all-time high price as this accumulation phase comes to an end, which would be an at least 600% move from here, Santana has taken a more conservative stance. The analyst does expect the XRP price to break above $1, but puts the peak around $1.9 and $2. This would mean a 280-300% move from here.\n“Once it starts going, it will go really strong and for a very long while… People will be wondering, ‘why didn’t I buy when prices were low?’,” the analyst concluded.\nScott Matherson is a prominent crypto writer at NewsBTC with a knack for capturing the pulse of the market, covering pivotal shifts, technological advancements, and regulatory changes with precision.

As of Friday afternoon, FIL is hovering around $5.80, but whispers of a $15 target in the coming weeks are swirling in the cryptosphere.\nFIL has been on a tear lately, defying the overall slump in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past 24 hours, the token saw an increase of over 7%, accompanied by a healthy trading volume exceeding $420 million. This surge in price and activity has grabbed the attention of market watchers, with many speculating on the possibility of a sustained upward trend.\nAdding fuel to the fire is crypto analyst World Of Charts, who has expressed a decidedly bullish sentiment on FIL’s future. According to their analysis, the recent price correction appears to be nearing its end.\n$Fil\nHealthy Correction Has Almost Over Seems Like #Fil Will Recover From Here Falling Wedge Breakout Has Already Confirmed Expecting Move Towards 15$ In Coming Weeks#Crypto #Filcoin pic.twitter.com/O61j9B02ha\n— World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) May 15, 2024\nThey point to a confirmed falling wedge breakout pattern, which historically indicates a potential trend reversal. This technical indicator suggests FIL could be poised for a significant rebound, with World Of Charts setting a target price of $15 in the coming weeks.\n\nFurther bolstering the bullish case is FIL’s defiance of the broader downward trend in the crypto market. While many digital assets have been experiencing significant price drops, FIL has managed to hold its ground. This resilience suggests strong underlying support and potential for future growth.\nTechnical analysis also paints a positive picture for FIL. The RSI (Relative Strength Index), a momentum indicator, is currently exhibiting a slow but steady upward trajectory. This suggests that FIL is not overbought and has room for further price appreciation.\nAdditionally, FIL has historically displayed a pattern of high trading volume at price peaks and low volume during price dips. This ongoing trend signifies strength in the token’s price action.\nHowever, the bullish outlook is not without its caveats. A breach below the crucial $5.50 support level could trigger negative sentiment and potentially lead to a price decline. This highlights the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, where unforeseen events can quickly alter price movements.\nFurthermore, market sentiment is highly sensitive to external factors such as regulatory news, macroeconomic trends, and technological developments within the crypto space.\nAny adverse developments, such as stringent regulatory crackdowns or security breaches, could exacerbate selling pressure and undermine investor confidence.\nFeatured image from Wallpapers.com, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

Additionally, #Chainlink is seeing its most #bullish sentiment in over a year. #FOMO staying low will help these rises continue. https://t.co/TcEPBdS9Oh pic.twitter.com/czvE1mOgId\n— Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 17, 2024\nSocial media platforms are now abuzz with enthusiastic discussions as Bitcoin enthusiasts express excitement about the cryptocurrency’s potential. Many are drawing parallels to the last major bull run in 2021, when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of over $68,000.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin community celebrates this latest achievement, seasoned analysts are urging investors to tread carefully and avoid the pitfalls of impulsive decision-making. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, and Bitcoin’s price history is filled with dramatic ups and downs.\nBitcoin’s recent resurgence also coincides with a broader upswing in traditional markets, raising questions about the extent to which the cryptocurrency’s performance is intertwined with the wider financial ecosystem. A potential downturn in the stock market, for example, could negatively impact Bitcoin’s momentum as investors shift their funds accordingly.\nAs Bitcoin’s price climbs, so too does the risk of FOMO – the fear of missing out. This psychological phenomenon can drive investors to make impulsive decisions, fearing they’ll miss out on significant gains.\nThe resurgence of Bitcoin has reinvigorated the cryptocurrency community, but seasoned investors know that the road ahead may not be smooth sailing. Extreme bullish sentiment can sometimes act as a contrarian indicator, suggesting that the market might be nearing a peak.\nMeanwhile, market volatility remains a constant concern, capable of triggering significant price swings at any moment. Moreover, regulatory scrutiny looms large, with governments worldwide grappling to establish frameworks that balance innovation with investor protection.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,096, down a measly 0.2% in the last 24 hours, but managed to sustain a 10.0% rally in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

After a period of consolidation, VET is experiencing a surge in investor confidence, buoyed by a recent price increase and positive technical indicators.\nHowever, analysts remain cautious, highlighting the inherent volatility of the crypto market and the need for a measured approach.\nSince the top altcoin has been trading sideways for more than a month, investors are turning to other potentially profitable cryptocurrencies. But, the last 24 hours have offered a different perspective that could potentially change the narrative in favor of VeChain.\nIn the last day, VET has defied the broader market malaise with a commendable 3% price increase. This resilience comes after encountering a crucial support level, indicating a potential reversal of its recent downtrend.\nCurrently, VET faces a critical test at the $0.04 resistance level. A successful breakout above this barrier could propel the price further upwards, while a rejection could lead to a pause or even a downturn.\nThe recent price action has triggered bullish signals from technical analysts. The breakout from a “Falling Wedge” pattern, a technical indicator suggesting a trend reversal, has instilled optimism.\nPopular crypto analyst World of Charts has set a lofty target price increase of 500% in the coming weeks.\n$Vet\nBouncing From Solid Support (Accumulation Zone Area) Successful Retest Can Lead Massive Bullish Wave In Coming Weeks Expecting 400-500% Bullish Wave#Crypto #Vet #Vechain pic.twitter.com/r2eryHNEDL\n— World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) May 16, 2024\nHowever, seasoned investors know that technical analysis is just one piece of the puzzle. The overall market sentiment and unforeseen events can significantly impact VET’s price trajectory.\n\nWhile the short-term price predictions paint a rosy picture, the true value of VET lies in its underlying technology. VeChain’s focus on supply chain solutions has attracted partnerships with major corporations like Walmart China and DNV GL.\nThese collaborations demonstrate the real-world applications of VeChain’s blockchain platform and its potential to disrupt traditional supply chain management practices. Increased adoption of VeChain’s technology by businesses could translate to long-term growth for the VET token, regardless of short-term price fluctuations.\nFor VeChain, the coming weeks will be a test of its technical strength and market confidence. A successful breakout above the $0.04 resistance level could usher in a period of sustained growth.\nBut regardless of the short-term price action, VeChain’s long-term potential hinges on its ability to deliver real-world value through its innovative blockchain solutions.\nFeatured image from PBR, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

With Bitcoin increasing to $66,000, experts believe several projects could see significant rallies over the next few weeks. Three projects that have already caught whale attention are Chainlink, Rollblock, and Binance Coin (BNB). With all projects already in the green, experts believe they could see significant rallies, with Rollblock poised for returns of over 720%.\nChainlink’s impressive performance has continued in Q2, taking the altcoin’s annual returns to 107%. This milestone has triggered an influx of new investors, and Chainlink’s daily trading volume is up by 25.95% over the last 24 hours.\nAt the time of writing, Chainlink was trading at $13.82 and boasted a market cap of $8.1 Billion. Since its launch in 2017, Chainlink has showcased exceptional growth, outperforming many of the market’s top cryptocurrencies.\nFollowing its recent rally, experts believe that Chainlink could pass $20 in 2024. As a result, crypto whales are doubling down on Chainlink (LINK) tokens to optimize their portfolios.\nBinance recently implemented an “antidote” to the growing problem of address poisoning. This is when an investor is tricked into sending funds to a fraudulent address. This new algorithm has already been a huge success and has identified over 13.4 million spoofed addresses. This is a huge boost to the Binance Coin ecosystem.\nGiven that crypto scams are on the rise, this development brings a much-needed sense of security to Binance Coin and the Binance Smart Chain. Since this update, Binance Coin’s price has increased by 2.29%, and Binance Coin (BNB) is now trading at $580.85.\nHaving already experienced a strong performance in 2024, experts believe that Binance Coin (BNB) could be one of the market’s top cryptos in May. But how does Binance Coin compare to Rollblock?\nRollblock is attracting cryptocurrency whales with its GambleFi protocol. This innovative project is one of the first to apply blockchain technology to the gambling industry, and its impact could be pivotal. By using blockchain technology, Rollblock is able to solve major industry issues such as transparency and security.\nRollblock has already launched its casino, which showcases over 150 different games. The platform is fully licensed and will also introduce sports betting options over the next few months. These will cover major sports, including MMA, golf, boxing, soccer, and the NFL.\nOne reason whales are buying Rollblock is its revenue share opportunity. Rollblock will share up to 30% of its daily revenue with $RBLK token holders. It will do this by using revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens on the open market, burning half of the tokens it buys. The remaining half will be used for staking rewards, offering some of the most lucrative passive income opportunities in the crypto market.\nThis could become a great way for investors to build passive income streams and has been a key factor in Rollblock’s rapid growth. Currently in stage 2 of its presale, investors can buy $RBLK tokens for just $0.012. Experts believe tokens could increase in value by 720% during the Rollblock presale, and as a result, tokens are in high demand.\nRollblock has a long-term roadmap in place, with big plans to pioneer developments in the gambling industry. With little competition, experts believe that Rollblock could quickly become one of the world’s top cryptocurrencies. With the price of RBLK expected to increase up to 880% in the presale alone, many investors are choosing to buy early to maximize their returns.\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!\nWebsite: https://presale.rollblock.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/rollblockcasino\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Over the past week, its price surged by nearly 8%, much to the delight of investors. However, a recent move by a large DOGE holder has cast a shadow of uncertainty on the future of this playful pup’s price trajectory.\nThe broader crypto market sentiment has been bullish recently, and DOGE has been happily wagging its tail along. The past week saw a significant price increase, and the good times seemed to be rolling with a 3% jump in the last 24 hours alone.\nThis pushed DOGE’s price to a cheerful $0.152, bringing smiles back to the faces of many investors who have been patiently waiting for a sustained climb.\nThe party wasn’t just limited to the spot market. The derivatives market also saw a notable rise in activity, with Dogecoin Futures open interest jumping a healthy 9%.\nThis suggests a renewed interest from traders, particularly those looking to capitalize on potential price movements through futures contracts.\nAdding fuel to the fire, short sellers have been feeling the heat lately. According to Coinglass, they’ve faced liquidations totaling a staggering $2.27 million.\nThis could potentially trigger a short squeeze, a scenario where short sellers are forced to buy back DOGE to cover their positions, and further push the price upwards. However, this positive development hinges on whether it can overpower the potential selling pressure arising from a recent whale movement.\nJust as things were looking bright for DOGE, a transaction involving a whale sent ripples of concern through the Dogecoin community. Data from Whale Alert revealed that a whopping 200 million DOGE, valued at around $30.86 million, was transferred to the trading platform Robinhood.\nThis hefty move has raised eyebrows, with many suspecting the whale might be preparing to cash out a significant portion of their holdings. A large sell-off could introduce significant selling pressure, potentially derailing DOGE’s current upward momentum.\nTaking a peek under the hood from a technical standpoint, DOGE appears to be attempting to break its daily downtrend. This is a positive sign for bulls, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. Further analysis reveals that DOGE recently entered an order block, which has been contributing to its ongoing price increase.\nFeatured image from War History Online, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

Such outstanding potential is drawing investors from all over the world, with rapidly changing times that have now come to an extraordinary turning point. Let’s dive deeper into BEFE’s fundamentals to learn more about the disrupting meme coin.\nMemecoins have burst into the cryptocurrency scene due to massive hype on social media and community interaction. Originally created as a joke, memecoins have scaled up to fame and value on things like viral trends and celebrity endorsements. This paves the way for new entrants, and BEFE enters that realm as one of the latest strong contenders in the domain of memecoins. BEFE Coin continues to rise in hype and has straightaway drawn unique appeal and some community backing. Notably, the BEFE project is more about combining humor with tangible utility than its predecessors at the meme coin; somewhat of its salient point in the usual meme coin narrative. Already BEFE is just getting its momentum and very quickly stirring the meme coin market, which for the most has been dominated by DOGE, SHIBA Inu, and PEPE coins.\nThis is the kind of potential exponential growth investors love, and this is an attraction similar to that in the early days of other successful meme coins. BEFE Coin is in its developing stage, heralds an opportunity to be the very first investors of a new trend. Being innovative, BEFE Coin is surely in the offing to experience the hyperdynamic world of meme coins.\nIn the past few days, the performance of BEFE in the market has been strong. It has succeeded in quite a number of instances to withstand some of the fluctuations in price, returning to the green. Most importantly, on May 18th, the BEFE price bloomed an impressive 10.8% to $0.00010776. The market cap also hit $10,151,451 in a high, signaling fast-growing interest by many in the market. BEFE has managed to trade above $0.00009000 for the better part of the month, meaning that BEFE has succeeded in gaining stability in the market. This is supported by the trading volume of BEFE, which has also been at a stable place, as it has stayed above $200,000 for most days. With many having witnessed the market being quite volatile, the ability of BEFE to remain resilient is, therefore, a sure suggestion of strong fundamentals and the confidence that investors have in this coin.\nAs we can see, BEFE really positions itself with a positive movement, earning the respect of investors as a very reliable and promising investment option in the memecoin space. But be careful, as the crypto space is rather volatile and unpredictable. Investors are encouraged to exercise caution and do extensive research before investing in BEFE or another similar crypto.\nTo know more about BEFE, Visit https://befetoken.com\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

What's next?","title":"Why Did Bitcoin Just Jump 10%? Blockchain Firm Weighs In","content":" The cryptocurrency market has been on a hot streak in the past few days, with several large-cap assets posting significant gains in the past week. Most notably, the Bitcoin price bounced back from around $61,000 to above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month.\nAs expected, this latest price movement has sparked a lot of speculation and discussion around the premier cryptocurrency. Popular blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has shared on-chain insights into the recent Bitcoin price rally and its future trajectory.\nIn a recent report, CryptoQuant revealed the catalyst and on-chain manifestations behind BTC’s latest rally to above $67,000. According to the analytics firm, the price of Bitcoin rode to its new highs on the back of the news of lower-than-expected inflation in the United States.\nThe inflation data released on Wednesday, May 15 showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in April – lower than the expected 0.4%. This revelation suggested that inflation might be on a downward slope in the US, making risky assets like Bitcoin more attractive.\n🧵 #Bitcoin's price has rallied from $60K to around $66K, driven by lower-than-expected US inflation and reduced selling pressure.\nLet's look into the details ⬇️\n— CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 17, 2024\n\nIn its report, CryptoQuant revealed that there has been a decreased selling pressure in the BTC market, as short-term holders are selling at low or negative profits. Meanwhile, Bitcoin balances at over-the-counter (OTC) desks have steadied, implying that fewer coins are entering the open market.\nWhat’s more, the analytics platform highlighted a particular on-chain signal that might have predicted the recent Bitcoin price rally. According to CryptoQuant, BTC miners have been extremely underpaid over the past few weeks, which often correlates with price bottoms.\nCryptoQuant, in its report, identified potential catalysts for a continued rally for the Bitcoin price. According to the on-chain data company, demand from permanent holders and largest investors is on the rise but it needs to climb rapidly to push the price of BTC even higher.\nFurthermore, the latest data shows that Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded funds) purchases have dwindled to nearly zero daily, while stablecoin liquidity growth is also on a decline. CryptoQuant noted that these two metrics need a jolt, which might be critical for a sustained Bitcoin rally.\nAs of this writing, the Bitcoin price continues to hover around $67,000, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is up by a significant 10% in the past week.\nOpeyemi is a proficient writer and enthusiast in the exciting and unique cryptocurrency realm. While the digital asset industry was not his first choice, he has remained absolutely drawn since making a foray into the space over two years. Now, Opeyemi takes pride in creating unique pieces unraveling the complexities of blockchain technology and sharing insights on the latest trends in the world of cryptocurrencies. Opeyemi savors his attraction to the crypto market, which explains why he spends the better parts of his day looking through different price charts. “Looking” is a rather simple way to describe analyzing and interpreting various price patterns and chart formations. However, it appears that is not Opeyemi’s favorite part - in fact, far from it. Being able to connect what happens on a price chart to on-chain movements and blockchain activities is what keeps Opeyemi ticking. “This emphasizes the intricacies of blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency market,” he would say. Most importantly, Opeyemi thinks of any market insights as the gospel, while recognizing that he is only a messenger. When he is not clicking away at his keyboard, Opeyemi is most definitely listening to music, playing games, reading a book, or scrolling through X. He likes to think he is not loyal to a particular genre of music, which can be true on many days. However, the fast-rising Afrobeats genre is a staple in Opeyemi’s Spotify Daily Mix. Meanwhile, Opeyemi is a voracious reader who enjoys a wide category of books - ranging from science fiction, fantasy, and historical, to even romance. He believes that authors like George R. R. Martin and J. K. Rowling are the greatest of all time when it comes to putting pen to paper. Opeyemi believes his reading of the Harry Potter series twice is proof of that. Indeed, Opeyemi enjoys spending most of his time within the four walls of his home. However, he also sometimes finds solace in the company of his friends at a bar, a restaurant, or even on a stroll. In essence, Opeyemi’s ambivert (haha! been searching for an opportunity to use the word to describe myself) nature makes him a social chameleon who is able to quickly adapt to different settings. Opeyemi recognizes the need to constantly develop oneself in order to stay afloat in a competitive and ever-evolving market like crypto. For this reason, he is always in learning mode, ready to pick up the slightest lesson from every situation.

After a brutal price correction last week, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has staged a mini-rebound, leaving investors wondering if this is the start of a sustained bull run or a fleeting flicker before another dip.\nEthereum (ETH) surged 3.7% in the last 24 hours, buoyed by a general uptick in the crypto market. This positive movement comes after a significant price drop that saw ETH fall to $2,850. The recent rise has sparked optimism among some analysts, with popular crypto figure Ali calling for a potential “one to four candlestick rebound” based on a buy signal he identified on ETH’s chart.\nThe TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the #Ethereum daily chart! It anticipates that $ETH could see a rebound of one to four candlesticks. pic.twitter.com/Vg7FTl9X2a\n— Ali (@ali_charts) May 15, 2024\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced. A closer look at on-chain data reveals some conflicting signals. CryptoQuant’s data shows a sharp rise in ETH’s exchange reserves over the past few days, suggesting that investors might be offloading their holdings rather than accumulating.\nThis is further supported by Santiment’s data, which indicates an increase in ETH’s supply on exchanges over the past week.\n\nThe behavior of large investors, often referred to as “whales,” also paints an unclear picture. While Ethereum’s supply held by top addresses remained flat, suggesting whales haven’t made any significant moves, this could be interpreted in two ways.\nSome believe it indicates a wait-and-see approach from whales, anticipating a potential market top before re-entering.\nDespite the mixed signals, some metrics point towards a potential price increase for ETH. The token’s Network To Value (NVT) ratio, as analyzed by Glassnode, has declined significantly over the past week.\nMeanwhile, adding another layer of complexity to the prediction puzzle is the current market sentiment surrounding ETH. While some analysts are turning bullish, evidenced by the rise in ETH’s weighted sentiment on social media platforms, technical indicators paint a less clear picture.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) have both dipped recently, potentially suggesting a loss of momentum in the recent upswing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, however, has presented a bullish crossover, hinting at a potential continuation of the uptrend.\nWhile the recent price increase and some on-chain metrics suggest a potential bull run for Ethereum, the conflicting signals from exchange reserves, whale behavior, and technical indicators make it difficult to predict with certainty.\nFeatured image from Popular Mechanics, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.

More specifically in Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), Sealana ($SEAL), and WienerAI ($WAI) projects.\nLet’s check out the details.\n>>> Buy Best Meme Coin Now <<<\nThe forefront of the market has long been occupied by BNB, thanks to its close ties with Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It used to be seen as one of the most stable coins, with minimal price fluctuations.\nHowever, recent times have seen a significant shift. Binance Coin experienced substantial drops over the past week, plummeting well below the $600 mark. One contributing factor to this sudden downturn is the recent series of major crypto-related arrests.\nOntario’s ‘’Crypto King’’, Aiden Pleterski, was arrested on fraud charges following an 18-month investigation. Authorities found evidence of money laundering using investor funds.\nSimilarly, two US citizens were apprehended for a lightning-fast theft totaling over $25 million. The brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, aided by corrupt IRS agents, allegedly\nengaged in money fraud and wire laundering. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison.\nDespite these setbacks, there are still profit opportunities, especially in the booming meme coin market.\nAnalysts are pointing to new presales as the next big thing, with tokens like Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sealana ($SEAL) showing potential for x100 returns.\nLet’s see the details of each token below.\n>>> Buy Best Meme Coin Now <<<\nDogeverse ($DOGEVERSE) stands out as the pioneer in multi-blockchain functionality among coins. Its groundbreaking technology seamlessly integrates across 6 major blockchains, a feat never seen before in the crypto realm.\nInspired by the successful models of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Dogeverse adopts the beloved dog avatar concept, featuring a quirky space doge navigating the vast crypto landscapes. This character symbolizes the freedom and agility within the crypto space, effortlessly moving between blockchains.\n\nThe presale phase of Dogeverse witnessed unprecedented success, raking in millions shortly after its ICO launch in April. As of now, the project has amassed over $15 million and is rapidly approaching its hard cap of $17 million, signaling the high demand and investor interest.\nOne of Dogeverse’s strengths is its strong community support, boasting nearly 20,000 followers on X. This massive following is not surprising, given that 25% of the total 200 billion tokens are dedicated to marketing, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement.\nInvestors opting to stake $DOGEVERSE tokens can enjoy various rewards and benefits, with annual percentage yields reaching up to 72%\nCurrently priced at $0.00031 per coin, buying $DOGEVERSE tokens at this stage presents a favorable opportunity, especially considering the anticipated exponential surge in price post-listing.\n>>> Buy Dogeverse Now <<<\nSealana ($SEAL) is a plump seal diving deep into the Solana Sea’s mysteries. He’s glued to his PC, growing larger by the day, fueled by chips and canned tuna. His obsession? Finding the best Solana meme coins, keeping his flippers busy.\nInspired by South Park’s World of Warcraft episode, Sealana is the newest SOL meme coin with a ‘Send to Wallet’ presale. Rumor has it that it’s from the same creators behind the viral\nSLERF token that blew up in March 2024.\n\nTo get $SEAL, you can use the website widget or send SOL directly to the presale wallet. After the presale, you’ll get token airdrops. Right now, $SEAL is a steal at $0.022, but prices will rise during the presale. It’s smart to get in early.\nAnd if you’re sending tokens to Sealana’s wallet, use a DEX wallet to qualify for the airdrop.\nBut what really sets Sealana apart is its community. Unlike other projects, $SEAL fans are active and engaged, sharing memes and insights. This lively atmosphere makes Sealana more than just a meme coin—it’s a community-driven adventure in the crypto world.\nIn short, Sealana isn’t just riding the hype; it’s a symbol of community, innovation, and a bit of seal spirit. Whether you’re a crypto pro or just curious, consider joining Sealana’s journey and see where it takes you in the Solana Sea.\n>>> Buy Sealana Now <<<\nWienerAI ($WAI) emerges as the next-gen doge-themed token, integrating cutting-edge AI technology into its framework.\nCurrently, in its presale phase, WienerAI is set to undergo multiple stages. In the ongoing phase, investors can acquire 1 $WAI for $0.000707. This phase is swiftly approaching\nits conclusion, having already raised close to $2 million within just a month.\nWith only $150,000 remaining to bridge the gap, the next phase promises significant price escalations.\n\nStaking is a pivotal aspect of WienerAI, offering generous rewards for token holders. While it’s expected that APYs will decrease as more users adopt the token, early investors stand to benefit from this advantageous opportunity.\nDown the road, WienerAI plans to integrate an AI bot into its platform, enhancing trade predictions and overall functionality. This forward-looking approach adds another layer of appeal for potential investors interested in the project’s long-term vision and innovation.\n>>> Buy Wiener AI Now <<<\nThe recent market dip of the famous Binance coin has left investors feeling uneasy about their future finances.\nHowever, many experts are optimistic that there are still big profits to be made, more notably in the meme coin market.\nIf you want to jump on the opportunity early, top analysts recommend considering investments in Dogeverse ($DOGEVERSE), WienerAI ($WAI), and Sealana ($SEAL).\nGrab these tokens before prices skyrocket after the presale ends. Being among the first to invest could lead to significant gains as these tokens will surely gain traction in the market.\n\nDisclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

{"url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/4-key-reasons-bitcoin-bull-run-far-from-over/","web_url":"https://www.newsbtc.com/","type":"article","description":"Analyst@tedtalksmacro provides compelling evidence to support his assertion that the current Bitcoin bull run is far from over.","title":"4 Key Reasons Why The Bitcoin Bull Run Is Far From Over","content":" In an analysis shared via X, renowned crypto analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) has provided compelling evidence to support his assertion that the current Bitcoin bull run is far from over. Ted’s insights are based on four critical indicators related to traditional finance and crypto liquidity, each pointing to sustained growth in the near future. Here’s a breakdown of his analysis:\nTed highlights the 65-month liquidity cycle, a historical pattern that marks the ebb and flow of liquidity in financial markets. According to his analysis, this cycle bottomed out in October 2023, signaling the beginning of a new expansion phase.\n“We are now in the expansion phase, which is expected to peak in 2026,” Ted stated. This projection aligns with the anticipated easing by central banks in response to slowing economic data over the next 18 to 24 months. Historically, increased liquidity has been a precursor to bull markets in various asset classes, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem.\nThe M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, is another crucial indicator, if not the most important indicator of global liquidity. Ted notes that the rate of expansion in the M2 money supply is at its lowest since the 1990s.\n“There is plenty of room to the upside for easing liquidity conditions,” he explained. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies to stimulate economies, increased M2 growth could lead to more capital flowing into risk assets like Bitcoin.\nWhile liquidity has returned to the crypto markets, particularly with the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ted points out that the velocity of inflows has not yet reached the levels seen at cycle tops. “The velocity of inflow has not yet seen a manic phase consistent with cycle tops,” he noted.\nThis suggests that while interest and investment in Bitcoin are growing, the market has not yet reached the speculative frenzy that typically precedes a major correction. This phase of measured inflow can provide a more stable foundation for continued price increases.\nThe US based spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows, with last week alone witnessing $950 million flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the largest net inflow since March. Ted expects these inflows to increase as Bitcoin’s price rises and traditional finance investors regain confidence in the asset.\n“Expect these to only increase as price drifts higher and tradFi once again renew faith in the asset,” he stated. The growing acceptance and investment from institutional investors via ETFs are a strong bullish indicator for Bitcoin’s continued ascent.\nEach of these factors points to a sustained and robust bull market for Bitcoin. Ted’s analysis, grounded in traditional financial indicators and crypto-specific data, provides a comprehensive outlook on the current and future state of the Bitcoin market. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies and institutional interest continues to grow, the conditions appear ripe for Bitcoin’s bull run to extend well into the coming years.\nAt press time, BTC traded at $66,602.\nJake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

While online chatter paints a picture of a vibrant community, the token’s value treads water, leaving investors to question whether the buzz translates to bullish momentum.\nA recent tweet by Santiment, a crypto market intelligence platform, highlighted a surge in XRP-related discussions. This increased chatter could be linked to the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent stance on Ripple Labs’ upcoming stablecoin, which the SEC considers an “unregistered crypto asset.”\n🗣️ #Monero is being discussed at an abnormally high rate due to the announcement that #LocalMonero is sunsetting as governments continue cracking down on $XMR and other privacy focused assets.\n🗣️#XRPLedger is also seeing a high rate of discussion due to $XRP price volatility,… pic.twitter.com/gaV3ywP2up\n— Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 9, 2024\nWhile the regulatory heat may have sparked conversation, it hasn’t translated to a price surge. In fact, XRP’s value dipped slightly in the past 24 hours.\nInterestingly, despite the lackluster price action, data from Santiment suggests investors might be accumulating XRP. The platform’s “Exchange Outflow” metric remains high, indicating a movement of XRP away from exchanges, possibly towards private wallets. This suggests a potential long-term bullish sentiment among some investors.\nHowever, not all signs are positive. Popular crypto analyst Cryptoes noted on Twitter that XRP’s price is precariously perched right below its 21-day moving average, a technical indicator often interpreted as a bearish signal.\n\nIf the bearish signals hold true, XRP could plummet to its support level near $0.50. A break below this crucial point might trigger a further cascade, dragging the price down to $0.47. This potential decline aligns with another concerning trend – XRP’s Network Growth.\nAccording to Santiment, the number of new addresses created for XRP transfers has been declining over the past month. This could indicate a shrinking user base, raising questions about XRP’s long-term adoption.\nThe current situation surrounding XRP is an enigma. On the one hand, the social media buzz and investor accumulation paint a picture of a project with dedicated followers. On the other hand, the technical indicators and declining network growth raise concerns about the token’s immediate future.\nFeatured image from Peapix, chart from TradingView\nChristian is a journalist, editor and a former layout design consultant.
