With that in mind, it’s a","title":"4 Things We’ve Learned About Owning Bitcoin in 2023","content":["For some people, the word bitcoin still triggers an eye-roll, but by now, most of us know that cryptocurrency is here to stay. With that in mind, it’s a good idea to make sure you’re clued up and well-educated on the topic, especially if you’ve ever considered investing yourself.","However, with so much misinformation floating around on the world wide web, it’s easy to assume that steering clear is safest, or to get overwhelmed with how to approach the process. If you’ve been having a bit of an internal battle over the ins and outs of crypto, here are some of the most important things we’ve learned about it over the years.","1. Education is Key","No matter what the nay-sayers might suggest, there’s nothing inherently dangerous or even risky about investing in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. However, it is absolutely crucial that you get educated before committing to it – because uninformed decisions are what lead to disaster in any type of investing move.","There is an abundance of information available online. Look to professionals in the industry, and consult the Crypto 101 video series to help you understand the basics. You can even pay for professional consultants to help you in your journey if you want to be more assured you’re making good choices.","2. You Need a Secure Wallet","Choosing your crypto wallet is a bigger deal than you might think. Your wallet is your portal into the crypto world, and so picking something secure and reliable is important for a myriad of reasons.","An all-in-one wallet like Noones is one of the best options out there because the process becomes incredibly simplified. However, there are countless options on the market. What matters is that you do your research and pick a wallet that aligns with your needs, offers security, and has good user reviews. The voice of the people is always something to pay attention to, and if multiple people have had a negative experience, it’s a good sign to steer clear.","3. Scams and Phishing Are Real Problems","Even though more and more people are wising up, there are some common crypto scams that are still alive and well in 2023, and it’s essential that you’re aware of them and know how to protect yourself.","Make sure you know about the potential risks, and avoid ever sharing private keys or personal information with anyone – especially over text or online messaging. You should be able to identify the warning signs, but when it comes to your finances online, it’s best to be extra vigilant.","4. Diversifying is Smart","Any serious investors will tell you how important it is to diversify your portfolio, and having a well-balanced crypto portfolio is just as important as balancing your stock investments.","A crucial part of this is maintaining the balance between your crypto portfolio and overall investment portfolio. However, you’ll also want to ensure that your crypto portfolio itself contains a few different types of cryptocurrency with different risk levels."],"create_date":"2023-11-13T10:10:08+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

Unsurprisingly, Shiba Inu is among the top gainers, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) price pumping by an astonishing 335% over the last 30 days. BlockDAG (BDAG) and Raffle Coin (RAFF) are stealing the show in the presale market. Keep reading for a closer look at these developments and discover which one of these coins could be the golden ticket in the next crypto bull run of 2024.","The Raffle Coin (RAFF) project aims to address the absence of a unified decentralised platform for raffles, lotteries, and giveaways. It introduces a privacy-centric, decentralised hub where users can load their accounts with supported cryptos and join in various prize draws, ranging from crypto to cars and lux holiday packages.","","Apart from its unique value proposition, the Raffle Coin (RAFF) presale draws investors’ attention with permanent liquidity locking, a 2-year freeze on team-held coins, and successful audit completion.","On March 1, 3.75 million of SHIB were intentionally removed from the SHIB supply. This destruction, part of a ” burning process,” left around 581.65 trillion SHIB coins available for circulation.","As a result of this massive reduction in SHIB supply, SHIB’s rally gained enormous momentum, up by 281% over the last seven days and by 335% over the previous month. Another key factor propelling the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is the generally bullish sentiment spurred by the anticipation of the Bitcoin halving.","","BlockDAG (BDAG), an emerging PoW project that builds on the Kaspa protocol, has quickly caught the attention of early investors, having already raised over $2.6 million despite being only in the second batch of its presale.","BlockDAG’s unique value proposition includes a series of mining rigs designed to use minimum power while maintaining high efficiency. They come in four types: X1, X10, X30, and X100, each with increasing mining power.","The X1 is a simple app for your phone that lets you mine up to 20 BDAG coins daily without draining your battery. The X10 model ups the ante, allowing you to mine up to 200 BDAG a day. If you aim higher, the X30 can get you 600 BDAG daily, and the top-tier X100 model can pull in a whopping 2,000 BDAG daily. With over 3,100 units already sold, BlockDAG’s mining solutions demand is already evident.","BlockDAG is currently in its second presale batch, priced at just $0.0015 per BDAG. The project plans to release 45 presale batches, with the price slated to reach $0.05 by the final batch.","","In response to the overwhelming early investor interest and the $2M raised quickly, BlockDAG has announced a $2 million mega giveaway shared by 50 lucky community members. To participate in the giveaway, follow BlockDAG’s social media channels, submit your wallet address, increase your chances by completing all quests, and bring friends for additional entries!","Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has surged by 335% over the past month, yet a potential decline looms as Bitcoin nears consolidation. BlockDAG (BDAG) and Raffle Coin (RAFF) are stealing the limelight among presales. Of particular note is the BlockDAG project, which has already raised over $2.6 and sold over 3100 of its mining units. As the price is slated to increase with each subsequent presale batch, with 45 batches in total, the opportune time to invest in BlockDAG is now, while the project is still early in its presale.","","Invest In BlockDAG Today"],"create_date":"2024-03-06T01:06:28+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

With 10 strategically located crypto ATM hotspots spanning central Athens and the northern suburbs, Bcash enables instant access to leading cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and USDT.","Experience the Leading Greek Crypto ATM Network at Bcash’s Hotspots","From first-hand experience, I’m impressed by Bcash’s easy user interface, excellent customer assistance, and fair prices. Their two-way ATM machines allow both buying with Euro cash and selling crypto for instant fiat payouts. I found the simple on-screen instructions enabled completing transactions in under 2 minutes!","Bcash’s Bitcoin ATM network stands out from competitors by aligning prices closely with real-time crypto market rates. Their typical 6-8% fees are much cheaper than traditional crypto brokers and exchanges in Greece. For investors seeking reliable local crypto access, Bcash has the solutions.","Central Athens Bcash Shops Offer Prime Buying and Selling","For maximum security while buying or selling Bitcoin, Bcash’s dedicated Athens shop locations are ideal. Their main office on Dimitrakopoulou Street in the city center contains a premier crypto ATM location open 6 days weekly. It’s close to public transit for easy access.","I also frequented Bcash’s Glyfada branch in the south shopping district. With spacious storefront access and long business hours, this hotspot proved one of my favorite crypto transaction destinations. The expert staff helped guide my buying process as a beginner too.","Glyfada Shopping District ATM Location","","The Glyfada store sits right on Gennimata Street, providing a safe and high-traffic venue for easily buying and selling leading cryptocurrencies. Open Monday through Saturday, this major Bcash outlet enjoys strong local area visibility for crypto investors.","Northern Suburbs ATM Hotspots","In Athens’ northern suburbs, I purchased Bitcoin multiple times at Bcash’s Nea Erythraia shop off Mikras Asias Street. Located just 20 minutes from the city center, it makes crypto conveniently accessible for residents across northeast Athens.","","Piraeus Port Shopping District ATM","","While recently docking overnight at the Piraeus cruise port as part of an Aegean island-hopping vacation, I encountered one of Bcash’s handy crypto ATMs just 5 minutes from the passenger terminals. Located right on Sachtouri Street inside the company’s Piraeus store, this machine proved hugely convenient for buying Bitcoin during my stay.","As one of Europe’s largest passenger ports, Piraeus receives over 4 million travelers every year who could benefit from easy access to crypto. Whether before boarding ferries to venture deeper into the Greek islands or arriving back onshore in Athens, the Bcash outlet enables obtaining coins to capture optimal valuations.","And for tourists exploring downtown Piraeus’ vast harborfront retail area, having a trusted Bitcoin ATM one block away gives peace of mind. Rather than relying solely on airport kiosks, cruise ship visitors can turn Euros into crypto almost anytime thanks to Bcash’s strategic positioning. As vacationing investors, that accessibility offers real advantages.","Bcash Brings Bitcoin to the Greek Islands","Rhodes Island BTM Location","While vacationing on the Greek island of Rhodes last summer, I was thrilled to discover a prime Bcash crypto ATM inside a jewelry shop right on central Averof Street. Open 6 days weekly, this machine enabled me to quickly buy BTC and ETH to capture temporary price dips, demonstrating Bcash’s impressive nationwide network.","Crete Island Bitcoin Access","Heraklion City Center Shop","","When visiting Heraklion on Crete Island, Bcash provided a welcoming retail outlet right on Kalokairinou Street near the central market to handle all my crypto transactions. With long weekday hours plus Saturday access, I could conveniently buy/sell between touring the island’s gorgeous beaches and historic sites!","How Bcash is Making Crypto User-Friendly in Greece","As a blockchain analyst who has helped many first-time crypto investors in Greece, I appreciate how Bcash excels at a smooth and understandable Bitcoin purchasing process. Their commitment to beginner education and support makes cryptocurrency less intimidating. Bcash also focuses on fair pricing and fees compared to traditional finance players.","Beginner-Friendly ATM Machines and Process","I often recommend Bcash’s Bitcoin ATMs for new Greek investors since their interface proving easy to follow self-guided steps. The on-screen prompts clearly cover scanning wallet QR codes, inserting cash bills, and confirming the crypto transfer. Bcash also guides new buyers in creating a digital currency account on their website before visiting the ATM.","Excellent Customer Support for Smooth Purchasing","Especially for crypto beginners, Bcash provides exceptional customer assistance to alleviate concerns over using Bitcoin ATMs or navigating wallet transfers. Their support team is available for live chat, phone, email, and even Telegram. I relied on them many times when learning to purchase BTC and ETH across their Greek ATM network.","Competitive Exchange Rates and Fees","From comparing Bcash’s crypto prices to other Athens-based brokerages and exchanges, I confirmed Bcash aims to offer fair market rates with typical fees under 10%. Far below the fees charged at Greek banks and trading platforms, Bcash passing savings to investors provides good value. This competitive pricing approach increases Bitcoin’s accessibility.","By focusing on convenience, education, support, and reasonable costs, Bcash succeeds at making cryptocurrencies understandable and approachable across Greece. Their extensive Bitcoin ATM network combined with helpful guidance lowers barriers for curious first-time buyers. Bcash makes exploring digital currency investing easy.","The Future of Crypto Acceptance in Greece","As a crypto analyst closely following blockchain innovation in Southeastern Europe, I see enormous growth potential for cryptocurrency usage across Greece. Bitcoin ATM platforms like Bcash have successfully built consumer awareness and understanding of digital coins over the past few years. Greece now counts over 50 Bitcoin ATM locations across Athens, Thessaloniki, popular tourist destinations, and more.","And the improved regulatory environment enables further mainstream crypto acceptance. Greece’s 2020 legislation aligned local digital asset rules with the European Union’s anti-money laundering directives. This risk reduction paved the way for more Greeks to comfortably explore decentralized finance through accessible solutions from Bcash.","On the merchant side, point-of-sale tools and business incentives for accepting payments in Bitcoin or Ethereum have also increased. As more customers request to transact or settle bills via cryptocurrency, I expect small Greek retailers, vendors, professionals to welcome crypto over the coming decade.","Between the expanding crypto ATM infrastructure, informed investors through Bcash’s educational initiatives, updated regulations, and motivated sellers, Greece appears poised to become one of Europe’s leading environments to utilize secure, frictionless cryptocurrency apps by 2030. The foundations support 10%+ of Greek financial flows leveraging blockchain within 10 years.",""],"create_date":"2024-03-03T18:18:46+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

Or that a loan company helps businesses with crypto. After","title":"Cryptocurrency Payments for Insurance: Are Insurance Companies Really Embracing Bitcoin and Altcoins?","content":["It is no longer unusual to hear that a bank accepts savings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the like. Or that a loan company helps businesses with crypto. After all, the traditional financial and insurance industries were among the first to adopt cryptocurrencies. The latter ones have found more than one way to incorporate these means of payment into their business. This approach proved useful not only for companies but also for policyholders.","The above claim was confirmed by several recent surveys, including that of Goldman Sachs, which showed that 6% of respondents (over 300 financial executives in the insurance sector) verified that their companies invest in crypto.","Several things make cryptocurrencies attractive, not only for insurance companies but also for policyholders. Some of them are beneficial to both parties, and some are specific.","So, when it comes to policyholders, they can expect several advantages of using crypto. One of the most notable is the opportunity for diversification. Thanks to crypto, they can get another asset (on top of the traditional ones) to add to their diversification strategy. By doing this, they can spread risk and keep their funds protected.","Also, policyholders can count on speedy transactions because crypto transactions are usually processed much faster than wire transfers. Receiving claim payouts on time in urgent situations is possible thanks to cryptocurrency.","We should also note that they get more privacy because they can stay pseudonymous.","On the other hand, insurance companies benefit from reduced transaction costs, faster settlements, improved security, and a few other things.","It’s one thing to discuss things in theory and another to see how they work in real life. Fortunately, there are many successful examples of insurance companies accepting crypto as a payment plan.","","INGUARD is one of the leading digital insurance companies based in the U.S. It provides its services in all 50 U.S. States. What makes INGUARD truly special is that they were the first insurance companies in North America to accept Bitcoin payments in 2013.","Interestingly, this brand is partnered with numerous tech companies who share their vision for insurance, including Fitbit and Michelin.","Some insurance companies rely on the blockchain. Lemonade is an excellent example of this. This brand throws blockchain technology and artificial intelligence into the mix or provides pet, car, home, and other types of insurance. It goes without saying that policyholders can use cryptocurrency as a payment plan.","","Compiling a list of insurance companies accepting crypto without mentioning AXA would be a mistake. This insurance provider comes from Switzerland. It was the first insurer in Switzerland (and among the first in Europe) to enable its customers to pay bills with Bitcoin. This move didn’t come as too much of a surprise, as their Hong Kong subsidiary was one of the first to enter the gaming virtual world by partnering up with The Sandbox metaverse developer, meaning the crypto-progressive incline was already there.","It’s worth noting that AXA works with Bitcoin Suisse (a cryptocurrency exchange) and Inapay (a mobile Bitcoin payment processor for mobile devices) to process the payments.","Next on the list, we have Metromile. This auto insurer was established in 2011 in California as a tech startup. Today, more than 100,000 drivers use Metromile for pay-per-mile car insurance, and many use cryptocurrency to pay for this. The good news is that policyholders can pay for various insurance premiums in Bitcoin and use it to claim payouts.","From Massachusetts comes Premier Shield Insurance, an insurance agency focused on several sectors. From auto insurance and identity theft insurance to home insurance and various types of business insurance options – this company has its clients covered. The best part is that they can use crypto to cover agency fees and pay insurance premiums.","There’s a limit for paying in crypto set at $5,000. Also, another downside is that you can’t claim payouts in Bitcoin.","Even though finding data on cryptocurrency and its use in the insurance sector is somewhat challenging, a thorough analysis will show you that these two are becoming closer than ever.","This makes sense because the use of cryptocurrency is growing. Dozens of countries across the globe have legalized this means of payment, and two of them have made it an official legal tender.","According to some market analysis, we should expect tremendous growth in the next few years. For instance, if the blockchain (crypto payments included) in the insurance market size was around 208 million dollars in 2020, it should reach 2.5 billion dollars by 2028, which is almost a tenfold rise."],"create_date":"2023-11-20T07:07:04+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

The best bitcoin tumblers for 2020 are here.","⦁ MyCryptoMixer.com (our recommendation)","As the name suggests, MyCryptoMixer stood out among its peers as the “People’s Choice”, emphasizing on the user’s experience from start to finish. One for the Bitcoin users, it provides non-custodial mixing of BTC with full anonymity. The responsive CS support and 24-hour log deletion have added to its credibility as the best privacy-focused mixer designed for everyone. Users’ funds are processed with a high-quality BTC pool, and an affordable variable service fee ranging from 0.5% – 5%, depending on the user’s preference. A simple 4-step mixing process allows the user to complete the mixing process in a matter of minutes. MyCryptoMixer supports TOR-based mixing, which will further diminish the ability for blockchain analytics to profile BTC users, making the transaction untraceable. Not forgetting the fact that users do not require any account registration. Users can select up to five destination wallet addresses and customize the time delay for each wallet. A letter of guarantee is also provided.","We’re not going to waste your time. You’re looking for the best bitcoin tumblers for this year? Look no further. Bitcoin Tumblers have always been misunderstood, but a valuable asset. According to Best Bitcoin Tumbler, a top website that gives up-to-date information about this matter, bitcoin tumblers and bitcoin mixers can help all traders improve their position in the market, so why not meet the best bitcoin tumblers for the new year?","⦁ BitBlender Despite the fact that they have high transaction fees (1-3%) and a lofty minimum deposit (0.01BTC), not to mention the fact that they have no zero log policy and no letter of guarantee, BitBlender is still one of the top services used by bitcoin owners. This is largely because they’ve been around since the dawn of time and have a high-quality stash to mix with. Also- there’s zero registration and users can select up to TEN different output addresses, which really makes their service stand out.","⦁ Blender.io Bender.io offers a variable transaction fee of 0.5-2.5% with a minimum deposit of 0.001BTC. They require a minimum of 3 confirmations and have a strict zero-logs policy. Blender.io also offers a letter of guarantee stating that your coins are piping fresh. Zero registration and a high degree of user controls are favorites among users and they can support up to 8 output addresses.","⦁ CryptoMixer Yet another dinosaur that only accepts bitcoin, CryptoMixer has that tried and true OG status. Variable fees from 0.5- 3% with a minimum deposit of 0.001BTC may dissuade newcomers, but they support up to 10 output addresses and have a zero logs policy. For more incentives, the company tosses up a referral program for returning users and has a letter of guarantee.","⦁ Anonymix A name that always seems to pop up in the top of any bitcoin tumblers list, Anonymix is a massive favorite. Simple to use, 0.3% transaction fee and a lowly 0.002BTC minimum deposit. Their minimum deposit threshold makes it really easy to give their services a try and find out for yourself. They offer a minimum of 1 confirmation and have both TOR and clear web services. They carry no logs and have a user-controlled time delay function.","⦁ Mixtum Staunch and pricey, Mixtum refers to itself as a “premium bitcoin mixer”. While one might assume that because of the astronomical 4-5% transaction fee, or rather dear 0.001BTC minimum deposit, their bougie tag line actually comes from their level of anonymity. With little to no user control, the site requires that users use at least two output addresses and multiple confirmations. Their process generally takes about 6 hours, but the anonymity of the tumbled coins are second to none.","⦁ Bitcloak Brand new to the bitcoin tumbler block, bitcloak is all about ease. They sport a 2% transaction fee with a 0.0004BTC network fee. The company requires a minimum deposit of 0.01BTC, supports up to 10 addresses and requires at least one confirmation. There’s a letter of guarantee as well. You can peek in on your mix during its progress and every bit of information about your mix is deleted within 24 hours.","⦁ PrivCoin PrivCoin supports a wealth of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and bitcoin cash. They have a low fixed transaction rate of 0.5% and tack on a 0.0005BTC fee for additional addresses, up to 10. They require anywhere from 1 to 50 confirmations and have a zero logs policy. There’s also a referral program and a letter of guarantee.","⦁ SmartMixer Variable transaction rate at 1-5%. They have no minimum deposit, but the transaction rates are fairly steep. Must have a minimum of three confirmations and SmartMixer holds logs for 24 hours, after which they automatically delete. They offer both TOR and clear web mixers for those that are uncomfortable with dark web browsers. Arguably a good mixer, but not designed for the pros.","⦁ ChipMixer ChipMixer is truly a stand-alone bitcoin tumbler. They have a minimum deposit of 0.001BTC, but pretty much everything after that is user-controlled. Transaction fees are mostly donation, unlimited output addresses and a zero logs policy. They also offer a letter of guarantee. With super high anonymity and a long list of user controls, ChipMixer is bound to quickly be embraced as the best.","⦁ Bitcoin Laundry A relatively new name in bitcoin blenders, they are quickly gaining “best” status. Their only fees are a 0.0002BTC fee per output address, no transaction fees are incurred. A super-low minimum deposit of 0.0005BTC and have a minimum confirmation requirement of 1. They also operate on both TOR and clear web- which is quickly becoming the norm. There is a user-controlled time delay function as well. However, the company does retain logs for a week after mixing, which can be a massive turn-off for many potential customers."],"create_date":"2020-02-18T07:07:01+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

Additionally, DeFi is now drawing in significant sums in venture capital.","Although virtually every new initiative claims to be offering something different, the majority of DeFi’s growth has been driven by two main segments – lending pools and decentralized exchanges (DEX). The latter has undergone several iterations over the years, but the embedded model is broadly based on the ideas pioneered by exchanges such as Uniswap and Bancor.","What exactly is a DEX?","In a nutshell, a DEX connects sellers and buyers and automatically calculates exchange rates and fees based on supply and demand. Rather than buyers and sellers being matched through an order book like on a centralized exchange, smart contracts perform all trades. DEXs like Uniswap typically operate by means of liquidity pools comprising a pair of tokens. Such a liquidity pool might contain Bitcoin (BTC) and a US-dollar stablecoin like Tether (USDT), for example.","In return for providing liquidity to the pool by “locking in” assets, users often referred to as “yield farmers” earn a share of the transaction fees paid by traders who use it to swap tokens. Yields adjust according to the relative scarcity of assets in the pool. Returning to the previous pair, for instance, if the volume of USDT were running low, the yield would automatically increase to incentivize users to provide more liquidity. The goal is to create a decentralized and automated trading system. Other exchanges like Balancer operate multi-token pools, whereas Curve Finance focuses on stablecoin arbitrage.","While much of the growth in DEX usage has been driven by the retail segment, there is increasing evidence of institutional interest in the space, according to a recent report from Chainalysis. However, DEXs are a very different proposition from their centralized counterparts and come with a unique set of opportunities and challenges for institutional players.","The advantages of DEXs over centralized exchanges","Firstly, their open and permissionless nature means that DEXs can list an extraordinarily large array of tokens, as anyone can launch their own liquidity pools. At one point in 2020, Coindesk reported that Uniswap had added over a thousand new token pairs in a single week. Therefore, DEXs give early investors the ability to start trading with sufficient liquidity before a token becomes listed on a centralized exchange. Furthermore, as all activity on a DEX is governed by the underlying smart contracts, traders do not have to give up custody of their funds to a third party.","In addition, DEXs can provide higher execution reliability during high volatility events caused by cascading liquidations of derivative positions on centralized exchanges. While CEXs might not be responsive at all for short periods of time due to API overloads, DEX trading remains functional and orders can be reliably executed, although the fees required to complete transactions might drastically increase in the short term (particularly in the case of Ethereum-based transactions).","Unfortunately, many of the benefits of using a DEX are a double-edged sword, and institutional users, in particular, face certain risks. For one, most of DeFi is currently unregulated and participants typically do not undergo KYC. Anyone can download a wallet such as Metamask and start trading tokens immediately.","The lack of regulation acts as a honeypot for scam token operators launching their own pools, and DEXs have also been implicated in money laundering. For instance, after centralized exchange KuCoin suffered a major hack in late 2020 without a cryptocurrency marketing strategy, and the culprits used decentralized exchanges to trade nearly $20 million of stolen tokens. The lack of a regulatory compliant legal framework creates an entry barrier for institutions that are forced to act within the confines of licensed secondary markets.","Similarly, slippage and front-running are also common risks on DEXs. Blockchain transactions are not instant, and in the volatile cryptocurrency markets, prices can move in the time it takes for an order to be executed as a confirmed transaction. On-chain trading is also subject to network congestion which may lead to much higher execution fees compared to centralized exchanges.","Besides, due to the open nature of public blockchains, anyone can view the pool of transactions waiting to be confirmed. Front-runners set up bots to scan the pool for potentially profitable arbitrage trades, and when they spot one, they immediately make the same transaction, but for a higher fee, making it more attractive for a miner to pick out of the queue. Many DEXs and platforms have taken steps to combat this risk, but it remains a persistent problem.","Further, the transparency of the smart contract code underlying DeFi protocols allows anyone to view it, but that also means anyone can find and exploit code bugs and vulnerabilities. As such, smart contract risk is a persistent problem for the DeFi sector, resulting in a proliferation of dedicated DeFi insurance pools, such as Nexus Mutual or Opium Insurance, which offer coverage for smart contract risk. It is also becoming more common for projects to use code auditing services from established cybersecurity consulting firms like CertiK or Kaspersky, as well as pay generous bug bounties to white-hat developers.","Beyond the risk element, institutions may also find that the DEX user experience lacks in several areas.","Although it is theoretically possible to trade any tokens, only the largest pools have sufficient depth of liquidity for large trades. DeFi exists entirely separately from the traditional financial system, so there is no way to get started on a DEX using fiat currencies. Instead, the user must first obtain crypto using a centralized service before they can participate in DeFi.","DEXs also necessitate self-custody, whereas many institutions may prefer to use a custody provider for digital assets. At the outset of the DeFi wave, user interfaces often tended to be an afterthought for developers who were more focused on smart contract code. This is evidenced by the user interface of services like Curve Finance which still has the look and feel of a DOS computer program of the 1980s.","In addition, DEXs tended not to offer the range of order types, charting tools, or technical indicators found on many of their centralized counterparts. However, this is rapidly changing. The more recent emergence of DEXs like dYdX and Perp offer decentralized, self-custodial spot and derivatives trading combined with a user interface similar to a CEX. This shows that decentralization does not necessarily need to come at the expense of features and user experience.","Decentralized exchanges have made huge advances in recent years, growing from a niche concept to accumulate billions of dollars in locked-in assets. While institutions are rightly intrigued by the concept and some are keen to capitalize on the transformative potential of DEXs, they should be aware of the regulatory and operational challenges involved."],"create_date":"2021-10-14T09:12:03+02:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

Anyone can download a wallet such as Metamask and start trading tokens immediately.","The lack of regulation acts as a honeypot for scam token operators launching their own pools, and DEXs have also been implicated in money laundering. For instance, after centralized exchange KuCoin suffered a major hack in late 2020 without a cryptocurrency marketing strategy, and the culprits used decentralized exchanges to trade nearly $20 million of stolen tokens. The lack of a regulatory compliant legal framework creates an entry barrier for institutions that are forced to act within the confines of licensed secondary markets.","Similarly, slippage and front-running are also common risks on DEXs. Blockchain transactions are not instant, and in the volatile cryptocurrency markets, prices can move in the time it takes for an order to be executed as a confirmed transaction. On-chain trading is also subject to network congestion which may lead to much higher execution fees compared to centralized exchanges.","Besides, due to the open nature of public blockchains, anyone can view the pool of transactions waiting to be confirmed. Front-runners set up bots to scan the pool for potentially profitable arbitrage trades, and when they spot one, they immediately make the same transaction, but for a higher fee, making it more attractive for a miner to pick out of the queue. Many DEXs and platforms have taken steps to combat this risk, but it remains a persistent problem.","Further, the transparency of the smart contract code underlying DeFi protocols allows anyone to view it, but that also means anyone can find and exploit code bugs and vulnerabilities. As such, smart contract risk is a persistent problem for the DeFi sector, resulting in a proliferation of dedicated DeFi insurance pools, such as Nexus Mutual or Opium Insurance, which offer coverage for smart contract risk. It is also becoming more common for projects to use code auditing services from established cybersecurity consulting firms like CertiK or Kaspersky, as well as pay generous bug bounties to white-hat developers.","Beyond the risk element, institutions may also find that the DEX user experience lacks in several areas.","Although it is theoretically possible to trade any tokens, only the largest pools have sufficient depth of liquidity for large trades. DeFi exists entirely separately from the traditional financial system, so there is no way to get started on a DEX using fiat currencies. Instead, the user must first obtain crypto using a centralized service before they can participate in DeFi.","DEXs also necessitate self-custody, whereas many institutions may prefer to use a custody provider for digital assets. At the outset of the DeFi wave, user interfaces often tended to be an afterthought for developers who were more focused on smart contract code. This is evidenced by the user interface of services like Curve Finance which still has the look and feel of a DOS computer program of the 1980s.","In addition, DEXs tended not to offer the range of order types, charting tools, or technical indicators found on many of their centralized counterparts. However, this is rapidly changing. The more recent emergence of DEXs like dYdX and Perp offer decentralized, self-custodial spot and derivatives trading combined with a user interface similar to a CEX. This shows that decentralization does not necessarily need to come at the expense of features and user experience.","Decentralized exchanges have made huge advances in recent years, growing from a niche concept to accumulate billions of dollars in locked-in assets. While institutions are rightly intrigued by the concept and some are keen to capitalize on the transformative potential of DEXs, they should be aware of the regulatory and operational challenges involved."],"create_date":"2021-10-14T09:12:03+02:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

Unsurprisingly, Shiba Inu is among the top gainers, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) price pumping by an astonishing 335% over the last 30 days. BlockDAG (BDAG) and Raffle Coin (RAFF) are stealing the show in the presale market. Keep reading for a closer look at these developments and discover which one of these coins could be the golden ticket in the next crypto bull run of 2024.","The Raffle Coin (RAFF) project aims to address the absence of a unified decentralised platform for raffles, lotteries, and giveaways. It introduces a privacy-centric, decentralised hub where users can load their accounts with supported cryptos and join in various prize draws, ranging from crypto to cars and lux holiday packages.","","Apart from its unique value proposition, the Raffle Coin (RAFF) presale draws investors’ attention with permanent liquidity locking, a 2-year freeze on team-held coins, and successful audit completion.","On March 1, 3.75 million of SHIB were intentionally removed from the SHIB supply. This destruction, part of a ” burning process,” left around 581.65 trillion SHIB coins available for circulation.","As a result of this massive reduction in SHIB supply, SHIB’s rally gained enormous momentum, up by 281% over the last seven days and by 335% over the previous month. Another key factor propelling the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is the generally bullish sentiment spurred by the anticipation of the Bitcoin halving.","","BlockDAG (BDAG), an emerging PoW project that builds on the Kaspa protocol, has quickly caught the attention of early investors, having already raised over $2.6 million despite being only in the second batch of its presale.","BlockDAG’s unique value proposition includes a series of mining rigs designed to use minimum power while maintaining high efficiency. They come in four types: X1, X10, X30, and X100, each with increasing mining power.","The X1 is a simple app for your phone that lets you mine up to 20 BDAG coins daily without draining your battery. The X10 model ups the ante, allowing you to mine up to 200 BDAG a day. If you aim higher, the X30 can get you 600 BDAG daily, and the top-tier X100 model can pull in a whopping 2,000 BDAG daily. With over 3,100 units already sold, BlockDAG’s mining solutions demand is already evident.","BlockDAG is currently in its second presale batch, priced at just $0.0015 per BDAG. The project plans to release 45 presale batches, with the price slated to reach $0.05 by the final batch.","","In response to the overwhelming early investor interest and the $2M raised quickly, BlockDAG has announced a $2 million mega giveaway shared by 50 lucky community members. To participate in the giveaway, follow BlockDAG’s social media channels, submit your wallet address, increase your chances by completing all quests, and bring friends for additional entries!","Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has surged by 335% over the past month, yet a potential decline looms as Bitcoin nears consolidation. BlockDAG (BDAG) and Raffle Coin (RAFF) are stealing the limelight among presales. Of particular note is the BlockDAG project, which has already raised over $2.6 and sold over 3100 of its mining units. As the price is slated to increase with each subsequent presale batch, with 45 batches in total, the opportune time to invest in BlockDAG is now, while the project is still early in its presale.","","Invest In BlockDAG Today"],"create_date":"2024-03-06T01:06:28+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

This is in contrast to execution on retail spot exchanges, which can be laden with volatility, sudden price movements, and significantly wider spreads.","“TAS provides a way to offset the risk of price movements on their futures positions and/or rebalance the gamma on option positions with no risk of excessive slippage.

Or that a loan company helps businesses with crypto. After all, the traditional financial and insurance industries were among the first to adopt cryptocurrencies. The latter ones have found more than one way to incorporate these means of payment into their business. This approach proved useful not only for companies but also for policyholders.","The above claim was confirmed by several recent surveys, including that of Goldman Sachs, which showed that 6% of respondents (over 300 financial executives in the insurance sector) verified that their companies invest in crypto.","Several things make cryptocurrencies attractive, not only for insurance companies but also for policyholders. Some of them are beneficial to both parties, and some are specific.","So, when it comes to policyholders, they can expect several advantages of using crypto. One of the most notable is the opportunity for diversification. Thanks to crypto, they can get another asset (on top of the traditional ones) to add to their diversification strategy. By doing this, they can spread risk and keep their funds protected.","Also, policyholders can count on speedy transactions because crypto transactions are usually processed much faster than wire transfers. Receiving claim payouts on time in urgent situations is possible thanks to cryptocurrency.","We should also note that they get more privacy because they can stay pseudonymous.","On the other hand, insurance companies benefit from reduced transaction costs, faster settlements, improved security, and a few other things.","It’s one thing to discuss things in theory and another to see how they work in real life. Fortunately, there are many successful examples of insurance companies accepting crypto as a payment plan.","","INGUARD is one of the leading digital insurance companies based in the U.S. It provides its services in all 50 U.S. States. What makes INGUARD truly special is that they were the first insurance companies in North America to accept Bitcoin payments in 2013.","Interestingly, this brand is partnered with numerous tech companies who share their vision for insurance, including Fitbit and Michelin.","Some insurance companies rely on the blockchain. Lemonade is an excellent example of this. This brand throws blockchain technology and artificial intelligence into the mix or provides pet, car, home, and other types of insurance. It goes without saying that policyholders can use cryptocurrency as a payment plan.","","Compiling a list of insurance companies accepting crypto without mentioning AXA would be a mistake. This insurance provider comes from Switzerland. It was the first insurer in Switzerland (and among the first in Europe) to enable its customers to pay bills with Bitcoin. This move didn’t come as too much of a surprise, as their Hong Kong subsidiary was one of the first to enter the gaming virtual world by partnering up with The Sandbox metaverse developer, meaning the crypto-progressive incline was already there.","It’s worth noting that AXA works with Bitcoin Suisse (a cryptocurrency exchange) and Inapay (a mobile Bitcoin payment processor for mobile devices) to process the payments.","Next on the list, we have Metromile. This auto insurer was established in 2011 in California as a tech startup. Today, more than 100,000 drivers use Metromile for pay-per-mile car insurance, and many use cryptocurrency to pay for this. The good news is that policyholders can pay for various insurance premiums in Bitcoin and use it to claim payouts.","From Massachusetts comes Premier Shield Insurance, an insurance agency focused on several sectors. From auto insurance and identity theft insurance to home insurance and various types of business insurance options – this company has its clients covered. The best part is that they can use crypto to cover agency fees and pay insurance premiums.","There’s a limit for paying in crypto set at $5,000. Also, another downside is that you can’t claim payouts in Bitcoin.","Even though finding data on cryptocurrency and its use in the insurance sector is somewhat challenging, a thorough analysis will show you that these two are becoming closer than ever.","This makes sense because the use of cryptocurrency is growing. Dozens of countries across the globe have legalized this means of payment, and two of them have made it an official legal tender.","According to some market analysis, we should expect tremendous growth in the next few years. For instance, if the blockchain (crypto payments included) in the insurance market size was around 208 million dollars in 2020, it should reach 2.5 billion dollars by 2028, which is almost a tenfold rise."],"create_date":"2023-11-20T07:07:04+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

With long weekday hours plus Saturday access, I could conveniently buy/sell between touring the island’s gorgeous beaches and historic sites!","How Bcash is Making Crypto User-Friendly in Greece","As a blockchain analyst who has helped many first-time crypto investors in Greece, I appreciate how Bcash excels at a smooth and understandable Bitcoin purchasing process. Their commitment to beginner education and support makes cryptocurrency less intimidating. Bcash also focuses on fair pricing and fees compared to traditional finance players.","Beginner-Friendly ATM Machines and Process","I often recommend Bcash’s Bitcoin ATMs for new Greek investors since their interface proving easy to follow self-guided steps. The on-screen prompts clearly cover scanning wallet QR codes, inserting cash bills, and confirming the crypto transfer. Bcash also guides new buyers in creating a digital currency account on their website before visiting the ATM.","Excellent Customer Support for Smooth Purchasing","Especially for crypto beginners, Bcash provides exceptional customer assistance to alleviate concerns over using Bitcoin ATMs or navigating wallet transfers. Their support team is available for live chat, phone, email, and even Telegram. I relied on them many times when learning to purchase BTC and ETH across their Greek ATM network.","Competitive Exchange Rates and Fees","From comparing Bcash’s crypto prices to other Athens-based brokerages and exchanges, I confirmed Bcash aims to offer fair market rates with typical fees under 10%. Far below the fees charged at Greek banks and trading platforms, Bcash passing savings to investors provides good value. This competitive pricing approach increases Bitcoin’s accessibility.","By focusing on convenience, education, support, and reasonable costs, Bcash succeeds at making cryptocurrencies understandable and approachable across Greece. Their extensive Bitcoin ATM network combined with helpful guidance lowers barriers for curious first-time buyers. Bcash makes exploring digital currency investing easy.","The Future of Crypto Acceptance in Greece","As a crypto analyst closely following blockchain innovation in Southeastern Europe, I see enormous growth potential for cryptocurrency usage across Greece. Bitcoin ATM platforms like Bcash have successfully built consumer awareness and understanding of digital coins over the past few years. Greece now counts over 50 Bitcoin ATM locations across Athens, Thessaloniki, popular tourist destinations, and more.","And the improved regulatory environment enables further mainstream crypto acceptance. Greece’s 2020 legislation aligned local digital asset rules with the European Union’s anti-money laundering directives. This risk reduction paved the way for more Greeks to comfortably explore decentralized finance through accessible solutions from Bcash.","On the merchant side, point-of-sale tools and business incentives for accepting payments in Bitcoin or Ethereum have also increased. As more customers request to transact or settle bills via cryptocurrency, I expect small Greek retailers, vendors, professionals to welcome crypto over the coming decade.","Between the expanding crypto ATM infrastructure, informed investors through Bcash’s educational initiatives, updated regulations, and motivated sellers, Greece appears poised to become one of Europe’s leading environments to utilize secure, frictionless cryptocurrency apps by 2030. The foundations support 10%+ of Greek financial flows leveraging blockchain within 10 years.",""],"create_date":"2024-03-03T18:18:46+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

Unsurprisingly, Shiba Inu is among the top gainers, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) price pumping by an astonishing 335% over the last 30 days. BlockDAG (BDAG) and Raffle Coin (RAFF) are stealing the show in the presale market. Keep reading for a closer look at these developments and discover which one of these coins could be the golden ticket in the next crypto bull run of 2024.","The Raffle Coin (RAFF) project aims to address the absence of a unified decentralised platform for raffles, lotteries, and giveaways. It introduces a privacy-centric, decentralised hub where users can load their accounts with supported cryptos and join in various prize draws, ranging from crypto to cars and lux holiday packages.","","Apart from its unique value proposition, the Raffle Coin (RAFF) presale draws investors’ attention with permanent liquidity locking, a 2-year freeze on team-held coins, and successful audit completion.","On March 1, 3.75 million of SHIB were intentionally removed from the SHIB supply. This destruction, part of a ” burning process,” left around 581.65 trillion SHIB coins available for circulation.","As a result of this massive reduction in SHIB supply, SHIB’s rally gained enormous momentum, up by 281% over the last seven days and by 335% over the previous month. Another key factor propelling the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is the generally bullish sentiment spurred by the anticipation of the Bitcoin halving.","","BlockDAG (BDAG), an emerging PoW project that builds on the Kaspa protocol, has quickly caught the attention of early investors, having already raised over $2.6 million despite being only in the second batch of its presale.","BlockDAG’s unique value proposition includes a series of mining rigs designed to use minimum power while maintaining high efficiency. They come in four types: X1, X10, X30, and X100, each with increasing mining power.","The X1 is a simple app for your phone that lets you mine up to 20 BDAG coins daily without draining your battery. The X10 model ups the ante, allowing you to mine up to 200 BDAG a day. If you aim higher, the X30 can get you 600 BDAG daily, and the top-tier X100 model can pull in a whopping 2,000 BDAG daily. With over 3,100 units already sold, BlockDAG’s mining solutions demand is already evident.","BlockDAG is currently in its second presale batch, priced at just $0.0015 per BDAG. The project plans to release 45 presale batches, with the price slated to reach $0.05 by the final batch.","","In response to the overwhelming early investor interest and the $2M raised quickly, BlockDAG has announced a $2 million mega giveaway shared by 50 lucky community members. To participate in the giveaway, follow BlockDAG’s social media channels, submit your wallet address, increase your chances by completing all quests, and bring friends for additional entries!","Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has surged by 335% over the past month, yet a potential decline looms as Bitcoin nears consolidation. BlockDAG (BDAG) and Raffle Coin (RAFF) are stealing the limelight among presales. Of particular note is the BlockDAG project, which has already raised over $2.6 and sold over 3100 of its mining units. As the price is slated to increase with each subsequent presale batch, with 45 batches in total, the opportune time to invest in BlockDAG is now, while the project is still early in its presale.","","Invest In BlockDAG Today"],"create_date":"2024-03-06T01:06:28+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

Or that a loan company helps businesses with crypto. After all, the traditional financial and insurance industries were among the first to adopt cryptocurrencies. The latter ones have found more than one way to incorporate these means of payment into their business. This approach proved useful not only for companies but also for policyholders.","The above claim was confirmed by several recent surveys, including that of Goldman Sachs, which showed that 6% of respondents (over 300 financial executives in the insurance sector) verified that their companies invest in crypto.","Several things make cryptocurrencies attractive, not only for insurance companies but also for policyholders. Some of them are beneficial to both parties, and some are specific.","So, when it comes to policyholders, they can expect several advantages of using crypto. One of the most notable is the opportunity for diversification. Thanks to crypto, they can get another asset (on top of the traditional ones) to add to their diversification strategy. By doing this, they can spread risk and keep their funds protected.","Also, policyholders can count on speedy transactions because crypto transactions are usually processed much faster than wire transfers. Receiving claim payouts on time in urgent situations is possible thanks to cryptocurrency.","We should also note that they get more privacy because they can stay pseudonymous.","On the other hand, insurance companies benefit from reduced transaction costs, faster settlements, improved security, and a few other things.","It’s one thing to discuss things in theory and another to see how they work in real life. Fortunately, there are many successful examples of insurance companies accepting crypto as a payment plan.","","INGUARD is one of the leading digital insurance companies based in the U.S. It provides its services in all 50 U.S. States. What makes INGUARD truly special is that they were the first insurance companies in North America to accept Bitcoin payments in 2013.","Interestingly, this brand is partnered with numerous tech companies who share their vision for insurance, including Fitbit and Michelin.","Some insurance companies rely on the blockchain. Lemonade is an excellent example of this. This brand throws blockchain technology and artificial intelligence into the mix or provides pet, car, home, and other types of insurance. It goes without saying that policyholders can use cryptocurrency as a payment plan.","","Compiling a list of insurance companies accepting crypto without mentioning AXA would be a mistake. This insurance provider comes from Switzerland. It was the first insurer in Switzerland (and among the first in Europe) to enable its customers to pay bills with Bitcoin. This move didn’t come as too much of a surprise, as their Hong Kong subsidiary was one of the first to enter the gaming virtual world by partnering up with The Sandbox metaverse developer, meaning the crypto-progressive incline was already there.","It’s worth noting that AXA works with Bitcoin Suisse (a cryptocurrency exchange) and Inapay (a mobile Bitcoin payment processor for mobile devices) to process the payments.","Next on the list, we have Metromile. This auto insurer was established in 2011 in California as a tech startup. Today, more than 100,000 drivers use Metromile for pay-per-mile car insurance, and many use cryptocurrency to pay for this. The good news is that policyholders can pay for various insurance premiums in Bitcoin and use it to claim payouts.","From Massachusetts comes Premier Shield Insurance, an insurance agency focused on several sectors. From auto insurance and identity theft insurance to home insurance and various types of business insurance options – this company has its clients covered. The best part is that they can use crypto to cover agency fees and pay insurance premiums.","There’s a limit for paying in crypto set at $5,000. Also, another downside is that you can’t claim payouts in Bitcoin.","Even though finding data on cryptocurrency and its use in the insurance sector is somewhat challenging, a thorough analysis will show you that these two are becoming closer than ever.","This makes sense because the use of cryptocurrency is growing. Dozens of countries across the globe have legalized this means of payment, and two of them have made it an official legal tender.","According to some market analysis, we should expect tremendous growth in the next few years. For instance, if the blockchain (crypto payments included) in the insurance market size was around 208 million dollars in 2020, it should reach 2.5 billion dollars by 2028, which is almost a tenfold rise."],"create_date":"2023-11-20T07:07:04+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

Additionally, DeFi is now drawing in significant sums in venture capital.","Although virtually every new initiative claims to be offering something different, the majority of DeFi’s growth has been driven by two main segments – lending pools and decentralized exchanges (DEX). The latter has undergone several iterations over the years, but the embedded model is broadly based on the ideas pioneered by exchanges such as Uniswap and Bancor.","What exactly is a DEX?","In a nutshell, a DEX connects sellers and buyers and automatically calculates exchange rates and fees based on supply and demand. Rather than buyers and sellers being matched through an order book like on a centralized exchange, smart contracts perform all trades. DEXs like Uniswap typically operate by means of liquidity pools comprising a pair of tokens. Such a liquidity pool might contain Bitcoin (BTC) and a US-dollar stablecoin like Tether (USDT), for example.","In return for providing liquidity to the pool by “locking in” assets, users often referred to as “yield farmers” earn a share of the transaction fees paid by traders who use it to swap tokens. Yields adjust according to the relative scarcity of assets in the pool. Returning to the previous pair, for instance, if the volume of USDT were running low, the yield would automatically increase to incentivize users to provide more liquidity. The goal is to create a decentralized and automated trading system. Other exchanges like Balancer operate multi-token pools, whereas Curve Finance focuses on stablecoin arbitrage.","While much of the growth in DEX usage has been driven by the retail segment, there is increasing evidence of institutional interest in the space, according to a recent report from Chainalysis. However, DEXs are a very different proposition from their centralized counterparts and come with a unique set of opportunities and challenges for institutional players.","The advantages of DEXs over centralized exchanges","Firstly, their open and permissionless nature means that DEXs can list an extraordinarily large array of tokens, as anyone can launch their own liquidity pools. At one point in 2020, Coindesk reported that Uniswap had added over a thousand new token pairs in a single week. Therefore, DEXs give early investors the ability to start trading with sufficient liquidity before a token becomes listed on a centralized exchange. Furthermore, as all activity on a DEX is governed by the underlying smart contracts, traders do not have to give up custody of their funds to a third party.","In addition, DEXs can provide higher execution reliability during high volatility events caused by cascading liquidations of derivative positions on centralized exchanges. While CEXs might not be responsive at all for short periods of time due to API overloads, DEX trading remains functional and orders can be reliably executed, although the fees required to complete transactions might drastically increase in the short term (particularly in the case of Ethereum-based transactions).","Unfortunately, many of the benefits of using a DEX are a double-edged sword, and institutional users, in particular, face certain risks. For one, most of DeFi is currently unregulated and participants typically do not undergo KYC. Anyone can download a wallet such as Metamask and start trading tokens immediately.","The lack of regulation acts as a honeypot for scam token operators launching their own pools, and DEXs have also been implicated in money laundering. For instance, after centralized exchange KuCoin suffered a major hack in late 2020 without a cryptocurrency marketing strategy, and the culprits used decentralized exchanges to trade nearly $20 million of stolen tokens. The lack of a regulatory compliant legal framework creates an entry barrier for institutions that are forced to act within the confines of licensed secondary markets.","Similarly, slippage and front-running are also common risks on DEXs. Blockchain transactions are not instant, and in the volatile cryptocurrency markets, prices can move in the time it takes for an order to be executed as a confirmed transaction. On-chain trading is also subject to network congestion which may lead to much higher execution fees compared to centralized exchanges.","Besides, due to the open nature of public blockchains, anyone can view the pool of transactions waiting to be confirmed. Front-runners set up bots to scan the pool for potentially profitable arbitrage trades, and when they spot one, they immediately make the same transaction, but for a higher fee, making it more attractive for a miner to pick out of the queue. Many DEXs and platforms have taken steps to combat this risk, but it remains a persistent problem.","Further, the transparency of the smart contract code underlying DeFi protocols allows anyone to view it, but that also means anyone can find and exploit code bugs and vulnerabilities. As such, smart contract risk is a persistent problem for the DeFi sector, resulting in a proliferation of dedicated DeFi insurance pools, such as Nexus Mutual or Opium Insurance, which offer coverage for smart contract risk. It is also becoming more common for projects to use code auditing services from established cybersecurity consulting firms like CertiK or Kaspersky, as well as pay generous bug bounties to white-hat developers.","Beyond the risk element, institutions may also find that the DEX user experience lacks in several areas.","Although it is theoretically possible to trade any tokens, only the largest pools have sufficient depth of liquidity for large trades. DeFi exists entirely separately from the traditional financial system, so there is no way to get started on a DEX using fiat currencies. Instead, the user must first obtain crypto using a centralized service before they can participate in DeFi.","DEXs also necessitate self-custody, whereas many institutions may prefer to use a custody provider for digital assets. At the outset of the DeFi wave, user interfaces often tended to be an afterthought for developers who were more focused on smart contract code. This is evidenced by the user interface of services like Curve Finance which still has the look and feel of a DOS computer program of the 1980s.","In addition, DEXs tended not to offer the range of order types, charting tools, or technical indicators found on many of their centralized counterparts. However, this is rapidly changing. The more recent emergence of DEXs like dYdX and Perp offer decentralized, self-custodial spot and derivatives trading combined with a user interface similar to a CEX. This shows that decentralization does not necessarily need to come at the expense of features and user experience.","Decentralized exchanges have made huge advances in recent years, growing from a niche concept to accumulate billions of dollars in locked-in assets. While institutions are rightly intrigued by the concept and some are keen to capitalize on the transformative potential of DEXs, they should be aware of the regulatory and operational challenges involved."],"create_date":"2021-10-14T09:12:03+02:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

With that in mind, it’s a","title":"4 Things We’ve Learned About Owning Bitcoin in 2023","content":["For some people, the word bitcoin still triggers an eye-roll, but by now, most of us know that cryptocurrency is here to stay. With that in mind, it’s a good idea to make sure you’re clued up and well-educated on the topic, especially if you’ve ever considered investing yourself.","However, with so much misinformation floating around on the world wide web, it’s easy to assume that steering clear is safest, or to get overwhelmed with how to approach the process. If you’ve been having a bit of an internal battle over the ins and outs of crypto, here are some of the most important things we’ve learned about it over the years.","1. Education is Key","No matter what the nay-sayers might suggest, there’s nothing inherently dangerous or even risky about investing in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. However, it is absolutely crucial that you get educated before committing to it – because uninformed decisions are what lead to disaster in any type of investing move.","There is an abundance of information available online. Look to professionals in the industry, and consult the Crypto 101 video series to help you understand the basics. You can even pay for professional consultants to help you in your journey if you want to be more assured you’re making good choices.","2. You Need a Secure Wallet","Choosing your crypto wallet is a bigger deal than you might think. Your wallet is your portal into the crypto world, and so picking something secure and reliable is important for a myriad of reasons.","An all-in-one wallet like Noones is one of the best options out there because the process becomes incredibly simplified. However, there are countless options on the market. What matters is that you do your research and pick a wallet that aligns with your needs, offers security, and has good user reviews. The voice of the people is always something to pay attention to, and if multiple people have had a negative experience, it’s a good sign to steer clear.","3. Scams and Phishing Are Real Problems","Even though more and more people are wising up, there are some common crypto scams that are still alive and well in 2023, and it’s essential that you’re aware of them and know how to protect yourself.","Make sure you know about the potential risks, and avoid ever sharing private keys or personal information with anyone – especially over text or online messaging. You should be able to identify the warning signs, but when it comes to your finances online, it’s best to be extra vigilant.","4. Diversifying is Smart","Any serious investors will tell you how important it is to diversify your portfolio, and having a well-balanced crypto portfolio is just as important as balancing your stock investments.","A crucial part of this is maintaining the balance between your crypto portfolio and overall investment portfolio. However, you’ll also want to ensure that your crypto portfolio itself contains a few different types of cryptocurrency with different risk levels."],"create_date":"2023-11-13T10:10:08+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

Located just 20 minutes from the city center, it makes crypto conveniently accessible for residents across northeast Athens.","","Piraeus Port Shopping District ATM","","While recently docking overnight at the Piraeus cruise port as part of an Aegean island-hopping vacation, I encountered one of Bcash’s handy crypto ATMs just 5 minutes from the passenger terminals.

They offer a minimum of 1 confirmation and have both TOR and clear web services. They carry no logs and have a user-controlled time delay function.","⦁ Mixtum Staunch and pricey, Mixtum refers to itself as a “premium bitcoin mixer”. While one might assume that because of the astronomical 4-5% transaction fee, or rather dear 0.001BTC minimum deposit, their bougie tag line actually comes from their level of anonymity. With little to no user control, the site requires that users use at least two output addresses and multiple confirmations. Their process generally takes about 6 hours, but the anonymity of the tumbled coins are second to none.","⦁ Bitcloak Brand new to the bitcoin tumbler block, bitcloak is all about ease. They sport a 2% transaction fee with a 0.0004BTC network fee. The company requires a minimum deposit of 0.01BTC, supports up to 10 addresses and requires at least one confirmation. There’s a letter of guarantee as well. You can peek in on your mix during its progress and every bit of information about your mix is deleted within 24 hours.","⦁ PrivCoin PrivCoin supports a wealth of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and bitcoin cash. They have a low fixed transaction rate of 0.5% and tack on a 0.0005BTC fee for additional addresses, up to 10. They require anywhere from 1 to 50 confirmations and have a zero logs policy. There’s also a referral program and a letter of guarantee.","⦁ SmartMixer Variable transaction rate at 1-5%. They have no minimum deposit, but the transaction rates are fairly steep. Must have a minimum of three confirmations and SmartMixer holds logs for 24 hours, after which they automatically delete. They offer both TOR and clear web mixers for those that are uncomfortable with dark web browsers. Arguably a good mixer, but not designed for the pros.","⦁ ChipMixer ChipMixer is truly a stand-alone bitcoin tumbler. They have a minimum deposit of 0.001BTC, but pretty much everything after that is user-controlled. Transaction fees are mostly donation, unlimited output addresses and a zero logs policy. They also offer a letter of guarantee. With super high anonymity and a long list of user controls, ChipMixer is bound to quickly be embraced as the best.","⦁ Bitcoin Laundry A relatively new name in bitcoin blenders, they are quickly gaining “best” status. Their only fees are a 0.0002BTC fee per output address, no transaction fees are incurred. A super-low minimum deposit of 0.0005BTC and have a minimum confirmation requirement of 1. They also operate on both TOR and clear web- which is quickly becoming the norm. There is a user-controlled time delay function as well. However, the company does retain logs for a week after mixing, which can be a massive turn-off for many potential customers."],"create_date":"2020-02-18T07:07:01+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}

With that in mind, it’s a good idea to make sure you’re clued up and well-educated on the topic, especially if you’ve ever considered investing yourself.","However, with so much misinformation floating around on the world wide web, it’s easy to assume that steering clear is safest, or to get overwhelmed with how to approach the process. If you’ve been having a bit of an internal battle over the ins and outs of crypto, here are some of the most important things we’ve learned about it over the years.","1. Education is Key","No matter what the nay-sayers might suggest, there’s nothing inherently dangerous or even risky about investing in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. However, it is absolutely crucial that you get educated before committing to it – because uninformed decisions are what lead to disaster in any type of investing move.","There is an abundance of information available online. Look to professionals in the industry, and consult the Crypto 101 video series to help you understand the basics. You can even pay for professional consultants to help you in your journey if you want to be more assured you’re making good choices.","2. You Need a Secure Wallet","Choosing your crypto wallet is a bigger deal than you might think. Your wallet is your portal into the crypto world, and so picking something secure and reliable is important for a myriad of reasons.","An all-in-one wallet like Noones is one of the best options out there because the process becomes incredibly simplified. However, there are countless options on the market. What matters is that you do your research and pick a wallet that aligns with your needs, offers security, and has good user reviews. The voice of the people is always something to pay attention to, and if multiple people have had a negative experience, it’s a good sign to steer clear.","3. Scams and Phishing Are Real Problems","Even though more and more people are wising up, there are some common crypto scams that are still alive and well in 2023, and it’s essential that you’re aware of them and know how to protect yourself.","Make sure you know about the potential risks, and avoid ever sharing private keys or personal information with anyone – especially over text or online messaging. You should be able to identify the warning signs, but when it comes to your finances online, it’s best to be extra vigilant.","4. Diversifying is Smart","Any serious investors will tell you how important it is to diversify your portfolio, and having a well-balanced crypto portfolio is just as important as balancing your stock investments.","A crucial part of this is maintaining the balance between your crypto portfolio and overall investment portfolio. However, you’ll also want to ensure that your crypto portfolio itself contains a few different types of cryptocurrency with different risk levels."],"create_date":"2023-11-13T10:10:08+01:00","tag":"","author":"CryptoNinjas.net"}
