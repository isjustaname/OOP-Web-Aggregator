Discover how innovations are shaping a more environmentally friendly future for the digital currency world.”","Cryptocurrency has caught everyone’s attention with its promise to make money handling more secure and private. Yet, creating these digital coins, a process called “mining,” uses lots of power and harms our environment. It’s interesting to see how even non-traditional platforms like the 1xbet site, known for online betting, are getting on board with cryptocurrencies. This shows how widespread digital currencies are becoming and highlights the urgent need for environmentally friendly ways to produce them.","Crypto mining is key for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to work. It involves powerful computers solving complicated math problems. When these puzzles are solved, transactions are confirmed, and new coins are made. But, this requires a ton of electricity, raising concerns about its impact on our planet.","The search for green crypto mining has brought about smart new ideas. These ideas aim to reduce the harm mining does to the environment.","The technology behind cryptocurrencies, called blockchain, is also changing to support eco-friendly mining. Two important changes are:","– Proof of Stake (PoS): This new method doesn’t need miners to solve difficult puzzles, which cuts down on energy use. Instead, people are chosen to confirm transactions based on how much cryptocurrency they’re willing to lock away as a security deposit.","– Layer 2 Solutions: These are new layers added to the existing blockchain to speed up transactions and make them more efficient. This means less work for miners and less energy needed for mining.","The path to sustainable crypto mining is full of potential but also some big challenges. The focus moving forward includes:","Think of crypto mining as a huge global challenge of puzzle-solving. The old way of running this challenge is like keeping a large building’s lights on all the time. It uses too much energy and harms our Earth. What if we could keep the challenge going but use less energy? Or even use energy from the sun, wind, or water? That’s the goal of these new approaches.","Moreover, by simplifying the puzzles or altering the rules so they require less energy to solve, we take a significant step forward. This is what the latest blockchain technologies are designed to do.","Exploring sustainable crypto mining shows us that moving towards eco-friendly methods is good for the Earth. It also opens up new paths for innovation and economic development. Embracing sustainability isn’t just necessary; it’s an opportunity to change the way we use technology and energy in today’s digital world.","Adding renewable energy to crypto mining does more than cut carbon emissions. It also makes green energy more available and efficient. As crypto mining asks for more renewable energy, it speeds up the growth and use of clean energy technology. This could result in:","Eco-friendly mining can do more than just save the environment. It can also help communities grow. For example, the extra heat from mining can be used to warm buildings or help plants grow. This can boost local economies and provide important services. Plus, moving to greener mining methods can create jobs in clean energy. This offers people new skills and work chances all over the world.","To make eco-friendly crypto mining common, we need to teach and spread awareness. A lot of people don’t know how mining affects the environment or that greener options exist. By educating everyone, from everyday folks to crypto industry insiders, we can help them make better choices. Holding workshops, seminars, and sharing information online can really help share this knowledge. This way, we can build a community in the crypto news world that cares about being sustainable.","The future of sustainable crypto mining news is not only promising but also essential for the continued growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. As we look ahead, several developments could further enhance the sustainability of crypto mining:","The push for eco-friendly crypto mining news is part of a bigger trend. It’s about the tech world getting serious about protecting the environment. The crypto mining folks are showing us how tech and nature can get along. They’re using new ideas, working together, and sticking to eco-friendly ways. This effort is shining a light on a path that other industries can follow. As we move forward in the digital age, making crypto mining more sustainable is inspiring. It gives us hope. If we all pull together, aiming for a cleaner future, our tech advances will do more than just boost our economy. They’ll also keep our planet healthy for many more years.",""],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

The days when you could only bet at traditional casinos are over. Instead, the market is rapidly evolving towards new and captivating gaming mechanics. Besides, since the dawn of online gambling, the industry has always been at the forefront of adopting new technologies. The introduction of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has made their dreams come true.","Wait for a second! Did you know that the real gambling market is now heading towards immersive betting on the blockchain? This leads to the emergence of Metaverse casino games, allowing players to create their virtual world. But, of course, there’s still more to this! But before we move on, let’s check out Metaverse casinos!","First, you need to know that Metaverse Casino is more or less similar to conventional gambling sites. However, it is a decentralized betting industry where players can use digital currencies and NFTs instead of flats to play casino games, bet, win, and equally lose.","Metaverse casino has only been available for some time but has been widely adopted. Currently, it’s available on various blockchain gambling platforms. Many platforms offer games, such as blackjack, jackpot, roulette, poker, and more on the Las Vegas casino pages.","Most importantly, this online casino certainly offers fair games.

In addition to games, Metaverse Casino also offers the opportunity to leverage other Metaverse applications such as education, military, healthcare, manufacturing, and real estate to generate NFTs. Imagine exploring this application without leaving your comfort zone. But, of course, that feeling is unmatched.","Also, since Metaverse Casino is crypto-based, they do not accept real money or credit card payments. To access the unlimited Metaverse offerings, you must create a blockchain wallet and buy digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. On the other hand, most Metaverse casinos also accept payments in stablecoins such as USDT and BUSD. Ensure you sign up on a legit crypto gaming platform to avoid stories that touch the heart. You can check for trusted cryptocurrency gambling websites on CryptoGamble.tips","No doubt! Crypto gaming is enjoyable, and the metaverse casino world is expanding.

Of course, having many options can often become confusing, especially if you are new to the market. For that reason, we decided to write an article to differentiate the types of exchanges, and help you choose what is best for you.","In the next few chapters we discuss the top 5 platforms you should be aware of, their unique offer, and how you can use them to the best of your abilities in order to effectively participate in the crypto revolution. Let’s delve in.","Coinbase, much like many minimalistic exchanges, are essentially a brokerage. This is also why the price of cryptocurrencies is slightly higher compared to, say, trading platforms. The US-based exchange was created back in 2012 by Brian Armstrong , and has since grown to become the first unicorn startup listed in Nasdaq.","Coinbase is ideal for beginners. It does not have complex products that confuse new investors, but you can still make use of charts, withdraw your funds to any other platform, and feel safe for the security of your funds. While most claim that it’s best to keep your funds off exchanges, the platform has already filed insurance with the FDIC for amounts up to $250.000. So if you are new to crypto and you are looking for an easy solution to get started, make sure you check the exchange of Coinbase, as well as its useful knowledge base.","Binance is a trading platform/exchange that was established just 4 years ago, in 2017. In a few short months, the platform exploded in popularity, setting the standard for other competing platforms. So what makes Binance the best option for traders? First of all, there are more than 500 trading pairs, allowing users one of the largest pool of options available. Aside from that, the exchange also has a decentralized alternative known as Binance Smart Chain, for users that prefer not to keep their funds on the centralized platform.","Aside from trading, the platform also offers many different products mainly oriented to passive income (Earn section), derivatives trading, IEOs, as well as their own unique cryptocurrency debit card.","The oldest and most established platform for peer to peer trades is none other than LocalBitcoins. For many, the concept is relatively scary, as they fear that trading directly with another, unknown person can result in scams. However, for years now, LocalBitcoins proves that the system is one of the best options for those who are looking to pay using less popular payment methods.","The concept is simple. A user creates an offer (either buy or sell bitcoin) at a particular rate, listing the payment method they wish to receive. The other party finds this offer, agrees to the trade, and makes a payment from the indicated payment system.","In order to ensure that both parties follow through, the platform acts as an escrow. This means that the bitcoin remains temporarily in the custody of LocalBitcoins until proof is provided that the payment is made. Once confirmation arrives, the BTC is sent to the person who bought it.","Choosing a peer to peer exchange is a great way to go around a potential banking ban for cryptocurrencies, which is the case with many countries, like Nigeria, India, and others.","Next, let’s talk DEXs. The concept of decentralized exchange platforms became popular in 2019, when China was cracking down on China-based exchanges. To avoid the single point of failure that comes with storing funds on decentralized exchanges, innovators had to think of a way that cryptocurrencies can be traded freely, without the need for KYC.","This is exactly what DEX stands for. Users don’t need to create an account, or store their funds on a platform. Every process of the protocol happens through smart contracts which ensure that both parties keep the end of their deal. Uniswap is one of the most popular options available and its token, UNI, is based on the Ethereum network, which is also used for the gas fees.","While these four options are the most popular ways to get crypto, note that buying with cash is not possible. For this reason, it is important to note that bitcoin ATMs, as well as dedicated, brick-and-mortar stores are also available to help you transact effectively. However, in both accounts remember that you will most likely have to verify your identity if the purchase is larger than $1000. Therefore, before you make any investment decision, make sure you conduct your own research and know what you are getting into. This article is merely written to provide an educational perspective.","To further educate yourself and stay up to date with the latest cryptocurrency news, check out Coinspeaker.com."],"create_date":"2023-02-23T11:55:06+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Italy is one of the places where traditional casinos originated, and the Ridotto casino opened in Venice was a way of entertainment used to entertain people coming to the carnival at that time. It would not be wrong to think of it as the first legal casino open to the public. However, in other parts of Europe, casinos became widespread and popularized, while in the United States, of course, they were not lagging behind, developing their own casinos and building casinos that catered to the aristocratic class. But somewhere along the way they evolved into online casinos and we are going to give you some different information about how this process works, because with the development of online casinos, they diversified and crypto casinos emerged.","In fact, the popularity of online casinos is something that has emerged with the spread of the internet around the world. As the internet became more widespread in the 1990s, many different sectors started to move online, and the casinos that people physically went to gradually moved online. In 1994, with the first legal regulation, the way was paved for online casinos and this sector opened its doors to its customers. Of course, when these online casinos first appeared, they could not provide the same service to their players as they do now because the graphics were much more primitive than they are now.","However, as we get closer to the present day, these technologies have advanced considerably and are now able to cater to the modern demands of players. Nowadays, many different online casinos are emerging, including online casinos where you can pay with cryptocurrencies. These online casinos use different technologies that are designed to increase the security of the players and make their gaming experience easier and nowadays people are able to play interesting games with bitcoin thanks to these technologies.","There are actually many different advantages of using cryptocurrencies for players, and these advantages definitely improve the gaming experience. All of these advantages come about because all cryptocurrencies have their own unique features, which we’re going to talk about. When you transact with cryptocurrencies, you use a technology called blockchain technology, which is essentially blocks of data that are linked together cryptographically. Each block carries information about the block before it and they are connected to each other. At the same time, this information is processed on several computers that are also on the network. This makes it very easy to detect any problems in the blockchain. This blockchain technology actually helps players in a few different areas, one of which is that it ensures their importance.","","Players can play games and make deposits at online casinos without completely revealing their identity if they so wish. All of their personal and financial information will be kept private thanks to the blockchain technology we just mentioned. This is because, as we mentioned, the data contained in the blocks is cryptographically encrypted. Thanks to this encryption, it becomes unreadable and this prevents fraud. At the same time, different cryptocurrencies have different transaction fees, but they all have very low transaction fees compared to traditional payment methods because they eliminate third parties.","Thanks to these low transaction fees, crypto casinos have become very popular among players, and they are becoming more and more popular in this sector. This is not the only advantage besides low transaction fees, of course, when it comes to transactions. At the same time, the speed of transactions with almost all cryptocurrencies will be very fast and when you want to withdraw money, you will be able to do it instantly. With traditional payment methods, online casinos may sometimes give you a waiting period of days, but this is certainly not the case when you pay or withdraw with popular and niche cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Dogecoin.","","If we need to talk about other advantages of payments with cryptocurrencies, there are quite different advantages apart from the above, among which we can mention that cryptocurrencies are globally accessible because they are decentralized. Normally, when you want to pay at online casinos, not every payment method will be valid in every country, and if the payment method you use is not valid at the online casino, you will not be able to play there. But this is definitely not the case with cryptocurrencies, because these cryptocurrencies are valid all over the world, so people from all around the world will have the chance to play there.","There are other benefits to crypto casinos being such a global destination. Since these casinos cater to a wide audience, they always keep the wishes of their customers at the highest level and strive to meet their needs as soon as possible. On a site with this much traffic, the modern needs of customers are best met. In addition to this, again, since cryptocurrencies are decentralized, players can access greater comfort in legal matters because there is a possibility that countries may ban these games with their own money, but when it comes to cryptocurrencies, you will not be able to encounter such a problem because they are decentralized.","","Another point to mention is that thanks to blockchain technology, transactions can be made in a very transparent way. We have already talked about the blockchain process and how these blocks are protected and interconnected. These chains provide great transparency to players and casino owners, and any disruption in the chain is reported immediately, so the chances of you encountering any fraud or cheating are almost zero. In addition, with this technology, players can be sure that the game they are playing is fair and they know that they are randomly accessing the results.","One of the reasons why crypto casinos are becoming more popular and on the rise is the bonuses and promotions they offer players. These crypto casinos offer different bonuses to attract players and keep them on their websites, and all of these bonuses have different purposes and benefits. As this is a relatively new industry, the bonuses offered to players may be slightly different and juicier than the bonuses offered at regular online casinos. However, thanks to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, things can change and players’ winnings can change in a positive way.",""],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

These assets are securely stored in digital ledgers encoded by using powerful cryptography to protect them. The ledgers (also known as public ledgers) are disseminated all over the world, and every deal made using cryptocurrencies are referred to as blocks. Numerous blocks interconnecting to one another feature a “blockchain pattern” on the distributed ledger. There are around more than 47 million cryptocurrency users in the world. Cryptocurrencies are formed and maintained through cryptographic algorithms in a process called mining. The most popular cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, but Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), Monero are some of the other popular cryptocurrencies. However, almost all cryptocurrencies are equally important in the world of forex trading. There are also many Forex brokers accepting Tether (USDT) to provide their services.","The phrase ‘Forex’ enunciates the foreign exchange of an asset from various countries against each other. A forex broker is also known as a retail forex broker or a currency trading broker. Basically, forex brokers are collectively referred to as a global decentralized economic organization that empowers forex traders to a setting where they can purchase or swap foreign currencies. The trading always occurs in pairs (for example, U.S dollars against Euros). Forex is a brief term for foreign exchange, which consists of all aspects of purchasing, convincing people to accept, and swapping currencies at marked or new rates.","The customers of a forex broker constitute hefty economic corporations and commercial currency dealers who utilize these strategies for inference on the recommendation of currencies. A forex broker corporation will deal with only a minor amount of the quantity of the prevailing foreign trade market. With the help of these organizations, a dealer unlocks a business by purchasing a pair of currency and shuts down the marketing business by vending the identical pair. For illustration: a dealer who is willing to swap euros for pounds acquires the EUR/POUND pair. If the trade price is elevated when the dealer shuts the business, the dealer earns a revenue; else, the dealer takes a loss.","Bitcoin:","The forex trade market is the biggest international currency market and the most transparent market all over the nation. Also, just because the forex trade market is decentralized and has no centralized location, the users can trade forex for 24 hours a day from any specific location. Now, one of the most significant benefits of using Bitcoin (BTC) for trading forex is that it is decentralized too, i.e., it has no direct connection with the central authorities or central banking systems. Hence, the currencies are unrestricted from prominent government affairs and macroeconomic problems such as inflation or income taxes. Many forex brokers deliver clout for bitcoin barters as well. Skilled dealers can easily expend this to their usefulness. Nonetheless, such elevated ledges should also be moved toward with enormous vigilance as they heighten the possibility for failures.","In the forex trade market systems, a dealer can commence with an amount as meager as 20 dollars along with some bitcoin forex trading corporations. These forex trading corporations even propose improvements like a similar residue percentage. It’s the dealers’ job to examine that the seller is legal and suitably governed. Abundant forex dealers that ratify cryptocurrency are maintaining brokerage prices relatively low to captivate fresh customers. You don’t have to reveal your real identity or disclose your bank account/credit card info to generate a bitcoin agreement. Therefore, this is a substantial boon in tenures of expenditure and economic safety. Bitcoin pacts have no universal limitations- A dealer from Russia can exchange forex through a dealer in Canada. Administrative provocations may linger to be a trouble, but if both dealers and vendors are inclined to transact, there are no cartographic boundaries what so ever.","Ethereum:","Ethereum (ETH) is the second-most widely used cryptocurrency, which is the price tariff of the Ethereum tallying outlet and is an influential means to exchange. Regardless, it is crucial to trade this cryptocurrency with an adequately specified forex broker. The currency developed by the usage of Ether was recognized as a tremendous craze and extremely abrupt expansion, which even outperformed billion dollars recently. By rewarding or giving payments to those who could give rise to their tallying ability to the hierarchy and as a standard of expenditure under the conventional agreements.","Ethereum has accordingly produced a cryptocurrency that a priori matches the bitcoin because of both established on marketing ascertained by a system and functioning through evidence of analysis, making it reasonable to compensate the miners. Ethereum has no margin and is hence inflationary. It uses a similar algorithm as of now but is more likely to shift to another of the term “proof of stake” for its modern edition “serenity.” Ethereum is mined in approximately 14 seconds. Even though to corroborate a trade, the firms need 30 testimonies for the Ether (unlike only one confirmation for bitcoin), the time needed is less comparatively.","Litecoin","Litecoin (LTC) borrows the Scrypt procedure, which indicates that the makers operating hardware to enable the bitcoin system cannot transition to Litecoin. Therefore, it augments to the decentralized ordeal as the hefty makers cannot handily optimize their revenues by trading. Moreover, they are laboring on faith agreements too. Rapid mining, huge fences, and extra coins in dissemination make it even more susceptible to approval. Litecoin can transfer 23 coins in less than 10 seconds from a hardware wallet, namely Trezor, which has steered to the industries engaging interest in this crypto currency’s improvement and accepting it in their businesses also.","Litecoin’s value has been constant ever since, and it has a less elusive nature as described with Bitcoins. This is one of the major reasons as to why the value does not go like a bat out of hell or decrease so dramatically, and this is a promising aspect for investors willing to use litecoin as a trade currency. It’s a fact worth mentioning that Litecoin carried out modern technologies before Bitcoin did. It can also deal with an elevated quantity of agreements due to its algorithm.

There are also many Forex brokers accepting Tether (USDT) to provide their services.","The phrase ‘Forex’ enunciates the foreign exchange of an asset from various countries against each other. A forex broker is also known as a retail forex broker or a currency trading broker. Basically, forex brokers are collectively referred to as a global decentralized economic organization that empowers forex traders to a setting where they can purchase or swap foreign currencies. The trading always occurs in pairs (for example, U.S dollars against Euros). Forex is a brief term for foreign exchange, which consists of all aspects of purchasing, convincing people to accept, and swapping currencies at marked or new rates.","The customers of a forex broker constitute hefty economic corporations and commercial currency dealers who utilize these strategies for inference on the recommendation of currencies. A forex broker corporation will deal with only a minor amount of the quantity of the prevailing foreign trade market. With the help of these organizations, a dealer unlocks a business by purchasing a pair of currency and shuts down the marketing business by vending the identical pair. For illustration: a dealer who is willing to swap euros for pounds acquires the EUR/POUND pair. If the trade price is elevated when the dealer shuts the business, the dealer earns a revenue; else, the dealer takes a loss.","Bitcoin:","The forex trade market is the biggest international currency market and the most transparent market all over the nation. Also, just because the forex trade market is decentralized and has no centralized location, the users can trade forex for 24 hours a day from any specific location. Now, one of the most significant benefits of using Bitcoin (BTC) for trading forex is that it is decentralized too, i.e., it has no direct connection with the central authorities or central banking systems. Hence, the currencies are unrestricted from prominent government affairs and macroeconomic problems such as inflation or income taxes. Many forex brokers deliver clout for bitcoin barters as well. Skilled dealers can easily expend this to their usefulness. Nonetheless, such elevated ledges should also be moved toward with enormous vigilance as they heighten the possibility for failures.","In the forex trade market systems, a dealer can commence with an amount as meager as 20 dollars along with some bitcoin forex trading corporations. These forex trading corporations even propose improvements like a similar residue percentage. It’s the dealers’ job to examine that the seller is legal and suitably governed. Abundant forex dealers that ratify cryptocurrency are maintaining brokerage prices relatively low to captivate fresh customers. You don’t have to reveal your real identity or disclose your bank account/credit card info to generate a bitcoin agreement. Therefore, this is a substantial boon in tenures of expenditure and economic safety. Bitcoin pacts have no universal limitations- A dealer from Russia can exchange forex through a dealer in Canada. Administrative provocations may linger to be a trouble, but if both dealers and vendors are inclined to transact, there are no cartographic boundaries what so ever.","Ethereum:","Ethereum (ETH) is the second-most widely used cryptocurrency, which is the price tariff of the Ethereum tallying outlet and is an influential means to exchange. Regardless, it is crucial to trade this cryptocurrency with an adequately specified forex broker. The currency developed by the usage of Ether was recognized as a tremendous craze and extremely abrupt expansion, which even outperformed billion dollars recently. By rewarding or giving payments to those who could give rise to their tallying ability to the hierarchy and as a standard of expenditure under the conventional agreements.","Ethereum has accordingly produced a cryptocurrency that a priori matches the bitcoin because of both established on marketing ascertained by a system and functioning through evidence of analysis, making it reasonable to compensate the miners. Ethereum has no margin and is hence inflationary. It uses a similar algorithm as of now but is more likely to shift to another of the term “proof of stake” for its modern edition “serenity.” Ethereum is mined in approximately 14 seconds. Even though to corroborate a trade, the firms need 30 testimonies for the Ether (unlike only one confirmation for bitcoin), the time needed is less comparatively.","Litecoin","Litecoin (LTC) borrows the Scrypt procedure, which indicates that the makers operating hardware to enable the bitcoin system cannot transition to Litecoin. Therefore, it augments to the decentralized ordeal as the hefty makers cannot handily optimize their revenues by trading. Moreover, they are laboring on faith agreements too. Rapid mining, huge fences, and extra coins in dissemination make it even more susceptible to approval. Litecoin can transfer 23 coins in less than 10 seconds from a hardware wallet, namely Trezor, which has steered to the industries engaging interest in this crypto currency’s improvement and accepting it in their businesses also.","Litecoin’s value has been constant ever since, and it has a less elusive nature as described with Bitcoins. This is one of the major reasons as to why the value does not go like a bat out of hell or decrease so dramatically, and this is a promising aspect for investors willing to use litecoin as a trade currency. It’s a fact worth mentioning that Litecoin carried out modern technologies before Bitcoin did. It can also deal with an elevated quantity of agreements due to its algorithm. Litecoin is shortly evolving for the prime three specks conducting to soar from the established top five specks in the cryptocurrency community."],"create_date":"2023-11-13T08:42:56+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Since hitting mainstream during the COVID pandemic, we’ve witnessed the forming of a dynamic community that throughout the years has found a way to talk with each other and support ideas from many developers. Thanks to the energetic vibe every year is filled with many opportunities perfect for networking by organized crypto events. These few months are no exception with many planned events following, so let’s take a look at these months’ calendar.","The Web3 community will be hosting many events in the field of blockchain this spring. There are tons of already booked reservations by the crypto community, and of course, we will be seeing some crypto experts and celebrities there as well. In these events, we will have an opportunity to take part in debates and panel discussions, where crypto participants will discuss the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies with Crypto influencers and experts from all around the world. With many noteworthy gatherings scheduled for this spring, we’ve chosen a few that we think attending is a must.","One of these events worth giving a visit to is the well-known Southeast Asia Blockchain Week 2024, which will be held from April 29–30 organized by ShardLab and Korea’s leading Web3 VC fund. This event it’s not just an ordinary happening, but it is much more. Here we will have a conference in which the greatest minds, entrepreneurs, and investors from across the globe will be exchanging insights, going through the latest trends in the blockchain digital world and painting the future of the blockchain world. There will be a wide range of topics for this event, but the most popular ones will probably be about innovation in current blockchain networks and the promotion of new projects.","Happening at the same time as Southeast Asia Blockchain Week is the well-known Web3 Dubai event. This summit is a perfect opportunity for both investors and entrepreneurs to dive in and connect with each other. There we will expect to see startups seeking investors for their projects and investors that could be hunting for the biggest innovation of the year and scoring a profit in the long run.","We are thrilled to mention that we’ve also chosen the event in Barcelona in late April. Web3FC and everyone being part of it will be enjoying one of the best cities in the world and one of the most educational events up to date. The reason why it is most educational is simple – there are dozens of educational sessions and workshops planned. During these sessions, crypto enthusiasts will talk directly to the people who have shaped the crypto world in the last decade. Also, when those sessions are over, participants can use their free time for informal networking opportunities with their peers, where good ideas can be born.","When mentioning the best events following this spring, it’s impossible to skip the DC Blockchain Summit 2024 hosted by the Chamber of Digital Commerce. This is an event celebrating blockchain innovation in many fields. The main focus during this conference will be on emerging new technologies, as the topic for this year is “Shaping the Future,”. The future of blockchain is the main topic that will be discussed, making sure to provide the necessary knowledge and awareness following the critical issues that are shaping the future of this industry. It is not every day that you can learn from the best industry experts in the field.","Another event called BlockSplit 2024 awaits on May 27–30. There we will expect to see startups seeking investors for their projects that are capable of funding their ventures, and investors that could be hunting for the biggest innovation of the year and scoring a profit in the long run. Coming from all around the world the array of participants will provide a unique experience for every attendee.","Spring is the perfect season for crypto. We’ve mentioned a couple of really important events, that if you want to stay up-to-date with the crypto world, attending is a must. Regardless if you are professionally exploring cryptocurrencies or just enjoying the excitement that comes with playing some of the best crypto online games, it’s always a bonus getting to know the latest trends in the crypto world. Whether it’s insights on automated cryptocurrency trading or data on the best crash gambling websites at Webopedia, these events pretty much cover it all. Basically, constant learning and improvement lead to perfection, so do not hesitate and check out at least one event this season. So our advice is – don’t wait and level up your crypto experience by attending at least one of these events."],"create_date":"2024-04-29T05:55:56+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

The blockchain system creates a controlled and secure way to invest while considering the fluctuations in the market. In the last decade, the crypto market has been growing exponentially. To date, there are over 10,000 different cryptocurrencies available to explore. This article picks out a few that are likely to do well in the future because of their superior technology than other forms of crypto. They are all relatively new currencies. These are some of the newest coins and tokens in the online market in 2024 to explore:","An anonymous creator made the Shiba Inu Coin in 2020. They named this coin after a breed of dog that originated in the Japanese Chubu region. Shiba Inu is a direct competitor of Dogecoin, built on the Bitcoin blockchain. As a result, it is costly to use. Shiba Inu is based on an existing blockchain that is cheaper to run. Therefore, it is becoming a preferred buying option. It is one of the decentralized cryptocurrencies in the Ethereum network. Shiba Inu has a market capitalization of $19.6 billion. The highest price it has reached is $0.00007957.","","Anatoly Yakovenko created Solana in 2017. He created this crypto on an open-sourced public blockchain part of the Ethereum blockchain. Solana is a blockchain platform for decentralized applications. Importantly, this type of application can work independently. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are an excellent example of this. Furthermore, Solana serves 65,000 transactions per second and is one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization. Solana is the world’s fastest blockchain. It has a market capitalization of 28 billion. Moreover, they can provide faster and cheaper transactions than their competitors. As a result, they prove to be a worthy adversary to Ethereum.","The Golem Factory (a group of investors) launched this crypto in 2016. An Ethereum token allows users to use the Golem protocol to pay for and receive resources. The protocol’s goal is to allow network participants to lend their computer’s extra processing capacity to others. Golem has one billion coins in circulation that participants can exchange on platforms like Binance and KuCoin. Like Solana, it is also part of the Ethereum blockchain. Without a doubt, Golem will increase in value over time. They have envisioned Golem to be a supercomputer that can connect buyers and sellers for a variety of services, including CGI rendering, artificial intelligence, and bitcoin mining. They have a market capitalization of $434, 487, 299. USD.","Evan Duffield launched dash in 2014. This is a system of crypto where you can send money quickly and easily to anyone in the world. Dash created a new digital currency that works similarly to Bitcoin because they built it on the Bitcoin codebase. In addition to this, their transactions take about two and a half minutes on average, which is four times faster than Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time. It has over 10.18 million coins in circulation and has a market cap of $849,097,225. USD. There are many ways to earn money with dash and other cryptocurrencies.","","UNIDO’s token $UDO: it’s the utility token of the UNIDO ecosystem. Unido EP is a multi-signature signing engine, packaged as turnkey wallet solution for crypto users. It allows for the fast set up of custody wallets that require more than one approval to process a transaction.","The token is the core of Unido EP. First, $UDO will be used to pay fees when using the UNIDO platform which goes to the treasury and fuels more development. Second, to access the UNIDO platform a user must stake $UDO. Third, decision power as UNIDO will roll out DAO governance in stages and $UDO will be used for voting power. Fourth, access to liquidity mining rewards.","“A store of value with a burn rate of 90% of tax fees. Enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitgesell uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.” This project have combined the concept of “freigeld” and gold as traditional store of value and demurrage works in reverse (not the way it was used for currency but for gold) adding more properties of digital gold through gradually increasing scarcity over time. Could you imagine gold which volume in existence is gradually decreasing over time? Code is widely based on bitcoin code, so it is stable and reliable.","Website: https://Bitgesell.ca","","“The mission of Shiba’s Wife is clear; support for women with violated rights around the world. There is a Wallet dedicated only to women with violated rights.

The Orbs protocol is decentralized and executed by a public network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus.","Orbs unique features designed for interoperability with EVM-compatible blockchains, together with its decentralized network of nodes, allow it to be set up as a separate execution layer (“L3” ) operating to enhance the capabilities of EVM smart contracts. By working in conjunction with other L1 and L2 solutions as part of a tiered blockchain stack, Orbs opens up a whole new spectrum of possibilities for DeFi, NFT, Metaverse and GameFi.","Orbs was founded in 2017 and launched its mainnet and token in March of 2019. Orbs is being developed by a dedicated team of more than 30 people, with offices in Tel Aviv, London, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul.","For more information, please visit www.orbs.com, or join Orb’s community at:","Telegram: https://t.me/OrbsNetwork Twitter: https://twitter.com/orbs_network","","Coreto, the first layer of trust in the crypto space, revolutionizes how content creators, market analysts, traders, and newcomers interact with crypto projects through simple and efficient navigation.

They did this to make the coins more scarce, provide more benefits to investors, and increase the currency’s price. Binance Coin (BNB) receives 5%. BNB is a currency that the coin’s creators own. This token has a 10% fee on transactions: Other token holders receive a fraction of the redistributed 5%."],"create_date":"2024-04-25T06:37:57+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

A Complete Guide | CryptoRunner","content":["22 September, 2022 by Guest Post","Cryptocurrencies have the potential to reshape the financial world – making it more inclusive, efficient, and secure. They could also help reduce poverty in many parts of the world by providing a way for people to store and transfer money without having to rely on banks or other financial institutions.","However, cryptocurrencies are still in their early stages of development and there is a lot of volatility in prices. The problem may be avoided by using a coin price tracker like CoinStats. Instant price alerts, a news aggregator, military-grade encryption, and an easy-to-use dashboard to keep track of all your crypto and DeFi assets in one spot are just a few of the features offered by the portfolio tracker.","The earliest cryptocurrency to be invented was Bitcoin (BTC) which was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. BTC is often considered the first decentralized cryptocurrency, as it was not created or backed by any government or financial institution. Other popular cryptocurrencies include Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ripple (XRP).","The most significant difference between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies is that a cryptocurrency can be used anywhere, while a fiat currency can only be used in the country where it was issued.","Another key difference is that cryptocurrencies are not regulated by governments, while fiat currencies are. This means that cryptocurrencies are not subject to inflation or other economic factors that can affect fiat currencies.","Cryptocurrencies also have a limited supply, while fiat currencies do not. This is because the supply of cryptocurrencies is determined by the code that creates them, while the supply of fiat currencies is determined by central banks.","The elements that influence the cost of cryptocurrency might vary from the scope of cryptocurrency use today to future uses of bitcoin coins and a variety of other connected aspects falling within the cryptocurrency environment’s development. Here are some reasons for the fluctuation in cryptocurrency prices.","When the value of fiat money decreases, the price of a cryptocurrency goes up in relation to that currency. This happens because you can get more cryptocurrencies with your blockchain technology than you could with the same amount of fiat currency before inflation. For example, if the US dollar inflates, then you would need more US dollars to buy the same amount of Bitcoin than you would have needed before the inflation.","The crypto market is mostly dominated by the big whales, who can single-handedly manipulate the market. When they sell their assets in large numbers, the price of Bitcoin falls, and when they buy assets in large numbers, the price of Bitcoin rises.","This technology has the potential to revolutionize the market through cryptocurrency prices and bitcoin walletdevelopment costs.","One way that huge cryptocurrency investors often called “whales”, inflate prices is through a technique called rinse and repeat trading. Under this approach, the whale begins selling their crypto at lower than market value, causing small-time traders to panic and sell off their own holdings.","The limited amount of cryptocurrencies creates a sense of urgency to buy them, resulting in people buying cryptocurrencies at high prices. This is because they think that the price of the cryptocurrency will continue to rise due to the limited supply.","When the demand for a cryptocurrency is greater than the available supply, the price of the cryptocurrency increases. This happens because people are willing to pay more for cryptocurrency in order to get their hands on it.","There is no cryptocurrency that is better than the other one. Hence, it comes with the best preference that the investor decides to invest in. However, the gospel truth is that Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. However, the investor should think about the risk that a certain coin has and if he will be able to withstand the volatility that comes with it. There are a lot of wallets in the market and each has its own purpose. The most important thing is for you to understand what you need before investing in any cryptocurrency.","Irreversible transactions are one of the inconveniences of using fiat currencies. Once you make a transaction with fiat currencies, there is no way to cancel or reverse it. In any given situation when you use a cryptocurrency, you need to give affirmation before the occurrence of transactions. Before you finalize any cryptocurrency transaction, it is crucial that you take responsibility and confirm the details of the transaction.","The security of a cryptocurrency is essential. Cryptocurrencies use various techniques to ensure the confidentiality and security of transactions. Hence, every owner of a digital currency has a unique key that only he or she can use to access their funds.","Cryptocurrencies are also often used as a way to secure transactions. When you make a transaction with a cryptocurrency, the transaction details are encrypted and stored on the blockchain. This makes it very difficult for anyone to hack into the system and steal any information.","Cryptocurrencies are superfast regardless of the location. Once you initiate a transaction, it is quickly caught by the network, and it is affirmed within minutes. Most of the time, cryptocurrency transactions are confirmed within a short period of time.","Cryptocurrencies have the potential to revolutionize the market. They are digital assets that are not subject to the whims of central banks or governments. Cryptocurrencies are also frequently used as a way to secure transactions and ensure confidentiality. They are superfast and have the potential to change the way we interact with the financial system. Although cryptocurrency prices keep on changing from time to time, the firm is growing rapidly.","With the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there is a growing interest in cryptocurrency investing. Cryptocurrency investing is a relatively new phenomenon, and there is still a lot of uncertainty about how it works and what the potential risks are. One of the biggest concerns about cryptocurrency investing is the possibility that large investors, often called “whales”, could manipulate the market.","The most important thing for potential investors to remember is that they should only invest what they are willing to lose. Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and can rise and fall a great deal in a short period of time."],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

The information provided is not directed at or intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity located within the UK. The financial products and services mentioned in this article are not eligible for the UK. Cryptoassets are classified as Restricted Mass Market Investments in the UK, meaning that they are high-risk investments and are not suitable for most retail investors.","In the world of cryptocurrency, one fundamental aspect that sets it apart is the irreversibility of transactions. Bintense, a prominent player in the online crypto exchange arena with expertise, knowledge, and authority in the crypto domain, stands as a beacon in providing insights into why crypto transactions remain irreversible.","The cornerstone of irreversibility in crypto transactions lies within the blockchain technology powering it. Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralised and distributed ledgers, where transactions are bundled into blocks and linked chronologically. Once a block is added to the blockchain, altering any transaction within becomes computationally infeasible due to the cryptographic hash functions and consensus mechanisms, supporting immutability.","Cryptographic techniques in blockchain technology play a pivotal role in ensuring the integrity of transactions. Each transaction is verified through complex mathematical algorithms, creating a digital signature that uniquely identifies the parties involved. Attempting to alter a transaction would require recalculating the cryptographic hash for that specific block and all subsequent blocks, rendering it practically impossible.","Decentralisation, a key feature of cryptocurrencies, minimises the reliance on central authorities. Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), checks that participants agree on the validity of transactions. This distributed consensus makes it challenging for any single entity to reverse or manipulate transactions without the majority’s approval.","Understanding the irreversibility of crypto transactions is not just a matter for tech enthusiasts or industry experts; it holds profound significance for everyday users engaging in crypto for common daily needs. Here’s why this knowledge is crucial:","For users making routine purchases or transactions using cryptocurrencies, knowing that these transactions are irreversible adds a layer of double-check. In the fast-paced world of digital transactions, mistakes can happen. Knowing that crypto transactions are irreversible prompts users to pay extra attention to details before confirming, reducing the likelihood of accidental errors that could have financial consequences.","Many individuals use cryptocurrencies for peer-daily needs such as buying/selling goods or services. Sellers can be confident that it cannot be rescinded once a payment is made, promoting fair exchanges. The immutability provided by blockchain technology limits chances for unauthorised actions and fraud.","As cryptocurrencies become more integrated into daily life, users must adopt a sense of financial responsibility. Acknowledging the permanence of crypto transactions encourages users to manage their digital assets prudently, fostering a proactive and informed approach to personal finance.","In essence, whether buying your morning coffee, selling items online, or engaging in routine financial transactions, knowing why crypto transactions are irreversible empowers you to navigate the crypto landscape confidently and securely in your daily life. Intense stands as your partner for a seamless online exchange experience. With Bintense, you can exchange crypto for fiat money and back.

The technology is the basis for cryptocurrencies as it allows for fast transfers and clear records that prevent mistakes and erroneous transfers.","In this article, we’ll go over the most important blockchain protocols that investors should be aware of and how they differ. The basic technology behind all of them is the same, but there are different uses, leading the crypto protocols to find quite distinct user bases. An investor, however, should look into the whole field and diversify their investment by both use and value.","Bitcoin is the first and the largest cryptocurrency out there. It’s the gold standard for the industry and the first cryptocurrency that has gone truly mainstream and was accepted by traditional financial institutions, such as banks and ETFs.","However, traditional financial institutions have also criticized one of the features of its protocol – how decentralized it is. For some users, however, the fact that no centralized institution controls Bitcoin is the whole point.","The Bitcoin network uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. It requires the users to provide computation power to the network and validate transactions while providing security.","Ethereum is the second-largest crypto protocol and has managed to find its way to traditional financial markets and create its own ETFs. Ethereum network is especially well-designed to run and build applications based on smart contracts.","Smart contracts have found their application and use in almost every industry, as they allow automated transfers and self-executing arrangements. For complex industries with a lot of moving parts, such as logistics and shipping, smart contracts enable the users to send the payments when each point of the process is completed. It reduces loss and makes the process smoother.","Binance is a blockchain network launched by the crypto exchange of the same name. It’s one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, measured by the amount of funds traded and the number of cryptos that use it.","This protocol allows for transferring large amounts of data within a short time. This makes the network very scalable and allows it to grow. It’s a key feature now when there’s a wide crypto adoption. Proof of stake is also much more energy efficient than the alternative proof-of-work.","Cardano is a blockchain platform mostly used for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It’s based on the proof-of-stake mechanism called Ouroboros. A mechanism such as this allows the users to validate their transactions simply by holding and using their tokens.","It’s the most energy-efficient protocol out there and, therefore, the most eco-friendly. It’s one of the most important features for crypto users who are tech-savvy and otherwise care for their carbon footprint. Cardano also uses a modular architecture that allows it to change and adapt to new apps.","Polcadot is a unique protocol that focuses on multi-chain uses. The network is built for interoperability between different blockchain systems. Users see this feature as one that’s oriented towards simplicity and ease of use. There are plenty of blockchain networks in use, and investors and everyday users are looking for the ability to transfer funds between different blockchains.","This is done using a security model that works equally well regardless of which blockchain is used. It’s a smaller protocol but one that will expand in the years to come as the need for multi-chain transfers becomes more important.","Solana has one of the most powerful proofs of stake protocols. It allows for thousands of transactions per second to be processed at any time. With the new interest in crypto and wide adoption, such platforms are much needed, and they gain new users every day.","Solana is also a crypto protocol that places special emphasis on developer adoption. It provides several tools and resources to help developers build on the platform. The network uses both proof of stake and proof of history consensus mechanisms. It’s an innovative mechanism developed by Solana Hub.","Chainlink is what’s called an Oracle network that is somewhat similar to Bitcoin. Oracle systems connect data from the outside world (off-chain) with the blockchain world (on-chain). It uses the data to supply smart contracts with a wide array of information. Data includes weather reports and predictions, stock prices, and public ledgers. All of these are used to inform financial decisions.","For a while, users have been trying to utilize the automation that comes with using blockchain networks to process a lot of information at once quickly. The network is built on Ethereum and utilizes zero-knowledge proof.","Cosmos is a decentralized network that uses independent blockchains. It enables easy transfer of assets and information between different blockchains. The network provides a common security network with a shared security model. The transactions made using this protocol are safe and secure.","Cosmos is especially well-liked in the industry that focuses on decentralized finance projects. Cosmos focuses on scalability and interoperability, which are the features that are most needed in the world of decentralized finance. The Cosmos exchange platform has a coin called Atom. It’s on the rise, as is the case with most altcoins, but it’s not widely used.","Tron is a decentralized crypto platform that’s used to create decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ethereum is the most popular crypto in this field, but there are many altcoins on the rise that work based on the same principles and provide a unique service. Tron is one such altcoin that focuses on the entertainment industry applications. It was first based on Ethereum, and in 2018, it switched to its own network.","It’s a platform on which content creators can publish, store, and monetize their digital content. The creators can use a crypto coin called TRX to make payments and the Tron blockchain to automate payments.","Hive is a blockchain protocol that uses a design similar to that of decentralized social media. It allows for fast and safe transactions. It also features a strong community of creators and curators. Hive is focused on community collaboration and engagement among users.","The network uses proof of stake, which means that it uses ownership of coins to verify transactions and networking. It often calls itself a cryptocurrency for Web 3, and it’s made for decentralized networks and smart contracts. The HIVE crypto itself isn’t among the most widely used coins.","There are many different crypto protocols out there that investors should be aware of. The rise and wide adoption of cryptocurrencies have also led to increased interest in smaller and niche altcoins. Now, when traditional finance institutions use Bitcoin and Ethereum, they are also getting a spotlight.","When investors are looking for cryptos to focus on, they should look for something more than price and value. How a protocol is used and what market it covers are also important indicators of how sound the investment is."],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}
{"url":"https://cryptorunner.com/news/crypto-casinos-around-the-globe/#respond","web_url":"https://cryptorunner.com/news/","type":"article","description":"Crypto casinos are making a lot of buzz around the world.","title":"Crypto Casinos Around the Globe | CryptoRunner","content":["22 September, 2022 by Guest Post","When the first crypto casinos appeared, millions of players were wary of them. Only the most advanced took the risk of gambling with the still unpopular, but gaining momentum, digital currency. It is worth noting that operators were also taking a big risk by opening such establishments. No one could understand how the cryptocurrency worked, especially with its ever-evolving exchange rate. The future of both the underlying currency and the operator itself also seemed elusive. However, it turned out that all these fears were unfounded. Europe has long appreciated the cryptocurrency’s functionality, and other markets are starting to pick up on it at a rapid pace. In Asian countries, for example, there is a growing trend for players and land-based casinos to use cryptocurrency.","Over the years, cryptocurrency has shown its effectiveness in online casinos, so the number of participants has grown by thousands of times. If you’re not one of them yet, there are at least six reasons why you should become familiar with crypto casinos and their games:","More generous bonuses. Generous bonuses are famous for any crypto casino. Due to the lack of monetary service fees from financial institutions (participation in blockchain is free), this allows operators to reward players to a greater extent than would be possible in standard establishments.","All of this has contributed to what is now known – almost every operator in the gambling club network has establishments in which payments can be made in cryptocurrency. In addition, people from all over the world can play with this unique currency.","Cryptocurrency has made its way into the lives and fortunes of players, but the licensing regulators do not always agree. Even though there is such a thing as no verification casino in USA, there is still no consensus among authorities on digital currencies, including within online casinos. Some states approve of their use, others strongly oppose their use in online casinos. The reason is the existence of legal acts prohibiting the use of risky assets. Cryptocurrency fully fits this concept.","Recently, there has been some movement in this area. some states have started to waive this rule in order to make up for the budget. In any case, if the rules of the operator themselves allow you to register with a cryptocurrency casino, you will be allowed access anyway. The main thing is to buy cryptocurrency, register with a reliable casino and play.","UKGC, while not the first regulator to notice the convenience of cryptocurrencies in online casinos, is already appreciating its possibilities. The GC, which is responsible for issuing licenses to operators, is very strict about enforcing the rule of law and players’ rights. The latest legislative innovations will start controlling cryptocurrency players more strongly than before, requiring them to undergo verification. On the one hand, the validity of the claim that cryptocurrency is anonymous is lost. On the other hand, it is not to control casino visitors, but to combat fraud and money laundering via blockchain.","When choosing a crypto casino with a UKGC license, the player chooses security. One of the main requirements for operators is to provide absolute security for both the website itself and the blockchain platforms. This increases the reliability of transactions many times over. Any UK online casino is available on all existing devices with internet access. This makes gambling even more popular because it is now closer than ever.","The UKGC regulates all types of gambling in online casinos – video slots, table games, card games, lotteries, sports betting, bingo, keno. Whatever games are present on the operator’s website, the player should stick to the rules of responsible gaming, and the casino itself should take maximum action on its part to ensure that only users with a serious approach to gambling can play. Even if you play anonymously with cryptocurrency, you should understand how important it is to have control over yourself and your money.","The gambling industry in Canada is friendly to all existing casinos – land-based, online and even crypto casinos. This is not surprising, as the payment of taxes by the operators does not make the Canadian treasury feel deficient. That said, it should be understood that each province has its own general laws that apply to crypto casinos as well. The player’s task is to understand them on their own and not to violate the rules concerning their interests and obligations. Whichever crypto casino you choose for that country, the most important thing is to find a reliable establishment with a license. This will fully protect you from unfair actions from the casino administration.","Gambling has been legal in Australia in most states since 2001. Only one state is still on the defensive about legalising gambling. However, according to a survey, this state has the support of ⅔ of the country’s population. They are in favor of a complete ban on gambling, both land-based and online. Speaking out against advertising they are, however, not against playing in online casinos. This is also honestly stated by more than half of the adult respondents.","Not every online club accepts crypto payments. There can be many nuances to the reasons, but the most real ones seem to be personal distrust of digital currencies by operators and the policy of using traditional currencies. Regardless, there is absolutely no shortage of gaming sites to choose from. More and more casino owners are paying attention to this rapidly growing market, while adjusting to the demands of modern players."],"create_date":"2022-09-22T08:39:22+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Modern consumers and companies don’t prefer cash payments. Instead, they prefer contactless payments. More people are also using smartphones, and this has prompted companies to accept mobile and internet transactions. And the emergency of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has made things more interesting.","Today, almost everybody wants to buy, sell, or invest in Bitcoin. And you can attribute this to the growing popularity of this digital currency. Bitcoin was the first electronic currency to go mainstream. Although other digital currencies emerged afterward, Bitcoin remains the most popular among them. Currently, the world has over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and developers are creating more. Unfortunately, some people invest in electronic currencies without understanding how they work.","Bitcoin is an electronic payment system and money that does not depend on third parties like banks. Instead, this virtual currency provides a peer-to-peer system, allowing people to receive or send money from any part of the world. Rather than use physical cash, people send bitcoins online using their computers and smartphones. A public ledger records transaction details when a person transfers funds.","Electronic money developers gave it the name cryptocurrency because it verifies transactions using encryption. That means transmitting and storing cryptocurrency data involves advanced coding. People can store Bitcoin in digital wallets and access transaction data in public ledgers. The encryption involved in cryptocurrency provides safety and security.","But like other investments, Bitcoin comes with risks. Some experts say that Bitcoin presents a riskier investment because of its price volatility. But this virtual currency is among the hottest commodities to invest in today. If planning to venture into Bitcoin investments, here are safety tips to guide you.","Most people access Bitcoin through crypto exchanges. Platforms allow people to purchase and sell this electronic currency with ease. You can pay for Bitcoin with fiat money using different payment methods. Upon buying your Bitcoin, you can transfer it to your digital wallet and use it to pay for services and goods.","But, crypto exchanges are not the same. That’s why you should exercise caution when purchasing Bitcoin. Ideally, research a cryptocurrency exchange before registering and using it to buy or sell Bitcoin. Read reviews to gain insights into what other users say about a platform before you use it to purchase Bitcoin using your hard-earned money.","Although you can keep Bitcoin in a crypto exchange, a digital wallet provides safer storage. That’s because a cryptocurrency exchange doesn’t prioritize safety. Instead, it aims to help you buy and sell Bitcoin with ease. A digital wallet, on the other hand, provides a safe place for storing Bitcoin. However, you can choose from a wide range of wallets, and each has its pros and cons. Take your time to research different digital wallets to select the most appropriate based on your needs.","Bitcoin has a highly volatile market. Therefore, prepare for this volatility when starting to invest in this electronic currency. Prices will exhibit dramatic swings. So, if your mental wellbeing or portfolio can’t withstand this volatility, Bitcoin may not be a suitable investment for you.","Bitcoin has captured the attention of many retail investors. Almost everybody with access to the internet is thinking about investing in this digital currency. That’s because early adopters are constantly sharing their success stories. But safety is a significant concern for most people that want to invest in this virtual currency. Following these tips will enable you to participate in Bitcoin trading or investing without losing your hard-earned money.

Since hitting mainstream during the COVID pandemic, we’ve witnessed the forming of a dynamic community that throughout the years has found a way to talk with each other and support ideas from many developers. Thanks to the energetic vibe every year is filled with many opportunities perfect for networking by organized crypto events. These few months are no exception with many planned events following, so let’s take a look at these months’ calendar.","The Web3 community will be hosting many events in the field of blockchain this spring. There are tons of already booked reservations by the crypto community, and of course, we will be seeing some crypto experts and celebrities there as well. In these events, we will have an opportunity to take part in debates and panel discussions, where crypto participants will discuss the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies with Crypto influencers and experts from all around the world. With many noteworthy gatherings scheduled for this spring, we’ve chosen a few that we think attending is a must.","One of these events worth giving a visit to is the well-known Southeast Asia Blockchain Week 2024, which will be held from April 29–30 organized by ShardLab and Korea’s leading Web3 VC fund. This event it’s not just an ordinary happening, but it is much more. Here we will have a conference in which the greatest minds, entrepreneurs, and investors from across the globe will be exchanging insights, going through the latest trends in the blockchain digital world and painting the future of the blockchain world. There will be a wide range of topics for this event, but the most popular ones will probably be about innovation in current blockchain networks and the promotion of new projects.","Happening at the same time as Southeast Asia Blockchain Week is the well-known Web3 Dubai event. This summit is a perfect opportunity for both investors and entrepreneurs to dive in and connect with each other. There we will expect to see startups seeking investors for their projects and investors that could be hunting for the biggest innovation of the year and scoring a profit in the long run.","We are thrilled to mention that we’ve also chosen the event in Barcelona in late April. Web3FC and everyone being part of it will be enjoying one of the best cities in the world and one of the most educational events up to date. The reason why it is most educational is simple – there are dozens of educational sessions and workshops planned. During these sessions, crypto enthusiasts will talk directly to the people who have shaped the crypto world in the last decade. Also, when those sessions are over, participants can use their free time for informal networking opportunities with their peers, where good ideas can be born.","When mentioning the best events following this spring, it’s impossible to skip the DC Blockchain Summit 2024 hosted by the Chamber of Digital Commerce. This is an event celebrating blockchain innovation in many fields. The main focus during this conference will be on emerging new technologies, as the topic for this year is “Shaping the Future,”. The future of blockchain is the main topic that will be discussed, making sure to provide the necessary knowledge and awareness following the critical issues that are shaping the future of this industry. It is not every day that you can learn from the best industry experts in the field.","Another event called BlockSplit 2024 awaits on May 27–30.

Yes, we are talking about none other than PayPal, which is touted as the Goliath of online payment in today’s time.","Since its inception back in 1998, PayPal quickly rose into fame and donned the crown of one of the most promising digital payment platforms and service providers at an international level. Not only in the field of finance, this company carved a niche for itself in the iGaming industry as well.","Since then PayPal has been embraced by a number of online casinos, thereby solidifying its stature and prominence as a reliable ally for the gaming aficionados and pulling up the overall stock prices.","But lately, things are looking haywire for PayPal as the company is slowly slipping out in terms of overall market share and payment volume, thereby infusing strong tension amongst the investors.","But is it just another story concocted about investment jitters and market volatility or something more alarming looming in the air? If things are taking a bad turn for PayPal, what should be the company’s strategy to escape this problem? Let’s try to find out more in this post below.","The stage is all set for PayPal and the dark cloud of woe and worry have surrounded the investors of this company, which was once hailed as undisputed king in the financial market.","The last quarter hasn’t been good and it has shaken the investment space with varying shifts in price, with clouds of uncertainty, which in turn is causing the investors’ hearts to come to their mouths. Recently, the fourth quarter results were declared and it thoroughly disappointed the investors.","PayPal has been experiencing the rage of the market since 2023, and it showed the early symptoms of the decline. But what is the reason for this downturn? In this very year, the figures of the company were hampered by slow revenue growth, bad leadership and less than expected profits. There were frequent changes in the leadership which in turn jolted the business while the rise in stiff competition and regulatory challenges de-accelerated the sales growth.","The doubts in the minds of investors intensified during the market sentiment downturn. This in turn led to the re-assessment of PayPal’s place in the fintech ecosystem. While the financial reports of 2023 were far from average, PayPal started investing its energy and focus in building innovation and improving operational excellence, which was evident in the last quarter’s report.","The moves in PayPal’s share in recent quarters have added a pinch of tension among the investors. While the company’s quarter-four results could not satisfy its profit appetite, the results are somewhere fine. It hints that PayPal is working internally to resolve the root causes of its decline, paving the way to a better future. However, with such a slow growth rate, it will definitely take a bit longer to return to the roads of stability.","Despite the storm of uncertainty surrounding PayPal Holdings Inc., its latest financial reports offer a glimpse of hope for investors. The reports highlight a 9% pull in revenue to $8 billion in the fourth quarter, crushing expectations of $7.33 billion.","While the outer figures look super promising, the problem lies under the surface. The flat transaction margin of $3.7 billion points to slower growth, which turned out to be the reason to snatch away the smiles of the investors. The more haunting factor is the decline of active accounts by 2% to 426 million.","Finally, the investors can enjoy a breath of relief with the new CEO, Alex Chriss, stepping into the spotlight and unwrapping the next move of PayPal. With 2024 set as an investment and transition year, the company intends to launch new projects and strengthen its core technology infrastructure, particularly by solving latency concerns on its mobile app. Chriss’s vision lays the groundwork for a profitable future by polishing the company’s offerings.","The world of fintech and digital payments has been experiencing enormous growth in recent years. But PayPal has significantly failed to walk in parallel with this market, squeezing out big profits. PayPal presently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 11, indicating that Wall Street is particularly pessimistic about the company’s growth prospects.","But amidst the chaos and speculation, there is always a window of opportunity for PayPal to rewrite the narrative and reclaim its position in the industry. With a new leader in the driving seat, an unrelenting drive, and a dose of luck, PayPal may still rise from the shadows and into the sunshine again."],"create_date":"2024-04-23T16:11:14+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

This integration has propelled not only a technological shift but also a reevaluation of what privacy and security mean in the digital gambling domain. As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum become commonplace, their adoption in online betting offers a glimpse into a future where transactions are faster, privacy is inherent, and regulatory frameworks are challenged. This article will explore the mechanics, advantages, and broader implications of crypto gambling, positioning it as a potentially transformative force in online betting.","The journey of online betting began in the mid-1990s when the internet became commercially accessible, leading to the establishment of the first online casinos. These platforms initially offered basic versions of traditional casino games. However, the sector evolved rapidly with advancements in internet technology and secure digital payment systems, which broadened the scope and appeal of online betting. The introduction of online poker platforms marked a significant milestone, creating a global poker community and reshaping the way poker was played.","Platforms such as GGPoker exemplify the integration of complex software solutions that cater to user preferences and ensure secure and fair play. The evolution from simple web-based casinos to sophisticated platforms capable of handling millions of transactions daily illustrates the sector’s significant growth and the increasing trust and interest from the general public.","Crypto gambling leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to offer a gambling experience that is both transparent and secure. Unlike traditional online casinos that rely on external and often opaque payment processors, crypto casinos use blockchain to directly handle deposits, bets, and withdrawals. This system inherently records all transactions on a distributed ledger, offering an unprecedented level of transaction transparency and auditability. Furthermore, the use of smart contracts automates the betting and payout processes, minimizing human intervention and the associated risk of manipulation.","Crypto casinos often operate with a significantly lower overhead due to fewer regulatory and compliance costs, allowing for more competitive odds and lower house edges. This technological framework not only enhances the security and efficiency of online betting but also opens new avenues for user engagement and retention by promoting fairness and trust.","Crypto gambling stands at a pivotal juncture between technological innovation and widespread acceptance. Platforms like GGPoker exemplify the potential of this industry to not only provide enhanced gaming experiences but also to reshape how online betting is perceived and regulated. As challenges such as regulatory uncertainties and market volatility are addressed, the future of crypto gambling looks promising, with the potential to offer more secure, private, and accessible betting options than ever before.",""],"create_date":"2024-05-14T12:21:25+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

What hardware do I need?","title":"What is Ethereum Mining and How to Start Mining ETH | CryptoRunner","content":["8 June, 2022 by Guest Post","The first thing to know about Ethereum mining is that, unlike Bitcoin, you do not need to spend thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars on a dedicated mining computer that can do nothing else and is quickly outdated. A good gaming rig will do it.","The second thing to know about mining Ethereum is that it’s about to change.","An upgrade called Ethereum 2.0 is in the works, and will go live in phases over the next couple of years. The Ethereum blockchain will switch from a Bitcoin-style Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to a more eco-friendly alternative known as Proof-of-Stake.","The good news is that — for now it remains possible to mine ETH as a “little guy.” But for now… how does Ethereum mining work?","Your first question might be: what is Ethereum mining for? Well, the purpose is twofold.","The key purpose of mining is to add new transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. Every time ETH is sent to a new address, that transaction is sent to a holding area so it can be included in an upcoming block. This is then added to the end of Ethereum’s immutable, and unchangeable, blockchain.","Ethereum miners vie for the right to create that block, which essentially means gathering a set number of transactions, putting them in order, and then uploading that information.","In exchange, the miner selected to write a new block — which happens about every 13 seconds — earns several rewards.","The most important of these rewards is creating a number of new ETH as a reward for winning the race to “mine” the next block. But on 1 December 2021, a “difficulty bomb” will eliminate this over a few months, paving the way for Ethereum 2.0.","Miners also earn transaction fees. This is the “gas” paid by users for each transaction. Originally, the biggest gas fee offered was put on the blockchain first. Ethereum price were volatile and often skyhigh — and when Ethereum became congested as DeFi and NFTs grew in popularity, too little gas could mean big delays.","Now, there is a set fee that fluctuates based on how congested the blockchain is. However, part of that fee — which used to go entirely to the miner — is now used to burn existing ETH. As an alternative, those making payments can “tip” miners to ensure their transactions are bumped up the list and added to the blockchain first.","The changes coming with the switch to Ethereum 2.0 go far beyond how miners — who will be renamed “stakers” — earn rewards.","Proof-of-Work is a flat-out race, a sprint to see who can be the first to solve a mathematical problem. Brute power wins.","On the other hand, Proof-of-Stake can be thought of as putting up a bond for good behaviour. To run a full node, you’ll need to lock 32 ETH or join a mining pool.","Instead of miners, stakers are generally called validators — they are confirming the transactions before putting them into a new block. Under PoS, the node selected to create the new block is randomly selected based on the size of their stake.","So… how does Ethereum mining work? First off, you’ll need a mining rig. These can be specialised ASIC machines that do nothing else and can be expensive.","Unlike Bitcoin, you can mine Ethereum with a good gaming rig — they cost $1,000 to $4,000 as of late 2021 — and remember the graphics card is key. Also, look at the cost of power in your area.","Assuming you’re not going to buy a specialised Ethereum ASIC miner, you’ve got to join a mining pool.","How to start mining Ethereum on your PC is fairly straightforward. First off, know that mining software is specific to your computer, operating system, graphics card — Nvidia, AMD, etc. — and supported by your pool. Don’t make looking for software an afterthought to buying a new PC.","Second, look at the hashrate, but also know that what software makers claim isn’t always what pools report.","Third, know that this software can be complex — many run on Linux.","The biggest is to dramatically increase what’s called scalability — or how many transactions per second the Ethereum blockchain can handle. Currently, it can support about 30 TPS. Ethereum 2.0 promises up to 100,000 TPS. This is key as Ethereum cannot handle the current demands of DeFi and NFTs, which are set to grow exponentially in coming years.","One facet of PoS is that the stake you put up will be slashed — meaning you’ll be fined — for malicious actions, but also for problems like downtime. So reliable power and a battery backup will become far more important.","Next is that Ethereum will stop sucking down so much electricity that it is an actual global warming threat. As of October 2021, it uses as much as the whole of New Zealand. Proof-of-Stake’s energy consumption is negligible.","All in all, how to mine Ethereum is changing. It’ll be better for Ethereum users. But for miners — soon to be validators — the rewards look likely to fall."],"create_date":"2022-06-08T14:26:02+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

As the name suggests, its plan is to go safely to the moon and make holders (HODLers) generate huge profits. Its trading tax serves as an incentive to HODL SafeMoon tokens as long as possible, and it may as well increase its potential in the long run. SafeMoon also has a burning policy, where tokens are constantly burned. A lower supply often leads to a price increase.","While its price is relatively low due to the large supply, experts predict that the price of SAFEMOON can increase at large rates in the future. Here is what some of them think.","YouTuber Kyle Talks Money provides a careful analysis of SafeMoon (SAFEMOON) and how it works. He suggests that SafeMoon does not necessarily need to have an increase in the market cap for its price to increase at large rates. His implication is based on the argument that SAFEMOON tokens are constantly burned. By penalizing sellers and rewarding sellers, the total supply of SafeMoon is decreasing. As a result, its price increases without necessarily increasing the market cap. Therefore, a price of $0.01 is entirely possible for SafeMoon in the long run.","Mr. Bon’s also provides his analysis on SafeMoon (SAFEMOON). He calculates the time that you would need to become a millionaire with $100 of SafeMoon investment by taking into account SafeMoon’s burning rate. Based on his calculations, SafeMoon could reach $0.01 in the next ten years.","Crytonic predicts that SafeMoon can increase in the next five years, but not at very large rates. They believe that by 2025, SafeMoon can hit a price of around $0.00002, which is 10x the current price of SAFEMOON. However, they believe that by 2030, SafeMoon can go close to $1, especially if more than 30% of the total supply is burned by then.","Wjsnews gives another prediction on SafeMoon. They predict that SAFEMOON can be as high as $0.63 by 2030. By 2040, they believe that SAFEMOON can surpass $1 and reach as high as $1.85. Lastly, they predict that a price of $10 is only attainable by 2050 for SAFEMOON.","Crypto Academy gives a detailed analysis and prediction on SafeMoon for the next four years. They predict that the price of SafeMoon can reach up to $0.00005 in this bullish cycle. As for 2022, a price of $0.0001 is possible due to the upcoming projects that SafeMoon has. With its deflationary properties due to the burning mechanism, SAFEMOON could aim for $0.0007 in 2023. Decentralized Applications (DApps), as well as decentralized gaming, can put SafeMoon higher in the market rankings, as its price is predicted to go close to $0.003. Last but not least, they predict that by 2025, SAFEMOON can reach a price of $0.01 as the demand increases and as the BTC halving in 2024 takes full effect in the market."],"create_date":"2021-10-22T13:00:36+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

The rise of Ethereum, as well as networks focused on smart contracts, further extended the scope of this technology. Over the years, advances in the development of decentralized apps attracted new investors and users to the ecosystem.","Cryptocurrencies were not only a store of value or means of exchange anymore. The decentralized and perpetually available nature of blockchains allowed for the creation of marketplaces, virtual spaces, etc.","The number of possibilities boosted the growth of the sector. For this reason, analysts estimate that the blockchain technology market will be worth over 39 billion USD by 2025. Besides, almost one-third of this value will be invested in the banking sector. To access DApps, investors only need to buy Ethereum at an exchange and start participating in the crypto community.","Ethereum’s blockchain, the second-largest by market value, hosts the majority of dApps in the ecosystem. So, it requires a high throughput to process a large number of users. While this has been an issue in the past, Ethereum developers are working to improve and scale the network.","The road to scale the Ethereum network marked a major milestone with the transition from PoW to PoS mining. This reduced the fees charged by the network and the time it took users to wait for their transactions to be settled. But Ethereum still has room to improve, and it must do it to stay ahead of the competition. So, now developers are planning on implementing an upgrade known as The Purge.","This upgrade focuses on simplifying the Ethereum network. This feature, however, will not compromise decentralization. Instead, it will deepen it, by redistributing the history of the blockchain across different node groups. This is similar to the sharding process implemented on other blockchains.","To declutter the network, the upgrade will allow nodes to process transactions from checkpoints. This, in exchange, reduces the impact of the process on the devices of validator nodes. The Purge will also benefit nodes by removing fragments of code that remain from PoW mining. These are no longer necessary on PoS. The proposal also aims to improve smart contracts, by optimizing their codebase.","Ethereum is a very popular network for creating applications. These five crypto projects on Ethereum are used around the world, and there are a lot more with huge user bases. So it is important to create a functional network for them.","The goal of The Purge, as we said, is to optimize the network by reducing the historical data and streamlining the code bases. Let’s review how these features are implemented in detail.","In general, upgrades to the Ethereum network have been well received by the community. As a result of the congestion and scaling issues that took place in recent years, investors and developers have been eager to implement beneficial changes on the blockchain. These hard forks have been adopted by all nodes, and they have not resulted in network splits.","The Merge had a positive impact both on adoption and market price. Since The Purge is expected to draw in new nodes and foster the development of new dApps, we can assume that Ethereum will benefit from the upgrade. It will grow its user base and become more decentralized, and it will also see a surge in price.","As blockchain technology advances, developments in the industry also continue to grow. The competition in the smart contracts field has led Ethereum to focus on improving its infrastructure. The Purge is just another step in this process. Taking into account the number of competitors that have gained prominence in the last couple of years, it is no surprise that the community is implementing changes to maintain its position as the leading dApps blockchain."],"create_date":"2024-05-07T07:15:16+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

This decentralised network was designed to remove the limitations of sharing digital content online. Tron, which uses the Tronix (TRX) as its native currency, enables artists to monetize their digital content.","The success of Tronix as a digital currency caused many online casinos to adopt it as a form of payment. This led to the creation of Tron gambling sites, which come packed with benefits that are peculiar to the Tron blockchain. The information in this article will give readers a much-needed perspective on all the benefits of visiting Tron gambling websites.","Tron gambling sites offer lots of peculiar benefits. You might be motivated to try Tron gambling sites based on some of the following advantages that they provide:","Visitors to Tron gambling websites will be astounded by the attention to detail put into these sites. Tron is a contemporary network, leading an example evident in its wagering websites. Playing your favorite games on a Tron gambling site will give them a new lease on life.","Traditional wagering platforms require customers to convert their local currency into an acceptable international one. So, transactions are conducted in popular fiat currencies like the United States dollar or the Euro.","Tron gambling sites, however, employ a unique end-to-end functionality that allows players to do all of these with Tron tokens. In other words, users will be able to deposit TRX into their accounts and use it for their wagers. Additionally, they have the option to withdraw their TRX winnings.","Prompt customer service is at the heart of every thriving 21st-century business. Popular commercial websites like Amazon and eBay have always answered every customer query promptly. This makes for a happy customer and entices them to a return visit.","Tron gaming websites are renowned for their quick responses to queries from users and their effective problem-solving skills. We can assume that these websites constantly invest in their users to gain repeat business.","Bettors can say goodbye to ridiculous bank fees when they start playing on Tron gaming platforms. There’ll be no need to pay huge amounts for deposits, withdrawals, or transfers of funds.","However, Tron is still a cryptocurrency, meaning that the users confirm transactions. Although it’s not directly mining, some transaction fees still need to be paid nonetheless. These fees are negligible compared to traditional transaction fees because they represent a tiny portion of the transaction’s value.","Transaction fees might be an issue if you’re using Tron gambling sites that convert TRX to fiat. These fiat conversion fees are outside the Tron blockchain’s domain, making them expensive.","Traditional online punters have always been touchy about privacy issues because they have none. Fiat currency leaves a paper trail whenever it moves, and the relevant authorities are always aware of your actions. So your bank knows whenever you transfer money from your account to a site.","Using a debit card or credit card on these gambing platforms could also get you in trouble. That’s because many financial institutions disapprove of their customers using these platforms. As such, it wouldn’t be a surprise if you found it hard to secure loans after visiting such websites.","Tron gambling sites, on the other hand, are sure to keep your activities discreet. They have no obligation to report to your bank whenever you deposit cash. They don’t even need to know much about you either, since they only require a little personal information from customers.","The processing times for traditional sites are extremely long because they use credit cards and banks. These financial institutions are required to report large transactions to governmental bodies, and this takes a lot of time. The checks and protocols at banks are also well-known time-wasters.","Conversely, Tron gambling sites provide speedy transactions for every bettor. As a crypto-staking platform, they report to no banks, and neither do they work under any regulatory body. So, all transactions are approved the second they are initiated.","Rapid transaction speed is an advantage shared by blockchain-based platforms and the blockchains themselves. Nevertheless, some cryptocurrencies are just faster than others, and Tron is one such digital coin. As a result, even when compared to other blockchain-based cryptocurrency staking websites, Tron gambling sites’ transaction speeds are quick.","All online gambling platforms provide some form of incentive to both old and new customers to keep them coming back. However, conventional betting incentives can never compare to those of Tron gambling sites.","Conventional sites offer bonuses after considering tax, transaction fees, and other levies that come from governmental bodies. Tron gambling sites operate beyond government control. This allows them to be more generous with their bonuses. Since they don’t have any taxes or levies to attend to, stakers can enjoy bigger bonuses for using the site.","These bonuses can be compared to free funds from these platforms, and Tron gambling sites give you more to work with. So, gamers visiting Tron gambling sites are guaranteed to have a good time due to their exciting bonuses.","Certain amounts that financial institutions consider sensitive, making it nearly impossible to deposit them on betting platforms. The banks wouldn’t allow you to deposit large amounts of money, nor would they allow you to withdraw them. For traditional stakers, these restrictions are just part of life and something they must put up with.","Tron gambling sites provide the much-needed freedom that conventional players wish for. There are hardly any limitations on the amounts that people can deposit or withdraw. In the rare case of such a limitation, the limits would only be placed for a justifiable reason.","Tron gambling sites’ advantages stand out compared to other blockchain-based platforms. It is now a particularly good time for gamblers to visit Tron gambling sites because Tron is still a relatively unknown cryptocurrency."],"create_date":"2022-08-09T11:29:46+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

To some people, these words could be new. Others think they mean the same. However, investing and trading are essential pillars of Bitcoin. They are also not the same.","Naturally, humans go for the most valuable things. From the moment a person learns to talk, walk, and interact, they haggle, exchange, and make deals that bring them the most value. Before humans invented physical money, people used a barter system to get what they needed or wanted by swapping what they had with what they didn’t have. Every item that humans used in a barter system had value.","What’s more, the value keeps changing depending on the object and how other people needed it, as well as its scarcity. Additionally, a person was better off with the items they got through barter trade than initially. And similar rules apply today when purchasing and selling items.","Investment and trading depend on humanity’s knack for getting what has value and considering its future value. In Bitcoin’s case, trading and investment have similar goals. People want to purchase and sell Bitcoin for a higher price than they use to acquire it. However, people use different strategies to trade Bitcoin.","Investment doesn’t provide a get-rich-quick option. An investment offers a way to accumulate wealth. When you invest in Bitcoin, you don’t focus on short-term profits. Instead, you purchase this virtual currency, hoping its value will increase over time. Once you opt to invest in Bitcoin, you don’t intend to spend or use your tokens soon.","An investor hopes to gradually grow a portfolio and make profits from holding onto this digital asset for some time. Crypto investors call this approach Hodling. Bitcoin investing is somehow unusual because an investor doesn’t pay greater attention to current affairs or news about the crypto market every day. Instead, they hold onto their Bitcoin through multiple price cycles. Thus, a Bitcoin investor won’t sell their digital asset when the price drops.","Most investors think that most assets’ prices increase over time. A Bitcoin investor can hold onto their digital currency for several reasons. For instance, an investment gets an early mover the biggest reward. Therefore, purchasing an asset before other people enables an investor to pay a lower price and make more profits upon selling it later. Another reason is that Bitcoin’s value will eventually increase as mainstream finance adopts it and prominent companies accept it as a payment method.","Bitcoin trading provides a way to accumulate wealth fast, provided you use an effective strategy. Trading is often a high-octane and fast-paced method of making money. A person trades Bitcoin on a medium or short-term basis. A Bitcoin trader follows events, news, and market activity throughout the day to monitor indications that hint at a potential change in Bitcoin price. The Bitcoin market is volatile. Therefore, a trader faces more risk than an investor.","When trading Bitcoin, you aim to purchase the virtual currency at a low price and then sell it when it increases its value. In most cases, this trading involves medium-sized trades. However, people can also engage in more significant transactions. Nevertheless, this trading comes with volatility and a dynamic force while settling into the worldwide market. But the volatility that surrounds Bitcoin trading provides a possibility for benefiting from high yields.","Both Bitcoin trading and Bitcoin investing was initially exclusive to the financial elites. However, things have changed, and almost anybody can trade or invest in Bitcoin. What a person needs to trade Bitcoin is a crypto exchange like Oil Profit, read our review about oil profit and a digital wallet. That way, a person can buy and sell or invest in Bitcoin using their smartphone anytime, anywhere."],"create_date":"2023-10-04T09:37:33+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

The introduction of online poker platforms marked a significant milestone, creating a global poker community and reshaping the way poker was played.","Platforms such as GGPoker exemplify the integration of complex software solutions that cater to user preferences and ensure secure and fair play. The evolution from simple web-based casinos to sophisticated platforms capable of handling millions of transactions daily illustrates the sector’s significant growth and the increasing trust and interest from the general public.","Crypto gambling leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to offer a gambling experience that is both transparent and secure. Unlike traditional online casinos that rely on external and often opaque payment processors, crypto casinos use blockchain to directly handle deposits, bets, and withdrawals. This system inherently records all transactions on a distributed ledger, offering an unprecedented level of transaction transparency and auditability. Furthermore, the use of smart contracts automates the betting and payout processes, minimizing human intervention and the associated risk of manipulation.","Crypto casinos often operate with a significantly lower overhead due to fewer regulatory and compliance costs, allowing for more competitive odds and lower house edges. This technological framework not only enhances the security and efficiency of online betting but also opens new avenues for user engagement and retention by promoting fairness and trust.","Crypto gambling stands at a pivotal juncture between technological innovation and widespread acceptance. Platforms like GGPoker exemplify the potential of this industry to not only provide enhanced gaming experiences but also to reshape how online betting is perceived and regulated. As challenges such as regulatory uncertainties and market volatility are addressed, the future of crypto gambling looks promising, with the potential to offer more secure, private, and accessible betting options than ever before.",""],"create_date":"2024-05-14T12:21:25+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

A distributed ledger is used to keep and maintain a database of transactions. Its usage in digital currencies is only the beginning, and experts believe that this technology can revolutionise investments. Blockchains are a lot similar to digital spreadsheets in which you can customise them however you want. Even today,the technology is being adopted by large grocery stores like Walmart to make their supply chain management more efficient. They use blockchains to keep track of their food products to help prevent any food contamination or spoilage from happening.","But how exactly can they change how we make investments? There are a lot of different ways that they can do so.","For starters, if blockchain technology were to be applied, then the processing time for post- trade settlements will be nearly instantaneous. The process for post trade settlements averages at about three days due to the numerous intermediaries involved for each transaction. If the transaction was made on a distributed ledger, then the trade can be programmed to be fully automated and instantaneous, taking settlement time from 3 days to just minutes or even seconds. Check out Cryptogeek for more in-depth reviews about blockchain companies.","Trading costs will also be affected. If processes were automated and intermediaries were removed from the picture, trading costs would fall. Consequently, investors would also benefit from lower trading costs. At the moment, it’s believed that the trading market shells out up to $150 billion per year for banking expenses and post-trade security services. These costs can be lowered if blockchain technologies were to be used in the trading market.","Adopting blockchains would also mean that trading could be done 24/7, all days of the week. Using distributed ledgers would enable exchanges all over the world to be open 24 hours every day of the week. Trading will no longer be affected by factors like time zones and geographic boundaries. This could also potentially change how troubleshooting and crises are handled since there will always be an active part of the network at any given time.","What else? Well, distributed ledgers would allow all of its users to view the full record of all transactions. This would give more transparency and grow trust in the trading market. Each trade that would happen will just be added to a block in the chain and anyone will see the records. Not only that but blockchains could also be programmed to monitor and regulate transactions to automatically detect and block any suspicious or illegal activity in the network. This not only increases transparency but increases trust as well.","Communications are also expected to be improved with the adoption of blockchains. Once transparency and trust have grown, this effect can trickle down onto investors and investment managers. Since information on trades and account transactions can be accessed and relayed more easily, investment account managers can monitor their clients’ portfolios in real time. The use of blockchain can also help make the onboarding process easier by granting access to profile information using secure and encrypted keys. Like this, institutions can also have an easier (and faster) time transferring their assets to one another.","Here’s a secure and easy to use trading platform that can help you get set up with the right tools for trading crypto.","And lastly, blockchains can help investors see more liquidity. Having blockchains in place would save investors from the arduous administrative tasks that come with transferring share ownership for complex assets like real estate. If all of the information on transactions were recorded on the blockchain, that would remove the need for all the headache inducing paperwork and administrative tasks involved. This reduces the lock-in period that comes with a lot of private investments, giving investors the chance to have control over how long they want to participate in those aspects of their portfolios."],"create_date":"2023-10-04T09:59:43+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Only the most advanced took the risk of gambling with the still unpopular, but gaining momentum, digital currency. It is worth noting that operators were also taking a big risk by opening such establishments. No one could understand how the cryptocurrency worked, especially with its ever-evolving exchange rate. The future of both the underlying currency and the operator itself also seemed elusive. However, it turned out that all these fears were unfounded. Europe has long appreciated the cryptocurrency’s functionality, and other markets are starting to pick up on it at a rapid pace. In Asian countries, for example, there is a growing trend for players and land-based casinos to use cryptocurrency.","Over the years, cryptocurrency has shown its effectiveness in online casinos, so the number of participants has grown by thousands of times. If you’re not one of them yet, there are at least six reasons why you should become familiar with crypto casinos and their games:","More generous bonuses. Generous bonuses are famous for any crypto casino. Due to the lack of monetary service fees from financial institutions (participation in blockchain is free), this allows operators to reward players to a greater extent than would be possible in standard establishments.","All of this has contributed to what is now known – almost every operator in the gambling club network has establishments in which payments can be made in cryptocurrency. In addition, people from all over the world can play with this unique currency.","Cryptocurrency has made its way into the lives and fortunes of players, but the licensing regulators do not always agree. Even though there is such a thing as no verification casino in USA, there is still no consensus among authorities on digital currencies, including within online casinos. Some states approve of their use, others strongly oppose their use in online casinos. The reason is the existence of legal acts prohibiting the use of risky assets. Cryptocurrency fully fits this concept.","Recently, there has been some movement in this area. some states have started to waive this rule in order to make up for the budget. In any case, if the rules of the operator themselves allow you to register with a cryptocurrency casino, you will be allowed access anyway. The main thing is to buy cryptocurrency, register with a reliable casino and play.","UKGC, while not the first regulator to notice the convenience of cryptocurrencies in online casinos, is already appreciating its possibilities. The GC, which is responsible for issuing licenses to operators, is very strict about enforcing the rule of law and players’ rights. The latest legislative innovations will start controlling cryptocurrency players more strongly than before, requiring them to undergo verification. On the one hand, the validity of the claim that cryptocurrency is anonymous is lost. On the other hand, it is not to control casino visitors, but to combat fraud and money laundering via blockchain.","When choosing a crypto casino with a UKGC license, the player chooses security. One of the main requirements for operators is to provide absolute security for both the website itself and the blockchain platforms. This increases the reliability of transactions many times over. Any UK online casino is available on all existing devices with internet access. This makes gambling even more popular because it is now closer than ever.","The UKGC regulates all types of gambling in online casinos – video slots, table games, card games, lotteries, sports betting, bingo, keno. Whatever games are present on the operator’s website, the player should stick to the rules of responsible gaming, and the casino itself should take maximum action on its part to ensure that only users with a serious approach to gambling can play. Even if you play anonymously with cryptocurrency, you should understand how important it is to have control over yourself and your money.","The gambling industry in Canada is friendly to all existing casinos – land-based, online and even crypto casinos. This is not surprising, as the payment of taxes by the operators does not make the Canadian treasury feel deficient. That said, it should be understood that each province has its own general laws that apply to crypto casinos as well. The player’s task is to understand them on their own and not to violate the rules concerning their interests and obligations. Whichever crypto casino you choose for that country, the most important thing is to find a reliable establishment with a license. This will fully protect you from unfair actions from the casino administration.","Gambling has been legal in Australia in most states since 2001. Only one state is still on the defensive about legalising gambling. However, according to a survey, this state has the support of ⅔ of the country’s population. They are in favor of a complete ban on gambling, both land-based and online. Speaking out against advertising they are, however, not against playing in online casinos. This is also honestly stated by more than half of the adult respondents.","Not every online club accepts crypto payments. There can be many nuances to the reasons, but the most real ones seem to be personal distrust of digital currencies by operators and the policy of using traditional currencies. Regardless, there is absolutely no shortage of gaming sites to choose from. More and more casino owners are paying attention to this rapidly growing market, while adjusting to the demands of modern players."],"create_date":"2022-09-22T08:39:22+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

There are lots of different brokers to choose from, but some are clearly better than others. In this article you get some tips on what to consider when looking for a crypto broker.","It is no secret that investing in cryptocurrency has become so popular that it has become a frenzy. Everybody is talking about cryptocurrencies at the moment. Even though it is a highly volatile type of investment, it also brings some new opportunities with it. The decentralization of blockchain and cryptocurrency is paving new ways for many things.","Many cryptocurrencies can be used for more than just as an investment case. Some can be used to pay for physical products and services. In the world of gaming and NFTs, cryptocurrencies are playing an increasingly bigger role. Also, in online gambling, more and more people chose to play at bitcoin casinos. This can of course be somewhat of a double-gamble, but it also holds some opportunities in terms of instant transactions and anonymity when gambling. But if you are just getting started with cryptocurrency and are looking for a broker, there are a few things to consider.","The most important thing of all is that you make sure to choose an authentic and trustworthy broker. There are unfortunately a lot of scams in the world of crypto, so this is something to be on the lookout for. Make sure to read reviews and look out for all the red flags before signing up and transferring any money. Also, cryptocurrency can be a great addition to a portfolio, if you know what you are dealing with. But as a beginner, it is important to think twice about your investment. Start by reading about both pros and cons before investing.","The next thing to consider when choosing a broker is methods of purchasing. These vary from site to site as some use credit cards, other PayPal, bank transfers or even only cryptocurrency. When you are a beginner, it is important to remember to choose a broker that accepts fiat currency. You should also check how quickly their transactions run, some are able to process transactions almost instantly, whereas others have a transaction process of days or even weeks.","There are many different types of cryptocurrencies. Make sure to check which tokens that the site you choose supports. If you want to invest in stable coins for example, make sure that the broker supports these. Most brokers support the big cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.","Another important thing to consider when choosing the best crypto broker is the user experience. It is important that the platform has an intuitive interface and high-quality user experience aids. Additionally, it is of importans that you can receive assistance from your broker if any uncertainties should occur."],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

What hardware do I need?","title":"What is Ethereum Mining and How to Start Mining ETH | CryptoRunner","content":["8 June, 2022 by Guest Post","The first thing to know about Ethereum mining is that, unlike Bitcoin, you do not need to spend thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars on a dedicated mining computer that can do nothing else and is quickly outdated. A good gaming rig will do it.","The second thing to know about mining Ethereum is that it’s about to change.","An upgrade called Ethereum 2.0 is in the works, and will go live in phases over the next couple of years. The Ethereum blockchain will switch from a Bitcoin-style Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to a more eco-friendly alternative known as Proof-of-Stake.","The good news is that — for now it remains possible to mine ETH as a “little guy.” But for now… how does Ethereum mining work?","Your first question might be: what is Ethereum mining for? Well, the purpose is twofold.","The key purpose of mining is to add new transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. Every time ETH is sent to a new address, that transaction is sent to a holding area so it can be included in an upcoming block. This is then added to the end of Ethereum’s immutable, and unchangeable, blockchain.","Ethereum miners vie for the right to create that block, which essentially means gathering a set number of transactions, putting them in order, and then uploading that information.","In exchange, the miner selected to write a new block — which happens about every 13 seconds — earns several rewards.","The most important of these rewards is creating a number of new ETH as a reward for winning the race to “mine” the next block. But on 1 December 2021, a “difficulty bomb” will eliminate this over a few months, paving the way for Ethereum 2.0.","Miners also earn transaction fees. This is the “gas” paid by users for each transaction. Originally, the biggest gas fee offered was put on the blockchain first. Ethereum price were volatile and often skyhigh — and when Ethereum became congested as DeFi and NFTs grew in popularity, too little gas could mean big delays.","Now, there is a set fee that fluctuates based on how congested the blockchain is. However, part of that fee — which used to go entirely to the miner — is now used to burn existing ETH. As an alternative, those making payments can “tip” miners to ensure their transactions are bumped up the list and added to the blockchain first.","The changes coming with the switch to Ethereum 2.0 go far beyond how miners — who will be renamed “stakers” — earn rewards.","Proof-of-Work is a flat-out race, a sprint to see who can be the first to solve a mathematical problem. Brute power wins.","On the other hand, Proof-of-Stake can be thought of as putting up a bond for good behaviour. To run a full node, you’ll need to lock 32 ETH or join a mining pool.","Instead of miners, stakers are generally called validators — they are confirming the transactions before putting them into a new block. Under PoS, the node selected to create the new block is randomly selected based on the size of their stake.","So… how does Ethereum mining work? First off, you’ll need a mining rig. These can be specialised ASIC machines that do nothing else and can be expensive.","Unlike Bitcoin, you can mine Ethereum with a good gaming rig — they cost $1,000 to $4,000 as of late 2021 — and remember the graphics card is key. Also, look at the cost of power in your area.","Assuming you’re not going to buy a specialised Ethereum ASIC miner, you’ve got to join a mining pool.","How to start mining Ethereum on your PC is fairly straightforward. First off, know that mining software is specific to your computer, operating system, graphics card — Nvidia, AMD, etc. — and supported by your pool. Don’t make looking for software an afterthought to buying a new PC.","Second, look at the hashrate, but also know that what software makers claim isn’t always what pools report.","Third, know that this software can be complex — many run on Linux.","The biggest is to dramatically increase what’s called scalability — or how many transactions per second the Ethereum blockchain can handle. Currently, it can support about 30 TPS. Ethereum 2.0 promises up to 100,000 TPS. This is key as Ethereum cannot handle the current demands of DeFi and NFTs, which are set to grow exponentially in coming years.","One facet of PoS is that the stake you put up will be slashed — meaning you’ll be fined — for malicious actions, but also for problems like downtime. So reliable power and a battery backup will become far more important.","Next is that Ethereum will stop sucking down so much electricity that it is an actual global warming threat. As of October 2021, it uses as much as the whole of New Zealand. Proof-of-Stake’s energy consumption is negligible.","All in all, how to mine Ethereum is changing. It’ll be better for Ethereum users. But for miners — soon to be validators — the rewards look likely to fall."],"create_date":"2022-06-08T14:26:02+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

To date, there are over 10,000 different cryptocurrencies available to explore. This article picks out a few that are likely to do well in the future because of their superior technology than other forms of crypto. They are all relatively new currencies. These are some of the newest coins and tokens in the online market in 2024 to explore:","An anonymous creator made the Shiba Inu Coin in 2020. They named this coin after a breed of dog that originated in the Japanese Chubu region. Shiba Inu is a direct competitor of Dogecoin, built on the Bitcoin blockchain. As a result, it is costly to use. Shiba Inu is based on an existing blockchain that is cheaper to run. Therefore, it is becoming a preferred buying option. It is one of the decentralized cryptocurrencies in the Ethereum network. Shiba Inu has a market capitalization of $19.6 billion. The highest price it has reached is $0.00007957.","","Anatoly Yakovenko created Solana in 2017. He created this crypto on an open-sourced public blockchain part of the Ethereum blockchain. Solana is a blockchain platform for decentralized applications. Importantly, this type of application can work independently. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are an excellent example of this. Furthermore, Solana serves 65,000 transactions per second and is one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization. Solana is the world’s fastest blockchain. It has a market capitalization of 28 billion. Moreover, they can provide faster and cheaper transactions than their competitors. As a result, they prove to be a worthy adversary to Ethereum.","The Golem Factory (a group of investors) launched this crypto in 2016. An Ethereum token allows users to use the Golem protocol to pay for and receive resources. The protocol’s goal is to allow network participants to lend their computer’s extra processing capacity to others. Golem has one billion coins in circulation that participants can exchange on platforms like Binance and KuCoin. Like Solana, it is also part of the Ethereum blockchain. Without a doubt, Golem will increase in value over time. They have envisioned Golem to be a supercomputer that can connect buyers and sellers for a variety of services, including CGI rendering, artificial intelligence, and bitcoin mining. They have a market capitalization of $434, 487, 299. USD.","Evan Duffield launched dash in 2014. This is a system of crypto where you can send money quickly and easily to anyone in the world. Dash created a new digital currency that works similarly to Bitcoin because they built it on the Bitcoin codebase. In addition to this, their transactions take about two and a half minutes on average, which is four times faster than Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time. It has over 10.18 million coins in circulation and has a market cap of $849,097,225. USD. There are many ways to earn money with dash and other cryptocurrencies.","","UNIDO’s token $UDO: it’s the utility token of the UNIDO ecosystem.

This decentralised network was designed to remove the limitations of sharing digital content online. Tron, which uses the Tronix (TRX) as its native currency, enables artists to monetize their digital content.","The success of Tronix as a digital currency caused many online casinos to adopt it as a form of payment. This led to the creation of Tron gambling sites, which come packed with benefits that are peculiar to the Tron blockchain. The information in this article will give readers a much-needed perspective on all the benefits of visiting Tron gambling websites.","Tron gambling sites offer lots of peculiar benefits. You might be motivated to try Tron gambling sites based on some of the following advantages that they provide:","Visitors to Tron gambling websites will be astounded by the attention to detail put into these sites. Tron is a contemporary network, leading an example evident in its wagering websites. Playing your favorite games on a Tron gambling site will give them a new lease on life.","Traditional wagering platforms require customers to convert their local currency into an acceptable international one. So, transactions are conducted in popular fiat currencies like the United States dollar or the Euro.","Tron gambling sites, however, employ a unique end-to-end functionality that allows players to do all of these with Tron tokens. In other words, users will be able to deposit TRX into their accounts and use it for their wagers. Additionally, they have the option to withdraw their TRX winnings.","Prompt customer service is at the heart of every thriving 21st-century business. Popular commercial websites like Amazon and eBay have always answered every customer query promptly. This makes for a happy customer and entices them to a return visit.","Tron gaming websites are renowned for their quick responses to queries from users and their effective problem-solving skills. We can assume that these websites constantly invest in their users to gain repeat business.","Bettors can say goodbye to ridiculous bank fees when they start playing on Tron gaming platforms. There’ll be no need to pay huge amounts for deposits, withdrawals, or transfers of funds.","However, Tron is still a cryptocurrency, meaning that the users confirm transactions. Although it’s not directly mining, some transaction fees still need to be paid nonetheless. These fees are negligible compared to traditional transaction fees because they represent a tiny portion of the transaction’s value.","Transaction fees might be an issue if you’re using Tron gambling sites that convert TRX to fiat. These fiat conversion fees are outside the Tron blockchain’s domain, making them expensive.","Traditional online punters have always been touchy about privacy issues because they have none. Fiat currency leaves a paper trail whenever it moves, and the relevant authorities are always aware of your actions. So your bank knows whenever you transfer money from your account to a site.","Using a debit card or credit card on these gambing platforms could also get you in trouble. That’s because many financial institutions disapprove of their customers using these platforms. As such, it wouldn’t be a surprise if you found it hard to secure loans after visiting such websites.","Tron gambling sites, on the other hand, are sure to keep your activities discreet. They have no obligation to report to your bank whenever you deposit cash. They don’t even need to know much about you either, since they only require a little personal information from customers.","The processing times for traditional sites are extremely long because they use credit cards and banks. These financial institutions are required to report large transactions to governmental bodies, and this takes a lot of time. The checks and protocols at banks are also well-known time-wasters.","Conversely, Tron gambling sites provide speedy transactions for every bettor. As a crypto-staking platform, they report to no banks, and neither do they work under any regulatory body. So, all transactions are approved the second they are initiated.","Rapid transaction speed is an advantage shared by blockchain-based platforms and the blockchains themselves. Nevertheless, some cryptocurrencies are just faster than others, and Tron is one such digital coin. As a result, even when compared to other blockchain-based cryptocurrency staking websites, Tron gambling sites’ transaction speeds are quick.","All online gambling platforms provide some form of incentive to both old and new customers to keep them coming back. However, conventional betting incentives can never compare to those of Tron gambling sites.","Conventional sites offer bonuses after considering tax, transaction fees, and other levies that come from governmental bodies. Tron gambling sites operate beyond government control. This allows them to be more generous with their bonuses. Since they don’t have any taxes or levies to attend to, stakers can enjoy bigger bonuses for using the site.","These bonuses can be compared to free funds from these platforms, and Tron gambling sites give you more to work with. So, gamers visiting Tron gambling sites are guaranteed to have a good time due to their exciting bonuses.","Certain amounts that financial institutions consider sensitive, making it nearly impossible to deposit them on betting platforms. The banks wouldn’t allow you to deposit large amounts of money, nor would they allow you to withdraw them. For traditional stakers, these restrictions are just part of life and something they must put up with.","Tron gambling sites provide the much-needed freedom that conventional players wish for. There are hardly any limitations on the amounts that people can deposit or withdraw. In the rare case of such a limitation, the limits would only be placed for a justifiable reason.","Tron gambling sites’ advantages stand out compared to other blockchain-based platforms. It is now a particularly good time for gamblers to visit Tron gambling sites because Tron is still a relatively unknown cryptocurrency."],"create_date":"2022-08-09T11:29:46+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Everyone seems to understand the importance and follow the trend of investing in crypto. There are more than 21,000 cryptocurrencies in existence and over 130,000,000 tokens.","The leading technologies used to develop and grow new altcoins are based on the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains. Bitcoin has a limited number of tokens that the blockchain accepts. The limit is 21 million, and there are 19 million Bitcoin tokens in circulation.","Ethereum, however, offers an infinite supply. Currently, there are over 120 million tokens, and Polygon is one of them.","Polygon is developed on Ethereum’s blockchain, and its coin is MATIC. Like other newly made altcoins, it is a decentralized Ethereum scaling platform. This means that it also allows developers to build scalable, user-friendly dApps with minimal transaction fees and better security.","Simply said, this crypto is used as a cryptocurrency payment method for paying the network’s transaction fees.","Some of Polygon’s scaling protocols are:","You can invest in Polygon on every trading platform.","Its market capitalization is $624,690,227 USD at this moment and it has a $279,845,363 USD 24h volume. The token is limited, and the total supply of the MATIC token is 10,000,000,000, and over 8,040,000,000 MATIC tokens are already in circulation.","Polygon’s tokens are also divided into several functional categories on the market: 16% are team tokens, 12% are network tokens, 24% are in the ecosystem, and 4% are advisors. The remaining tokens are for the foundation.","Every crypto enthusiast would like to know if Polygon is worth investing in. Some people and businesses consider it an excellent investment, and others are not convinced about that.","Many companies and high-profile businesses launched projects on Polygon. Meta, Adobe, fashion companies such as Dolce & Gabanna and Prada, and online casinos commenced future projects with this altcoin.","It might seem bizarre at first that a cryptocurrency caught the eye of the gambling industry. MATIC is an improved token with a low market cost. This reason attracted many online gambling establishments, such as The Draft Kings, to invest and accept it as a valid payment method.","Another reason is the functionality. Polygon is forked from Ethereum, and people have known how it works for quite some time now. Gamblers that wager with crypto are used to Ethereum and can change the coin easily. Naturally, casinos want to find suitable solutions to ensure their guests’ safety and fast payment methods.","Polygon has real potential to become one of the favourite coins in gambling and other industries. It is safer, faster to mine, and cheaper than Ethereum, but it works the same way, so people are drawn to it. It has promising potential and many projects and dApps to develop in the near future.","At the same time, Polygon, like every other cryptocurrency, is volatile. The price of MATIC will not surpass $1, as some experts say, but the volatility still happens.","Investors and the coin’s developers have numerous plans for the future, but nothing is granted. The token can lose its value, or even the Ethereum blockchain network can decline and drop its popularity rates. This affects every coin on that blockchain, including MATIC.","You can invest in Polygon and be updated daily about the new projects, the price, and how many tokens are in circulation. If you decide on buying a supply of MATIC, don’t forget the golden rule of crypto investments: Don’t put in more than you can afford to lose."],"create_date":"2022-09-14T07:28:53+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

That is when sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson coined it in his novel Snow Crash. It took two decades before something resembling a 3D virtual shared space (a metaverse) appeared, and in the past two years, multiple such platforms have sprung into existence. Partially owned by the Digital Currency Group, Decentraland is likely, the most popular of these, boasting a user base of several hundred thousand members.","In March 2021, gaming trailblazer, the legendary Atari, announced that they had leased an estate in Decentraland’s Vegas City district to open a crypto casino. A virtual gambling establishment, accepting the Decentral Games token, plus the Atari and the platform’s native one, MANA. The surprising move brought Atari’s name back into the limelight as a brand that is once again prone to making brave choices that can have wide-reaching effects across multiple industries.","Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney gave birth to Atari in 1972. At the tail end of that year, this company introduced its first-ever product, the world-renowned Pong, a more advanced version of Tennis for Two. By 1980, both of Atari’s creators would leave the video game developer, Dabney in 1973, and Bushnell in 1979, three years following Warner Communications purchasing the brand.","As many gaming enthusiasts/historians know, 1983 was a horrible year for video games. During this time, this market dramatically crashed, causing many of its entities to reorient. Atari did so by shifting its focus to the home computer market, but it never achieved the heights it reached before this period.","Undoubtedly, the peak of the Atari brand was when they were riding high on the success of their Video Computer System, the Atari 2600. The console that popularized swappable ROM cartridges and ushered in microprocessor-based hardware in consumer-level electronics. Over five hundred game cartridges got sold for the Atari 2600, including revolutionary games such as Pac-Man and Space Invaders.","Now, Atari is again trying to rebrand itself as a major metaverse player. It is constructing metaverse crypto casinos that provide a new kind of gambling fun.","The terms Bitcoin casino and cryptocurrency casino get used interchangeably. That happens despite the fact they indicate different types of platforms. The first signifies a gambling site that accepts the world’s most famous digital coin for wagers, while the latter hints that multiple types of coin-based transfers may be possible at an interactive gaming hub. So, the acceptance of cryptographic currency is the defining aspect of any top crypto casino. On top of this, these platforms also differ from fiat ones by incorporating bonuses unique to only them and by trying to foster a community presence. They do the latter by implementing group chats, adding message boards, and running highly-active Telegram groups, where they give away various promos. Social media contests and perk-rich loyalty schemes are also one of their main allures.","Now, metaverse crypto casinos offer an interaction element previously unseen at traditional gambling sites and ones allowing coin-based transactions. Hence, many consider them the future of crypto gambling sites, as they bring games of chance fans one step closer to the real thing.","An NFT, by definition, is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger, a blockchain. It is a virtual asset that can get traded or sold. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin represent fungible assets, meaning many identical items, while non-fungible ones, NFTs, are unique. To simplify, the best way to think of NFTs is like one-of-a-kind skins for a video game like Fortnite. For example, Atari used Enjin’s technology to release Atari-inspired digital fashion NFTs that can get worn across multiple metaverse platforms.","While NFTs add a spice of uniqueness and novelty to every virtual shared space, these digital worlds would not exist without fungible tokens. They utilize blockchain technology to create self-sustaining economies that bring them closer to fully mimicking as many user interactions as those in the physical sphere. Hence, all crypto-powered metaverses have their form of money, a fungible token based on the ERC-20 standard. Users utilize these currencies to pay for goods and services in their chosen virtual setting.","The Atari token also uses Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard. It hopes to become the interactive gaming sector’s go-to money form for metaverse gambling. It can get bought and sold on Atari’s decentralized exchange or at Atari Dex. It offers smart contract security, easy integration, and much more. So, it should not catch anyone by surprise to see it get listed at many more metaverse crypto casinos soon.","Found in Decentraland’s gambling district named Vegas City, the Atari casino launched with a mega party attended by over two thousand users, enhanced by a live performance from DJ Dillon Francis. Though it promised to feature Atari-inspired gaming picks, at the time of its release, this metaverse mainly housed blackjack and roulette tables, similar to those at Bitcoin gambling sites, except these, get run by robot-like croupiers. Atari is just now looking to expand their venue’s gaming offer by introducing skill-based gambling on casino-like products that feature motifs from the company’s games of yonder.","Online mediums have been propagating since the start of 2021 that the world is amidst a virtual real estate explosion. Many business analysts now claim that metaverses are the next iteration of social media. And since these 3D platforms feature vast maps that users can traverse for days, each section of this virtual land can get owned, either by people purchasing it during a platform’s initial coin offering or by snagging parcels on primary and secondary markets. CNBC reported that prices for plots in metaverses have jumped by 500% in under a year. Grayscale, a crypto asset manager, recently estimated that this sphere could soon grow into a trillion-dollar business. Tokens.com, a corporate entity operated by Andrew Kiguel, spent $2.4 million worth of cryptocurrency on an estate in Decentraland in November 2021.","It is vital to note that Atari leased its land in Decentraland for two years. It did not buy it. Nevertheless, depending on the performance of its cryptocurrency casino in Decentraland, it may consider purchasing some relatively soon. Grand View Research believes that this market boasted a value of $3.7 billion in 2021 and that it should grow at an annual rate of 5.2% until 2030.","It cannot get argued that crypto and Bitcoin casinos are surging. Coin-based gaming platforms like Stake are collaborating with artists like Drake, and exchanges like Crypto.com have made it onto the illustrious list of sponsors of the Qatar World Cup. Therefore, they are not the future but the present.","Still, many worry about the future of this sphere on account of looming crypto regulations everywhere. Some countries have even taken an active stance against cryptos, trying to phase them out. So, exploring metaverses with significant investments is a risky endeavor, as there are no guarantees that this trend will morph into a reality that will stick around for years/decades to come.","Nonetheless, Atari entered this market early, and they got loads of publicity for making this bold move. They also now have a chance to advertise their existing catalog of games, and their brand to new demographics through a new medium, which can help their future crypto and NFT projects flourish. Consequently, while this is still a gamble, everything is in life. It seems like everyone is hopping aboard the crypto/metaverse train, so it stands to reason that Atari would do the same. It benefits them that they did so early, but only time will tell whether the money and effort spent will pay out or not."],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

The decentralization of blockchain and cryptocurrency is paving new ways for many things.","Many cryptocurrencies can be used for more than just as an investment case.

By 1980, both of Atari’s creators would leave the video game developer, Dabney in 1973, and Bushnell in 1979, three years following Warner Communications purchasing the brand.","As many gaming enthusiasts/historians know, 1983 was a horrible year for video games. During this time, this market dramatically crashed, causing many of its entities to reorient. Atari did so by shifting its focus to the home computer market, but it never achieved the heights it reached before this period.","Undoubtedly, the peak of the Atari brand was when they were riding high on the success of their Video Computer System, the Atari 2600. The console that popularized swappable ROM cartridges and ushered in microprocessor-based hardware in consumer-level electronics. Over five hundred game cartridges got sold for the Atari 2600, including revolutionary games such as Pac-Man and Space Invaders.","Now, Atari is again trying to rebrand itself as a major metaverse player. It is constructing metaverse crypto casinos that provide a new kind of gambling fun.","The terms Bitcoin casino and cryptocurrency casino get used interchangeably. That happens despite the fact they indicate different types of platforms. The first signifies a gambling site that accepts the world’s most famous digital coin for wagers, while the latter hints that multiple types of coin-based transfers may be possible at an interactive gaming hub. So, the acceptance of cryptographic currency is the defining aspect of any top crypto casino. On top of this, these platforms also differ from fiat ones by incorporating bonuses unique to only them and by trying to foster a community presence. They do the latter by implementing group chats, adding message boards, and running highly-active Telegram groups, where they give away various promos. Social media contests and perk-rich loyalty schemes are also one of their main allures.","Now, metaverse crypto casinos offer an interaction element previously unseen at traditional gambling sites and ones allowing coin-based transactions. Hence, many consider them the future of crypto gambling sites, as they bring games of chance fans one step closer to the real thing.","An NFT, by definition, is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger, a blockchain. It is a virtual asset that can get traded or sold. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin represent fungible assets, meaning many identical items, while non-fungible ones, NFTs, are unique. To simplify, the best way to think of NFTs is like one-of-a-kind skins for a video game like Fortnite. For example, Atari used Enjin’s technology to release Atari-inspired digital fashion NFTs that can get worn across multiple metaverse platforms.","While NFTs add a spice of uniqueness and novelty to every virtual shared space, these digital worlds would not exist without fungible tokens. They utilize blockchain technology to create self-sustaining economies that bring them closer to fully mimicking as many user interactions as those in the physical sphere. Hence, all crypto-powered metaverses have their form of money, a fungible token based on the ERC-20 standard. Users utilize these currencies to pay for goods and services in their chosen virtual setting.","The Atari token also uses Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard. It hopes to become the interactive gaming sector’s go-to money form for metaverse gambling. It can get bought and sold on Atari’s decentralized exchange or at Atari Dex. It offers smart contract security, easy integration, and much more. So, it should not catch anyone by surprise to see it get listed at many more metaverse crypto casinos soon.","Found in Decentraland’s gambling district named Vegas City, the Atari casino launched with a mega party attended by over two thousand users, enhanced by a live performance from DJ Dillon Francis. Though it promised to feature Atari-inspired gaming picks, at the time of its release, this metaverse mainly housed blackjack and roulette tables, similar to those at Bitcoin gambling sites, except these, get run by robot-like croupiers. Atari is just now looking to expand their venue’s gaming offer by introducing skill-based gambling on casino-like products that feature motifs from the company’s games of yonder.","Online mediums have been propagating since the start of 2021 that the world is amidst a virtual real estate explosion. Many business analysts now claim that metaverses are the next iteration of social media. And since these 3D platforms feature vast maps that users can traverse for days, each section of this virtual land can get owned, either by people purchasing it during a platform’s initial coin offering or by snagging parcels on primary and secondary markets. CNBC reported that prices for plots in metaverses have jumped by 500% in under a year. Grayscale, a crypto asset manager, recently estimated that this sphere could soon grow into a trillion-dollar business. Tokens.com, a corporate entity operated by Andrew Kiguel, spent $2.4 million worth of cryptocurrency on an estate in Decentraland in November 2021.","It is vital to note that Atari leased its land in Decentraland for two years. It did not buy it. Nevertheless, depending on the performance of its cryptocurrency casino in Decentraland, it may consider purchasing some relatively soon. Grand View Research believes that this market boasted a value of $3.7 billion in 2021 and that it should grow at an annual rate of 5.2% until 2030.","It cannot get argued that crypto and Bitcoin casinos are surging. Coin-based gaming platforms like Stake are collaborating with artists like Drake, and exchanges like Crypto.com have made it onto the illustrious list of sponsors of the Qatar World Cup. Therefore, they are not the future but the present.","Still, many worry about the future of this sphere on account of looming crypto regulations everywhere. Some countries have even taken an active stance against cryptos, trying to phase them out. So, exploring metaverses with significant investments is a risky endeavor, as there are no guarantees that this trend will morph into a reality that will stick around for years/decades to come.","Nonetheless, Atari entered this market early, and they got loads of publicity for making this bold move. They also now have a chance to advertise their existing catalog of games, and their brand to new demographics through a new medium, which can help their future crypto and NFT projects flourish. Consequently, while this is still a gamble, everything is in life. It seems like everyone is hopping aboard the crypto/metaverse train, so it stands to reason that Atari would do the same. It benefits them that they did so early, but only time will tell whether the money and effort spent will pay out or not."],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

A wide range of individuals and firms showed a strong, sharp rise in demand for these assets in recent times. Although the market valuation of crypto assets increased by 3.5 times to $2.6 trillion in 2021, they still make up a very modest part of the total assets of the international economic market. They are expanding quickly; there are currently few direct links between crypto-assets and the fundamental currency sector and significant financial organisations. However, despite starting from a low basis, professional participation in the cryptocurrency industry has increased over the past year, both as buyers and service providers. Worldwide financial sustainability may be affected if the size and connectivity of crypto-assets to these organisations stay on their current trend of growth.","The valuation of assets like cryptocurrencies may potentially be a concern for investors. There are numerous methods for estimating probable future costs for the commodity as bitcoin will not provide free cash flow. Predicted market values by 2026 range from $100,000 to more than $500,000 utilising four effective techniques of pricing: the gold pricing technique, stock-to-flow approach, organisational participation strategy, and high-net-worth participation technique. The stock-to-flow concept failed completely to precisely measure the value of bitcoin.","Given that this asset class is still in its infancy, investors should take a variety of technical indicators into account when determining its great possibilities.","Most crypto users are familiar with the history of Bitcoin’s pricing. This currency has developed into one of the largest assets in the globe from just being absolutely almost insignificant. Bitcoin’s market cap peaked even greater than a number of well-known companies. Significantly, with a predetermined total number of 21 million coins, bitcoin was the first rare digital money ever established. The cost for a single bitcoin increased significantly for the first time in the cryptocurrency’s history in 2010, rising from a relatively small amount of money that is $0.09. The “halving” system reduces the regular source by 50% for four years when all 21 million coins have been produced. About 19 million coins have so far been produced, of which 5 million are thought to be stolen, 10 million are kept in long-term cold storage, and just over 3 million are traded on platforms. The viability of bitcoin as an asset class depends on its volatility.","Bitcoin’s uncertainty has been in a more steady rule since 2014, levitating between 50% and 100% and reducing for years. Crucially, cryptocurrency demonstrates fairly low correlation coefficients (roughly 0.1) to other asset categories, so the effect of its greater volatility is much more subdued in a wider scope investment. Before making even a small investment, it’s critical to conduct an in-depth study and gain a thorough understanding of how cryptocurrency operates. Make sure you select the appropriate platform from the many available options. Some cryptocurrency traders use websites to trade in a secure environment. Immediate Edge is one of the better choices out there, especially if you are just starting your crypto journey, as you will have the chance to be connected with an appropriate broker, who has the skills and resources to assist you in making better trading decisions.","The lowest value of Bitcoin in 2022 is less than $20 000 per a technical study of predicted price changes. The highest price that bitcoin may go is $41,180.91. The predicted average trading cost is $38,288.89.","The commonly traded Ethereum was established in 2015. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation and experienced a strong bull run in 2017. The total transaction costs for Ether increased significantly last November 2021, from $321 million in the third quarter of 2020 to $1.96 billion during the third quarter of 2021, according to the Bankless newsletter from expert Ben Giove. The complete transaction price rose as well, climbing up to about 398 per cent year over year to $536.48 billion in Q3 2021.","Ever since hitting its all-time peak, Ethereum has been having difficulties. Ether has been susceptible to the most current cryptocurrency collapse, much like Bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency market. Experts believe this might mark the beginning of another bull market because it has lately started to show indications of restoration. However, not everyone believes it will endure over time. Ether, however, was unable to maintain these record levels as December brought forth additional difficulties, causing the cryptocurrency to drop to a low of $3,628 at the end of the year.","Despite the fact that costs have already fallen, many traders remain confident that Ethereum will experience a similar or even greater increase in value than it did in 2021. According to some financial analysts, Ethereum will start trending downward and has already surpassed crucial support near $1,000. Ethereum and the larger crypto marketplace may be near the bottom after a six-month pullback. Ethereum may conclude the year at around $1500 if there is a recovery and investors purchase the drop.","Since its 2013 inception, Dogecoin’s price movement has been quite consistent with that of the market as a whole. It has fluctuated up and down with the general bull and bear market cycles. However, Dogecoin experienced the most price change in 2021, elevating it to the position of leading cryptocurrency investment.","Following the halving of Bitcoin in 2020, the crypto market began to surge, and Dogecoin began to gather upward speed. Elon Musk, one of the most powerful people in the cryptocurrency world, twittered about Dogecoin as the bull began to gather traction, which increased its momentum in relation to the whole market.","Dogecoin saw a full-fledged bullish trend by January 2021, which reached May 2021 at a record of $0.73. Dogecoin, unfortunately, was never able to return to its all-time peak levels of $0.73 after the general market drop that began in May 2021 and continued through July.","The initial Dogecoin price was $0.1719 in 2022. Dogecoin’s price dropped -34 per cent from the start of the year to $0.1127 as of today. Dogecoin is expected to cost $0.18 at the end of 2022, with a +5% year-over-year change. The increase from now to the end of the year is +60%. Experts anticipate that the price of 1 Dogecoin will be $0.17 by mid-2022. The cost of Dogecoin will increase to $0.19 during the first part of 2023; in the second quarter, it will increase by $0.00 and during the end of the year, the value will become $0.19, which is +69% greater than the price at present.","One important consideration when assessing crypto as an investment vehicle is its background and function as a reserve currency. Since the advent of quantitative easing in 2008, asset prices have risen significantly across the world. However, if we compare asset performance to G4 central banks ’ balance sheets, we can see that stock prices have been flat since 2008. In contrast, the value of gold, property investment, and all major world currencies has decreased. In 2008, just one asset—Bitcoin—surpassed the balance sheets of the G4 central banks.","The usage of digital currencies as a payment option is possible. A cryptocurrency transaction that is documented on a blockchain can be made by one person to the other. As a result, the crucial question is not about whether virtual currencies could be used as a mode of payment but rather whether they are, or might be, a serious threat to the potential of an asset.","Earlier in 2021, Elon Musk made headlines when he revealed that Tesla would purchase $1.5 billion worth of assets and Bitcoins and begin taking it as payment for its automobiles. This was just another significant milestone for Musk in the automobile sector.","In 2014, Microsoft was one of the first companies to take bitcoin as payment for the purchase of video games, applications, and other media products in the Microsoft Store for systems like Windows Mobile and Xbox.","It seems obvious that the business that pioneered contemporary online currencies will be the one to overpower Microsoft if anyone were to do so. About 3 months after PayPal joined in September 2014, Microsoft started accepting bitcoin in December of that same year.","In March 2020, Starbucks declared that it was supporting the bitcoin movement. Starbucks took a cautious approach to adopt cryptocurrencies as payment, just like what Etsy did. While you cannot use bitcoin to purchase frappuccinos in-store, you can add this to the Starbucks app, among other payment methods like gift card credits and frequent flyer credits. There are other companies that adopt Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment aside from the three big companies mentioned above. Because they recognise crypto assets as a significant alternative to any kind of transaction and given that big companies are using them, the price value will most possibly increase also.","The enthusiasm in cryptocurrencies is only starting, despite the fact that bitcoin leads the news today and that numerous valuation techniques demonstrate its enormous potential. At the very same moment, we must be aware of the significant vulnerabilities that the investment vehicle currently carries. Ventures are uncertain; even those who appear to offer endless good returns may falter in certain financial realities. All the more volatile are cryptocurrencies. Ease up while investing; according to some, the best traders have perfected the ability to keep their composure even when things appear to be getting out of hand."],"create_date":"2022-08-16T08:53:37+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

The rise of Ethereum, as well as networks focused on smart contracts, further extended the scope of this technology. Over the years, advances in the development of decentralized apps attracted new investors and users to the ecosystem.","Cryptocurrencies were not only a store of value or means of exchange anymore. The decentralized and perpetually available nature of blockchains allowed for the creation of marketplaces, virtual spaces, etc.","The number of possibilities boosted the growth of the sector. For this reason, analysts estimate that the blockchain technology market will be worth over 39 billion USD by 2025. Besides, almost one-third of this value will be invested in the banking sector. To access DApps, investors only need to buy Ethereum at an exchange and start participating in the crypto community.","Ethereum’s blockchain, the second-largest by market value, hosts the majority of dApps in the ecosystem. So, it requires a high throughput to process a large number of users. While this has been an issue in the past, Ethereum developers are working to improve and scale the network.","The road to scale the Ethereum network marked a major milestone with the transition from PoW to PoS mining. This reduced the fees charged by the network and the time it took users to wait for their transactions to be settled. But Ethereum still has room to improve, and it must do it to stay ahead of the competition. So, now developers are planning on implementing an upgrade known as The Purge.","This upgrade focuses on simplifying the Ethereum network. This feature, however, will not compromise decentralization. Instead, it will deepen it, by redistributing the history of the blockchain across different node groups. This is similar to the sharding process implemented on other blockchains.","To declutter the network, the upgrade will allow nodes to process transactions from checkpoints. This, in exchange, reduces the impact of the process on the devices of validator nodes. The Purge will also benefit nodes by removing fragments of code that remain from PoW mining. These are no longer necessary on PoS. The proposal also aims to improve smart contracts, by optimizing their codebase.","Ethereum is a very popular network for creating applications. These five crypto projects on Ethereum are used around the world, and there are a lot more with huge user bases. So it is important to create a functional network for them.","The goal of The Purge, as we said, is to optimize the network by reducing the historical data and streamlining the code bases. Let’s review how these features are implemented in detail.","In general, upgrades to the Ethereum network have been well received by the community. As a result of the congestion and scaling issues that took place in recent years, investors and developers have been eager to implement beneficial changes on the blockchain. These hard forks have been adopted by all nodes, and they have not resulted in network splits.","The Merge had a positive impact both on adoption and market price. Since The Purge is expected to draw in new nodes and foster the development of new dApps, we can assume that Ethereum will benefit from the upgrade. It will grow its user base and become more decentralized, and it will also see a surge in price.","As blockchain technology advances, developments in the industry also continue to grow. The competition in the smart contracts field has led Ethereum to focus on improving its infrastructure. The Purge is just another step in this process. Taking into account the number of competitors that have gained prominence in the last couple of years, it is no surprise that the community is implementing changes to maintain its position as the leading dApps blockchain."],"create_date":"2024-05-07T07:15:16+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

As the name suggests, its plan is to go safely to the moon and make holders (HODLers) generate huge profits. Its trading tax serves as an incentive to HODL SafeMoon tokens as long as possible, and it may as well increase its potential in the long run. SafeMoon also has a burning policy, where tokens are constantly burned. A lower supply often leads to a price increase.","While its price is relatively low due to the large supply, experts predict that the price of SAFEMOON can increase at large rates in the future. Here is what some of them think.","YouTuber Kyle Talks Money provides a careful analysis of SafeMoon (SAFEMOON) and how it works. He suggests that SafeMoon does not necessarily need to have an increase in the market cap for its price to increase at large rates. His implication is based on the argument that SAFEMOON tokens are constantly burned. By penalizing sellers and rewarding sellers, the total supply of SafeMoon is decreasing. As a result, its price increases without necessarily increasing the market cap. Therefore, a price of $0.01 is entirely possible for SafeMoon in the long run.","Mr. Bon’s also provides his analysis on SafeMoon (SAFEMOON). He calculates the time that you would need to become a millionaire with $100 of SafeMoon investment by taking into account SafeMoon’s burning rate. Based on his calculations, SafeMoon could reach $0.01 in the next ten years.","Crytonic predicts that SafeMoon can increase in the next five years, but not at very large rates. They believe that by 2025, SafeMoon can hit a price of around $0.00002, which is 10x the current price of SAFEMOON. However, they believe that by 2030, SafeMoon can go close to $1, especially if more than 30% of the total supply is burned by then.","Wjsnews gives another prediction on SafeMoon. They predict that SAFEMOON can be as high as $0.63 by 2030. By 2040, they believe that SAFEMOON can surpass $1 and reach as high as $1.85. Lastly, they predict that a price of $10 is only attainable by 2050 for SAFEMOON.","Crypto Academy gives a detailed analysis and prediction on SafeMoon for the next four years. They predict that the price of SafeMoon can reach up to $0.00005 in this bullish cycle. As for 2022, a price of $0.0001 is possible due to the upcoming projects that SafeMoon has. With its deflationary properties due to the burning mechanism, SAFEMOON could aim for $0.0007 in 2023. Decentralized Applications (DApps), as well as decentralized gaming, can put SafeMoon higher in the market rankings, as its price is predicted to go close to $0.003. Last but not least, they predict that by 2025, SAFEMOON can reach a price of $0.01 as the demand increases and as the BTC halving in 2024 takes full effect in the market."],"create_date":"2021-10-22T13:00:36+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Of course, having many options can often become confusing, especially if you are new to the market. For that reason, we decided to write an article to differentiate the types of exchanges, and help you choose what is best for you.","In the next few chapters we discuss the top 5 platforms you should be aware of, their unique offer, and how you can use them to the best of your abilities in order to effectively participate in the crypto revolution. Let’s delve in.","Coinbase, much like many minimalistic exchanges, are essentially a brokerage. This is also why the price of cryptocurrencies is slightly higher compared to, say, trading platforms. The US-based exchange was created back in 2012 by Brian Armstrong , and has since grown to become the first unicorn startup listed in Nasdaq.","Coinbase is ideal for beginners. It does not have complex products that confuse new investors, but you can still make use of charts, withdraw your funds to any other platform, and feel safe for the security of your funds. While most claim that it’s best to keep your funds off exchanges, the platform has already filed insurance with the FDIC for amounts up to $250.000. So if you are new to crypto and you are looking for an easy solution to get started, make sure you check the exchange of Coinbase, as well as its useful knowledge base.","Binance is a trading platform/exchange that was established just 4 years ago, in 2017. In a few short months, the platform exploded in popularity, setting the standard for other competing platforms. So what makes Binance the best option for traders? First of all, there are more than 500 trading pairs, allowing users one of the largest pool of options available. Aside from that, the exchange also has a decentralized alternative known as Binance Smart Chain, for users that prefer not to keep their funds on the centralized platform.","Aside from trading, the platform also offers many different products mainly oriented to passive income (Earn section), derivatives trading, IEOs, as well as their own unique cryptocurrency debit card.","The oldest and most established platform for peer to peer trades is none other than LocalBitcoins. For many, the concept is relatively scary, as they fear that trading directly with another, unknown person can result in scams. However, for years now, LocalBitcoins proves that the system is one of the best options for those who are looking to pay using less popular payment methods.","The concept is simple. A user creates an offer (either buy or sell bitcoin) at a particular rate, listing the payment method they wish to receive. The other party finds this offer, agrees to the trade, and makes a payment from the indicated payment system.","In order to ensure that both parties follow through, the platform acts as an escrow. This means that the bitcoin remains temporarily in the custody of LocalBitcoins until proof is provided that the payment is made. Once confirmation arrives, the BTC is sent to the person who bought it.","Choosing a peer to peer exchange is a great way to go around a potential banking ban for cryptocurrencies, which is the case with many countries, like Nigeria, India, and others.","Next, let’s talk DEXs. The concept of decentralized exchange platforms became popular in 2019, when China was cracking down on China-based exchanges. To avoid the single point of failure that comes with storing funds on decentralized exchanges, innovators had to think of a way that cryptocurrencies can be traded freely, without the need for KYC.","This is exactly what DEX stands for. Users don’t need to create an account, or store their funds on a platform. Every process of the protocol happens through smart contracts which ensure that both parties keep the end of their deal. Uniswap is one of the most popular options available and its token, UNI, is based on the Ethereum network, which is also used for the gas fees.","While these four options are the most popular ways to get crypto, note that buying with cash is not possible. For this reason, it is important to note that bitcoin ATMs, as well as dedicated, brick-and-mortar stores are also available to help you transact effectively. However, in both accounts remember that you will most likely have to verify your identity if the purchase is larger than $1000. Therefore, before you make any investment decision, make sure you conduct your own research and know what you are getting into. This article is merely written to provide an educational perspective.","To further educate yourself and stay up to date with the latest cryptocurrency news, check out Coinspeaker.com."],"create_date":"2023-02-23T11:55:06+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

The explosive growth of DeFi presents exciting opportunities to diversify investment portfolios while avoiding centralized entities.","Moving on to Dogecoin…","Dogecoin (DOGE) has gained popularity due to meme culture, offering high staking rewards and potential for long-term growth. Dive into the world of Dogecoin today!","Gaining popularity due to meme culture","Dogecoin has been gaining popularity among traders due to its association with internet memes. This has led to increased attention and investment, creating a unique buzz in the world of cryptocurrency.","The community-driven nature of Dogecoin, combined with its high staking rewards, presents an appealing opportunity for those seeking more than just financial gains.","Moving on from the meme culture phenomenon surrounding Dogecoin, let’s delve into the next best option for beginners—Bitcoin.","High staking rewards","Dogecoin offers high staking rewards, making it an attractive option for beginners looking to invest in cryptocurrencies.

To some people, these words could be new. Others think they mean the same. However, investing and trading are essential pillars of Bitcoin. They are also not the same.","Naturally, humans go for the most valuable things. From the moment a person learns to talk, walk, and interact, they haggle, exchange, and make deals that bring them the most value. Before humans invented physical money, people used a barter system to get what they needed or wanted by swapping what they had with what they didn’t have. Every item that humans used in a barter system had value.","What’s more, the value keeps changing depending on the object and how other people needed it, as well as its scarcity. Additionally, a person was better off with the items they got through barter trade than initially. And similar rules apply today when purchasing and selling items.","Investment and trading depend on humanity’s knack for getting what has value and considering its future value. In Bitcoin’s case, trading and investment have similar goals. People want to purchase and sell Bitcoin for a higher price than they use to acquire it. However, people use different strategies to trade Bitcoin.","Investment doesn’t provide a get-rich-quick option. An investment offers a way to accumulate wealth. When you invest in Bitcoin, you don’t focus on short-term profits. Instead, you purchase this virtual currency, hoping its value will increase over time. Once you opt to invest in Bitcoin, you don’t intend to spend or use your tokens soon.","An investor hopes to gradually grow a portfolio and make profits from holding onto this digital asset for some time. Crypto investors call this approach Hodling. Bitcoin investing is somehow unusual because an investor doesn’t pay greater attention to current affairs or news about the crypto market every day. Instead, they hold onto their Bitcoin through multiple price cycles. Thus, a Bitcoin investor won’t sell their digital asset when the price drops.","Most investors think that most assets’ prices increase over time. A Bitcoin investor can hold onto their digital currency for several reasons. For instance, an investment gets an early mover the biggest reward. Therefore, purchasing an asset before other people enables an investor to pay a lower price and make more profits upon selling it later. Another reason is that Bitcoin’s value will eventually increase as mainstream finance adopts it and prominent companies accept it as a payment method.","Bitcoin trading provides a way to accumulate wealth fast, provided you use an effective strategy. Trading is often a high-octane and fast-paced method of making money. A person trades Bitcoin on a medium or short-term basis. A Bitcoin trader follows events, news, and market activity throughout the day to monitor indications that hint at a potential change in Bitcoin price. The Bitcoin market is volatile. Therefore, a trader faces more risk than an investor.","When trading Bitcoin, you aim to purchase the virtual currency at a low price and then sell it when it increases its value. In most cases, this trading involves medium-sized trades. However, people can also engage in more significant transactions. Nevertheless, this trading comes with volatility and a dynamic force while settling into the worldwide market. But the volatility that surrounds Bitcoin trading provides a possibility for benefiting from high yields.","Both Bitcoin trading and Bitcoin investing was initially exclusive to the financial elites. However, things have changed, and almost anybody can trade or invest in Bitcoin. What a person needs to trade Bitcoin is a crypto exchange like Oil Profit, read our review about oil profit and a digital wallet. That way, a person can buy and sell or invest in Bitcoin using their smartphone anytime, anywhere."],"create_date":"2023-10-04T09:37:33+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Italy is one of the places where traditional casinos originated, and the Ridotto casino opened in Venice was a way of entertainment used to entertain people coming to the carnival at that time. It would not be wrong to think of it as the first legal casino open to the public. However, in other parts of Europe, casinos became widespread and popularized, while in the United States, of course, they were not lagging behind, developing their own casinos and building casinos that catered to the aristocratic class. But somewhere along the way they evolved into online casinos and we are going to give you some different information about how this process works, because with the development of online casinos, they diversified and crypto casinos emerged.","In fact, the popularity of online casinos is something that has emerged with the spread of the internet around the world. As the internet became more widespread in the 1990s, many different sectors started to move online, and the casinos that people physically went to gradually moved online. In 1994, with the first legal regulation, the way was paved for online casinos and this sector opened its doors to its customers. Of course, when these online casinos first appeared, they could not provide the same service to their players as they do now because the graphics were much more primitive than they are now.","However, as we get closer to the present day, these technologies have advanced considerably and are now able to cater to the modern demands of players. Nowadays, many different online casinos are emerging, including online casinos where you can pay with cryptocurrencies. These online casinos use different technologies that are designed to increase the security of the players and make their gaming experience easier and nowadays people are able to play interesting games with bitcoin thanks to these technologies.","There are actually many different advantages of using cryptocurrencies for players, and these advantages definitely improve the gaming experience. All of these advantages come about because all cryptocurrencies have their own unique features, which we’re going to talk about. When you transact with cryptocurrencies, you use a technology called blockchain technology, which is essentially blocks of data that are linked together cryptographically. Each block carries information about the block before it and they are connected to each other. At the same time, this information is processed on several computers that are also on the network. This makes it very easy to detect any problems in the blockchain. This blockchain technology actually helps players in a few different areas, one of which is that it ensures their importance.","","Players can play games and make deposits at online casinos without completely revealing their identity if they so wish. All of their personal and financial information will be kept private thanks to the blockchain technology we just mentioned. This is because, as we mentioned, the data contained in the blocks is cryptographically encrypted. Thanks to this encryption, it becomes unreadable and this prevents fraud. At the same time, different cryptocurrencies have different transaction fees, but they all have very low transaction fees compared to traditional payment methods because they eliminate third parties.","Thanks to these low transaction fees, crypto casinos have become very popular among players, and they are becoming more and more popular in this sector. This is not the only advantage besides low transaction fees, of course, when it comes to transactions. At the same time, the speed of transactions with almost all cryptocurrencies will be very fast and when you want to withdraw money, you will be able to do it instantly. With traditional payment methods, online casinos may sometimes give you a waiting period of days, but this is certainly not the case when you pay or withdraw with popular and niche cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Dogecoin.","","If we need to talk about other advantages of payments with cryptocurrencies, there are quite different advantages apart from the above, among which we can mention that cryptocurrencies are globally accessible because they are decentralized. Normally, when you want to pay at online casinos, not every payment method will be valid in every country, and if the payment method you use is not valid at the online casino, you will not be able to play there. But this is definitely not the case with cryptocurrencies, because these cryptocurrencies are valid all over the world, so people from all around the world will have the chance to play there.","There are other benefits to crypto casinos being such a global destination. Since these casinos cater to a wide audience, they always keep the wishes of their customers at the highest level and strive to meet their needs as soon as possible. On a site with this much traffic, the modern needs of customers are best met. In addition to this, again, since cryptocurrencies are decentralized, players can access greater comfort in legal matters because there is a possibility that countries may ban these games with their own money, but when it comes to cryptocurrencies, you will not be able to encounter such a problem because they are decentralized.","","Another point to mention is that thanks to blockchain technology, transactions can be made in a very transparent way. We have already talked about the blockchain process and how these blocks are protected and interconnected. These chains provide great transparency to players and casino owners, and any disruption in the chain is reported immediately, so the chances of you encountering any fraud or cheating are almost zero. In addition, with this technology, players can be sure that the game they are playing is fair and they know that they are randomly accessing the results.","One of the reasons why crypto casinos are becoming more popular and on the rise is the bonuses and promotions they offer players. These crypto casinos offer different bonuses to attract players and keep them on their websites, and all of these bonuses have different purposes and benefits. As this is a relatively new industry, the bonuses offered to players may be slightly different and juicier than the bonuses offered at regular online casinos. However, thanks to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, things can change and players’ winnings can change in a positive way.",""],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

It’s been a roller coaster, with highs that take your breath away and lows that can make you question everything. Let me walk you through some key moments in Bitcoin’s price history that stand out to me.","Bitcoin started off as an obscure digital currency, worth just a few cents. I remember when it first hit $1; we all thought it was incredible. Fast forward to 2013, and Bitcoin made headlines by reaching $1,000. At this point, more people started paying attention.","The year 2017 was unforgettable for any crypto trader. Bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 by mid-December. Many of us were ecstatic but also nervous about what might come next.","As expected, 2018 brought the crash. By February, Bitcoin had plummeted below $7,000. This was a tough time for many in the community.","Things started looking up again in 2020 during the pandemic. With traditional markets in turmoil, Bitcoin became a haven for some investors. It hit record highs above $60,000 in April 2021.","But crypto is known for its volatility. By July 2021, prices had fallen by half. This wasn’t new to seasoned traders like me; we knew to brace ourselves for ups and downs.","Cathie Wood’s prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1.48 million by 2030 gives many of us hope. Despite the daily fluctuations and risks involved, this potential keeps us glued to our screens.","The first three quarters of 2023 saw more stability in Bitcoin’s price than usual. We didn’t see dramatic peaks or troughs but rather a gradual upward trend.","Ethereum rallying 85% and Bitcoin gaining nearly 150% in 2023 shows the bullish momentum of the crypto market.","A report forecasting a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2024 excites me every day as I open my trading platform.","Predictions are one thing; experiencing the volatile journey of cryptocurrency trading is another. Each peak and valley has taught me something new about the market—and about myself as a trader.","Institutional adoption","Institutions are increasingly embracing cryptocurrency, with major companies and financial institutions integrating crypto into their investment portfolios. This shift is driven by the potential for high returns and diversification opportunities that come with including digital assets in traditional investment strategies.","As a result, institutional adoption has significantly contributed to the increased stability and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market, attracting more investors and traders. Furthermore, large-scale adoption by institutions has led to greater liquidity and reduced volatility in the crypto market.","Moving forward to “Environmental considerations” let’s explore how sustainability concerns impact the future of cryptocurrencies.","Environmental considerations","As a crypto trader, it’s important to understand the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. The energy-intensive process of mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has raised concerns about its carbon footprint.","With the increasing demand for computing power, more electricity is needed, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. This has prompted discussions around developing sustainable solutions for crypto mining to mitigate its environmental impact.","It’s essential for us as traders to be aware of these environmental considerations as they could influence regulations and market sentiments in the future. As we navigate through the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrency, considering these factors will be crucial for making informed investment decisions.","The future of crypto holds potential highs and lows, as well as varied predictions from other analysts. Is it a good time to invest?","Potential highs and lows","Crypto has seen significant highs, with Bitcoin gaining nearly 150% and Ethereum rallying 85% in 2023. However, it remains important to acknowledge the potential lows due to market volatility and uncertainty about future crashes.","Despite bullish momentum in 2024, fluctuations are expected as crypto remains prone to sharp rises and falls. It’s crucial for traders like us to stay informed and be prepared for both ups and downs in the market.","As an active crypto trader, I’ve observed firsthand the rapid price movements of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. While it’s exciting to see significant gains, it’s also important to exercise caution during periods of high volatility.","Other analysts’ predictions","As a crypto trader, it’s vital to stay informed about analysts’ predictions. Here are some insights from experts:","Is it a good time to invest?","It’s vital to consider investing in this bullish crypto market, given the recent 85% rally of Ethereum and nearly 150% gain of Bitcoin in 2023. With predictions of a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2024, along with growing public interest and decreased skepticism, it presents an opportune time to capitalize on the potential gains in the cryptocurrency market.","The stakes are high considering Cathie Wood’s staggering prediction of Bitcoin reaching $1.48 million by 2030 and the continued popularity of both Bitcoin and blockchain technology.","Given these factors, now might be an ideal time for traders to seize upon lucrative opportunities within the crypto market as it continues its upward trajectory.","The future of crypto is unpredictable, but the potential for a resurgence is evident.

At this point, more people started paying attention.","The year 2017 was unforgettable for any crypto trader. Bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 by mid-December. Many of us were ecstatic but also nervous about what might come next.","As expected, 2018 brought the crash. By February, Bitcoin had plummeted below $7,000. This was a tough time for many in the community.","Things started looking up again in 2020 during the pandemic. With traditional markets in turmoil, Bitcoin became a haven for some investors. It hit record highs above $60,000 in April 2021.","But crypto is known for its volatility. By July 2021, prices had fallen by half. This wasn’t new to seasoned traders like me; we knew to brace ourselves for ups and downs.","Cathie Wood’s prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1.48 million by 2030 gives many of us hope. Despite the daily fluctuations and risks involved, this potential keeps us glued to our screens.","The first three quarters of 2023 saw more stability in Bitcoin’s price than usual. We didn’t see dramatic peaks or troughs but rather a gradual upward trend.","Ethereum rallying 85% and Bitcoin gaining nearly 150% in 2023 shows the bullish momentum of the crypto market.","A report forecasting a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2024 excites me every day as I open my trading platform.","Predictions are one thing; experiencing the volatile journey of cryptocurrency trading is another. Each peak and valley has taught me something new about the market—and about myself as a trader.","Institutional adoption","Institutions are increasingly embracing cryptocurrency, with major companies and financial institutions integrating crypto into their investment portfolios. This shift is driven by the potential for high returns and diversification opportunities that come with including digital assets in traditional investment strategies.","As a result, institutional adoption has significantly contributed to the increased stability and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market, attracting more investors and traders. Furthermore, large-scale adoption by institutions has led to greater liquidity and reduced volatility in the crypto market.","Moving forward to “Environmental considerations” let’s explore how sustainability concerns impact the future of cryptocurrencies.","Environmental considerations","As a crypto trader, it’s important to understand the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. The energy-intensive process of mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has raised concerns about its carbon footprint.","With the increasing demand for computing power, more electricity is needed, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. This has prompted discussions around developing sustainable solutions for crypto mining to mitigate its environmental impact.","It’s essential for us as traders to be aware of these environmental considerations as they could influence regulations and market sentiments in the future. As we navigate through the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrency, considering these factors will be crucial for making informed investment decisions.","The future of crypto holds potential highs and lows, as well as varied predictions from other analysts. Is it a good time to invest?","Potential highs and lows","Crypto has seen significant highs, with Bitcoin gaining nearly 150% and Ethereum rallying 85% in 2023. However, it remains important to acknowledge the potential lows due to market volatility and uncertainty about future crashes.","Despite bullish momentum in 2024, fluctuations are expected as crypto remains prone to sharp rises and falls. It’s crucial for traders like us to stay informed and be prepared for both ups and downs in the market.","As an active crypto trader, I’ve observed firsthand the rapid price movements of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. While it’s exciting to see significant gains, it’s also important to exercise caution during periods of high volatility.","Other analysts’ predictions","As a crypto trader, it’s vital to stay informed about analysts’ predictions. Here are some insights from experts:","Is it a good time to invest?","It’s vital to consider investing in this bullish crypto market, given the recent 85% rally of Ethereum and nearly 150% gain of Bitcoin in 2023. With predictions of a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2024, along with growing public interest and decreased skepticism, it presents an opportune time to capitalize on the potential gains in the cryptocurrency market.","The stakes are high considering Cathie Wood’s staggering prediction of Bitcoin reaching $1.48 million by 2030 and the continued popularity of both Bitcoin and blockchain technology.","Given these factors, now might be an ideal time for traders to seize upon lucrative opportunities within the crypto market as it continues its upward trajectory.","The future of crypto is unpredictable, but the potential for a resurgence is evident. Analysts foresee remarkable highs and cautious lows in the next decade. With ongoing bullish momentum, investing might be worth considering.","The everchanging world of cryptocurrency continues to captivate both speculators and skeptics alike, leaving us all wondering about its long-term fate."],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Crypto arbitrage trading has become increasingly popular over the last few years, with many people successfully profiting from this activity. However, it can be difficult to understand what it is and how to start crypto trading.","In this article, we will explore how Crypto Arbitrage works, why you should or shouldn’t consider it as an investment opportunity, and how you can get started today!","In order to properly understand Crypto Arbitrage, we need a basic understanding of how crypto trading works. How do you get started with cryptocurrency trading? Crypto trading is similar to traditional stock market trading but with a few key differences. It can be done on many different platforms, including decentralized exchanges or centralized exchanges.","First, you need to decide which digital coin (or token) that you would like to trade and set up an account with the exchange where it is listed for sale. To maximize your chances of successful trading, you should look at charts and compare prices across exchanges, as well as monitor news about specific coins that may affect prices.","Crypto Arbitrage is a form of trading that allows you to make a profit on the price differences between different cryptocurrency exchanges. It can be difficult for new investors to understand and get started, but the concept isn’t as complicated as it might seem.","The key to understanding crypto arbitrage is knowing how different exchanges work and finding an opportunity to have a price difference in their currencies. This happens because cryptocurrency prices fluctuate constantly. Exchanges rarely have exactly the same prices.","There are three main types of crypto arbitrage: Spatial, Flash loan, and Triangular arbitrage.","Spatial arbitrage is quite straightforward. You simply look at one currency, for example Bitcoin, on two different exchanges. If the price varies, you can buy from the cheapest exchange and sell on the more expensive one in order to make money.","Flash loan arbitrage means that you take a large cryptocurrency loan without any collateral (security). The goal is to take advantage of differences in interest rates.","Triangular arbitrage involves three types of crypto. You trade in a “loop” so that you trade through each crypto until you’re back at the original one. The trades are usually carried out on the same exchange, using differences in spot rates to make a profit.","With crypto arbitrage, you have the possibility to make a profit quickly thanks to price differences and high volatility. You have lots of trading opportunities because of the large number of exchanges and currencies. There’s also less competition for crypto arbitrage compared to other financial instruments.","However, it does come with some risks. You need correct timing, and often larger amounts of money to get a significant profit. The key is starting small until you get used to how this type of trading works. You also need to consider fees – the costs of trading. Crypto arbitrage isn’t necessarily a get-rich-quick scheme, but it can be lucrative if you do your research and understand how the concept works!"],"create_date":"2021-09-01T07:40:08+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

However, reports also show that only about three percent of websites are embedded with the share button.","Unfortunately, that is something most business owners and internet and social media users haven’t realized. When people share online content with friends, they provide free advertising to the owners of the content, advertising that would necessarily cost them an arm and a leg on leading social media outlets for the amount of traffic they receive. What’s more, the advertiser has the benefit of social proof as friends trust friends and are more likely to look favorably at the content they recommend.","There hasn’t been a practical way to incentivize online content sharing. Under normal circumstances, such a content-sharing reward system would be too expensive, and intermediaries and high fees would make it out of reach. Thankfully, Sharpay has brought a practical system for rewarding users sharing online content by taking advantage of the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) aka blockchain, with its low or no fee micro-payments.","Sharpay is a blockchain-based system that rewards users with digital tokens (read a new way of mining cryptocurrencies) as an incentive for sharing online content. This automated system is a convenient way for rewarding website owners and social media users since both parties benefit mutually. People don’t put any effort to share content no matter how much they love it; the introduction of Sharpay is changing that. With Sharpay, whose mantra is “You Share, We Pay,” more websites are likely to integrate Sharpay buttons into their websites.","","","","","Sharpay buttons work just like the traditional content sharing buttons, and you can easily place them at your regular webmaster.

Everyone seems to understand the importance and follow the trend of investing in crypto. There are more than 21,000 cryptocurrencies in existence and over 130,000,000 tokens.","The leading technologies used to develop and grow new altcoins are based on the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains. Bitcoin has a limited number of tokens that the blockchain accepts. The limit is 21 million, and there are 19 million Bitcoin tokens in circulation.","Ethereum, however, offers an infinite supply. Currently, there are over 120 million tokens, and Polygon is one of them.","Polygon is developed on Ethereum’s blockchain, and its coin is MATIC. Like other newly made altcoins, it is a decentralized Ethereum scaling platform. This means that it also allows developers to build scalable, user-friendly dApps with minimal transaction fees and better security.","Simply said, this crypto is used as a cryptocurrency payment method for paying the network’s transaction fees.","Some of Polygon’s scaling protocols are:","You can invest in Polygon on every trading platform.","Its market capitalization is $624,690,227 USD at this moment and it has a $279,845,363 USD 24h volume. The token is limited, and the total supply of the MATIC token is 10,000,000,000, and over 8,040,000,000 MATIC tokens are already in circulation.","Polygon’s tokens are also divided into several functional categories on the market: 16% are team tokens, 12% are network tokens, 24% are in the ecosystem, and 4% are advisors. The remaining tokens are for the foundation.","Every crypto enthusiast would like to know if Polygon is worth investing in. Some people and businesses consider it an excellent investment, and others are not convinced about that.","Many companies and high-profile businesses launched projects on Polygon. Meta, Adobe, fashion companies such as Dolce & Gabanna and Prada, and online casinos commenced future projects with this altcoin.","It might seem bizarre at first that a cryptocurrency caught the eye of the gambling industry. MATIC is an improved token with a low market cost. This reason attracted many online gambling establishments, such as The Draft Kings, to invest and accept it as a valid payment method.","Another reason is the functionality. Polygon is forked from Ethereum, and people have known how it works for quite some time now. Gamblers that wager with crypto are used to Ethereum and can change the coin easily. Naturally, casinos want to find suitable solutions to ensure their guests’ safety and fast payment methods.","Polygon has real potential to become one of the favourite coins in gambling and other industries. It is safer, faster to mine, and cheaper than Ethereum, but it works the same way, so people are drawn to it. It has promising potential and many projects and dApps to develop in the near future.","At the same time, Polygon, like every other cryptocurrency, is volatile. The price of MATIC will not surpass $1, as some experts say, but the volatility still happens.","Investors and the coin’s developers have numerous plans for the future, but nothing is granted. The token can lose its value, or even the Ethereum blockchain network can decline and drop its popularity rates. This affects every coin on that blockchain, including MATIC.","You can invest in Polygon and be updated daily about the new projects, the price, and how many tokens are in circulation. If you decide on buying a supply of MATIC, don’t forget the golden rule of crypto investments: Don’t put in more than you can afford to lose."],"create_date":"2022-09-14T07:28:53+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Modern consumers and companies don’t prefer cash payments. Instead, they prefer contactless payments. More people are also using smartphones, and this has prompted companies to accept mobile and internet transactions. And the emergency of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has made things more interesting.","Today, almost everybody wants to buy, sell, or invest in Bitcoin. And you can attribute this to the growing popularity of this digital currency. Bitcoin was the first electronic currency to go mainstream. Although other digital currencies emerged afterward, Bitcoin remains the most popular among them. Currently, the world has over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and developers are creating more. Unfortunately, some people invest in electronic currencies without understanding how they work.","Bitcoin is an electronic payment system and money that does not depend on third parties like banks. Instead, this virtual currency provides a peer-to-peer system, allowing people to receive or send money from any part of the world. Rather than use physical cash, people send bitcoins online using their computers and smartphones. A public ledger records transaction details when a person transfers funds.","Electronic money developers gave it the name cryptocurrency because it verifies transactions using encryption. That means transmitting and storing cryptocurrency data involves advanced coding. People can store Bitcoin in digital wallets and access transaction data in public ledgers. The encryption involved in cryptocurrency provides safety and security.","But like other investments, Bitcoin comes with risks. Some experts say that Bitcoin presents a riskier investment because of its price volatility. But this virtual currency is among the hottest commodities to invest in today. If planning to venture into Bitcoin investments, here are safety tips to guide you.","Most people access Bitcoin through crypto exchanges. Platforms allow people to purchase and sell this electronic currency with ease. You can pay for Bitcoin with fiat money using different payment methods. Upon buying your Bitcoin, you can transfer it to your digital wallet and use it to pay for services and goods.","But, crypto exchanges are not the same. That’s why you should exercise caution when purchasing Bitcoin. Ideally, research a cryptocurrency exchange before registering and using it to buy or sell Bitcoin. Read reviews to gain insights into what other users say about a platform before you use it to purchase Bitcoin using your hard-earned money.","Although you can keep Bitcoin in a crypto exchange, a digital wallet provides safer storage. That’s because a cryptocurrency exchange doesn’t prioritize safety. Instead, it aims to help you buy and sell Bitcoin with ease. A digital wallet, on the other hand, provides a safe place for storing Bitcoin. However, you can choose from a wide range of wallets, and each has its pros and cons. Take your time to research different digital wallets to select the most appropriate based on your needs.","Bitcoin has a highly volatile market. Therefore, prepare for this volatility when starting to invest in this electronic currency. Prices will exhibit dramatic swings. So, if your mental wellbeing or portfolio can’t withstand this volatility, Bitcoin may not be a suitable investment for you.","Bitcoin has captured the attention of many retail investors. Almost everybody with access to the internet is thinking about investing in this digital currency. That’s because early adopters are constantly sharing their success stories. But safety is a significant concern for most people that want to invest in this virtual currency. Following these tips will enable you to participate in Bitcoin trading or investing without losing your hard-earned money. You can also get more tips from experts on how to invest in cryptocurrencies from home."],"create_date":"2023-10-04T09:35:00+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

The technology is the basis for cryptocurrencies as it allows for fast transfers and clear records that prevent mistakes and erroneous transfers.","In this article, we’ll go over the most important blockchain protocols that investors should be aware of and how they differ. The basic technology behind all of them is the same, but there are different uses, leading the crypto protocols to find quite distinct user bases. An investor, however, should look into the whole field and diversify their investment by both use and value.","Bitcoin is the first and the largest cryptocurrency out there. It’s the gold standard for the industry and the first cryptocurrency that has gone truly mainstream and was accepted by traditional financial institutions, such as banks and ETFs.","However, traditional financial institutions have also criticized one of the features of its protocol – how decentralized it is. For some users, however, the fact that no centralized institution controls Bitcoin is the whole point.","The Bitcoin network uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. It requires the users to provide computation power to the network and validate transactions while providing security.","Ethereum is the second-largest crypto protocol and has managed to find its way to traditional financial markets and create its own ETFs. Ethereum network is especially well-designed to run and build applications based on smart contracts.","Smart contracts have found their application and use in almost every industry, as they allow automated transfers and self-executing arrangements. For complex industries with a lot of moving parts, such as logistics and shipping, smart contracts enable the users to send the payments when each point of the process is completed. It reduces loss and makes the process smoother.","Binance is a blockchain network launched by the crypto exchange of the same name. It’s one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, measured by the amount of funds traded and the number of cryptos that use it.","This protocol allows for transferring large amounts of data within a short time. This makes the network very scalable and allows it to grow. It’s a key feature now when there’s a wide crypto adoption. Proof of stake is also much more energy efficient than the alternative proof-of-work.","Cardano is a blockchain platform mostly used for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It’s based on the proof-of-stake mechanism called Ouroboros. A mechanism such as this allows the users to validate their transactions simply by holding and using their tokens.","It’s the most energy-efficient protocol out there and, therefore, the most eco-friendly. It’s one of the most important features for crypto users who are tech-savvy and otherwise care for their carbon footprint. Cardano also uses a modular architecture that allows it to change and adapt to new apps.","Polcadot is a unique protocol that focuses on multi-chain uses. The network is built for interoperability between different blockchain systems. Users see this feature as one that’s oriented towards simplicity and ease of use. There are plenty of blockchain networks in use, and investors and everyday users are looking for the ability to transfer funds between different blockchains.","This is done using a security model that works equally well regardless of which blockchain is used. It’s a smaller protocol but one that will expand in the years to come as the need for multi-chain transfers becomes more important.","Solana has one of the most powerful proofs of stake protocols. It allows for thousands of transactions per second to be processed at any time. With the new interest in crypto and wide adoption, such platforms are much needed, and they gain new users every day.","Solana is also a crypto protocol that places special emphasis on developer adoption. It provides several tools and resources to help developers build on the platform. The network uses both proof of stake and proof of history consensus mechanisms. It’s an innovative mechanism developed by Solana Hub.","Chainlink is what’s called an Oracle network that is somewhat similar to Bitcoin. Oracle systems connect data from the outside world (off-chain) with the blockchain world (on-chain). It uses the data to supply smart contracts with a wide array of information. Data includes weather reports and predictions, stock prices, and public ledgers. All of these are used to inform financial decisions.","For a while, users have been trying to utilize the automation that comes with using blockchain networks to process a lot of information at once quickly. The network is built on Ethereum and utilizes zero-knowledge proof.","Cosmos is a decentralized network that uses independent blockchains. It enables easy transfer of assets and information between different blockchains. The network provides a common security network with a shared security model. The transactions made using this protocol are safe and secure.","Cosmos is especially well-liked in the industry that focuses on decentralized finance projects. Cosmos focuses on scalability and interoperability, which are the features that are most needed in the world of decentralized finance. The Cosmos exchange platform has a coin called Atom. It’s on the rise, as is the case with most altcoins, but it’s not widely used.","Tron is a decentralized crypto platform that’s used to create decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ethereum is the most popular crypto in this field, but there are many altcoins on the rise that work based on the same principles and provide a unique service. Tron is one such altcoin that focuses on the entertainment industry applications. It was first based on Ethereum, and in 2018, it switched to its own network.","It’s a platform on which content creators can publish, store, and monetize their digital content. The creators can use a crypto coin called TRX to make payments and the Tron blockchain to automate payments.","Hive is a blockchain protocol that uses a design similar to that of decentralized social media. It allows for fast and safe transactions. It also features a strong community of creators and curators. Hive is focused on community collaboration and engagement among users.","The network uses proof of stake, which means that it uses ownership of coins to verify transactions and networking. It often calls itself a cryptocurrency for Web 3, and it’s made for decentralized networks and smart contracts. The HIVE crypto itself isn’t among the most widely used coins.","There are many different crypto protocols out there that investors should be aware of. The rise and wide adoption of cryptocurrencies have also led to increased interest in smaller and niche altcoins. Now, when traditional finance institutions use Bitcoin and Ethereum, they are also getting a spotlight.","When investors are looking for cryptos to focus on, they should look for something more than price and value. How a protocol is used and what market it covers are also important indicators of how sound the investment is."],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Since then, this unique currency has become a vital requirement in the iGaming market. Consequently, nowadays, many operators offer cryptocurrency as a payment method. Amongst the other options, Bitcoin is the most popular digital currency method among casino enthusiasts. However, there are more cryptocurrencies that have different values and benefits to boost gambling experience.","There are 5 common crypto gambling currencies that are available in the iGaming industry. Most of the casinos, which offer digital currency, support these options for their players. In this article, you can find informative details about these methods and try to elaborate on the basic concepts regarding crypto wallet and crypto payment. Keep reading to find out the best online casinos that support crypto and other digital currency solutions.","Bitcoin casinos are so much alike the standard casinos you can find with a quick search. Moreover, they are more advantageous in terms of providing faster and more secure transactions. Although making a deposit or withdrawal with Bitcoin is slightly different than traditional currencies, you will get used to it in no time thanks to easy use.","You can have a look at a variety of Bitcoin casinos listed on Casino Bee to find out the most rewarding one among them. Moreover, Casino Bee provides players with reviews of a number of different cryptocurrency casinos evaluating them from many aspects.","The cryptocurrency portfolio is more significant than you can imagine.

The dynamics of these two different worlds are completing each other, considering various aspects. Using digital currency for online casino money transactions makes things a lot easier for online casino players.","First of all, you know that banking solutions are always skeptical when it comes to paying for online casinos. Moreover, using traditional deposit and withdrawal methods can be very time-consuming. Sometimes, it takes days to process a transaction using these methods. In this regard, cryptocurrencies offer relatively fast and secure transactions as the banks and government have no control over these currencies. The deposits and withdrawals take place instantly with digital currencies.","Secondly, blockchain offers transparency and privacy at the same time during money-related issues. Cryptocurrencies do not ask for the complete reveal of the identities, which enables a certain degree of anonymity. Moreover, they keep the transaction history all the time with transparency to prevent fraudulent activities.","Last but not least, cryptocurrencies require highly reasonable transfer fees. Moreover, it is possible to see negligible transaction fees, unlike traditional solutions. If you get tired of the expensive payment system, cryptocurrency is one of the best solutions. It is a way to reduce costs for the costly gambling system.

The information provided is not directed at or intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity located within the UK. The financial products and services mentioned in this article are not eligible for the UK. Cryptoassets are classified as Restricted Mass Market Investments in the UK, meaning that they are high-risk investments and are not suitable for most retail investors.","In the world of cryptocurrency, one fundamental aspect that sets it apart is the irreversibility of transactions. Bintense, a prominent player in the online crypto exchange arena with expertise, knowledge, and authority in the crypto domain, stands as a beacon in providing insights into why crypto transactions remain irreversible.","The cornerstone of irreversibility in crypto transactions lies within the blockchain technology powering it. Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralised and distributed ledgers, where transactions are bundled into blocks and linked chronologically. Once a block is added to the blockchain, altering any transaction within becomes computationally infeasible due to the cryptographic hash functions and consensus mechanisms, supporting immutability.","Cryptographic techniques in blockchain technology play a pivotal role in ensuring the integrity of transactions. Each transaction is verified through complex mathematical algorithms, creating a digital signature that uniquely identifies the parties involved. Attempting to alter a transaction would require recalculating the cryptographic hash for that specific block and all subsequent blocks, rendering it practically impossible.","Decentralisation, a key feature of cryptocurrencies, minimises the reliance on central authorities. Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), checks that participants agree on the validity of transactions. This distributed consensus makes it challenging for any single entity to reverse or manipulate transactions without the majority’s approval.","Understanding the irreversibility of crypto transactions is not just a matter for tech enthusiasts or industry experts; it holds profound significance for everyday users engaging in crypto for common daily needs. Here’s why this knowledge is crucial:","For users making routine purchases or transactions using cryptocurrencies, knowing that these transactions are irreversible adds a layer of double-check. In the fast-paced world of digital transactions, mistakes can happen. Knowing that crypto transactions are irreversible prompts users to pay extra attention to details before confirming, reducing the likelihood of accidental errors that could have financial consequences.","Many individuals use cryptocurrencies for peer-daily needs such as buying/selling goods or services. Sellers can be confident that it cannot be rescinded once a payment is made, promoting fair exchanges. The immutability provided by blockchain technology limits chances for unauthorised actions and fraud.","As cryptocurrencies become more integrated into daily life, users must adopt a sense of financial responsibility. Acknowledging the permanence of crypto transactions encourages users to manage their digital assets prudently, fostering a proactive and informed approach to personal finance.","In essence, whether buying your morning coffee, selling items online, or engaging in routine financial transactions, knowing why crypto transactions are irreversible empowers you to navigate the crypto landscape confidently and securely in your daily life.

Crypto arbitrage trading has become increasingly popular over the last few years, with many people successfully profiting from this activity. However, it can be difficult to understand what it is and how to start crypto trading.","In this article, we will explore how Crypto Arbitrage works, why you should or shouldn’t consider it as an investment opportunity, and how you can get started today!","In order to properly understand Crypto Arbitrage, we need a basic understanding of how crypto trading works. How do you get started with cryptocurrency trading? Crypto trading is similar to traditional stock market trading but with a few key differences. It can be done on many different platforms, including decentralized exchanges or centralized exchanges.","First, you need to decide which digital coin (or token) that you would like to trade and set up an account with the exchange where it is listed for sale. To maximize your chances of successful trading, you should look at charts and compare prices across exchanges, as well as monitor news about specific coins that may affect prices.","Crypto Arbitrage is a form of trading that allows you to make a profit on the price differences between different cryptocurrency exchanges. It can be difficult for new investors to understand and get started, but the concept isn’t as complicated as it might seem.","The key to understanding crypto arbitrage is knowing how different exchanges work and finding an opportunity to have a price difference in their currencies. This happens because cryptocurrency prices fluctuate constantly. Exchanges rarely have exactly the same prices.","There are three main types of crypto arbitrage: Spatial, Flash loan, and Triangular arbitrage.","Spatial arbitrage is quite straightforward. You simply look at one currency, for example Bitcoin, on two different exchanges. If the price varies, you can buy from the cheapest exchange and sell on the more expensive one in order to make money.","Flash loan arbitrage means that you take a large cryptocurrency loan without any collateral (security). The goal is to take advantage of differences in interest rates.","Triangular arbitrage involves three types of crypto. You trade in a “loop” so that you trade through each crypto until you’re back at the original one. The trades are usually carried out on the same exchange, using differences in spot rates to make a profit.","With crypto arbitrage, you have the possibility to make a profit quickly thanks to price differences and high volatility. You have lots of trading opportunities because of the large number of exchanges and currencies. There’s also less competition for crypto arbitrage compared to other financial instruments.","However, it does come with some risks. You need correct timing, and often larger amounts of money to get a significant profit. The key is starting small until you get used to how this type of trading works. You also need to consider fees – the costs of trading. Crypto arbitrage isn’t necessarily a get-rich-quick scheme, but it can be lucrative if you do your research and understand how the concept works!"],"create_date":"2021-09-01T07:40:08+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

A distributed ledger is used to keep and maintain a database of transactions. Its usage in digital currencies is only the beginning, and experts believe that this technology can revolutionise investments. Blockchains are a lot similar to digital spreadsheets in which you can customise them however you want. Even today,the technology is being adopted by large grocery stores like Walmart to make their supply chain management more efficient. They use blockchains to keep track of their food products to help prevent any food contamination or spoilage from happening.","But how exactly can they change how we make investments? There are a lot of different ways that they can do so.","For starters, if blockchain technology were to be applied, then the processing time for post- trade settlements will be nearly instantaneous. The process for post trade settlements averages at about three days due to the numerous intermediaries involved for each transaction. If the transaction was made on a distributed ledger, then the trade can be programmed to be fully automated and instantaneous, taking settlement time from 3 days to just minutes or even seconds. Check out Cryptogeek for more in-depth reviews about blockchain companies.","Trading costs will also be affected. If processes were automated and intermediaries were removed from the picture, trading costs would fall. Consequently, investors would also benefit from lower trading costs. At the moment, it’s believed that the trading market shells out up to $150 billion per year for banking expenses and post-trade security services. These costs can be lowered if blockchain technologies were to be used in the trading market.","Adopting blockchains would also mean that trading could be done 24/7, all days of the week. Using distributed ledgers would enable exchanges all over the world to be open 24 hours every day of the week. Trading will no longer be affected by factors like time zones and geographic boundaries. This could also potentially change how troubleshooting and crises are handled since there will always be an active part of the network at any given time.","What else? Well, distributed ledgers would allow all of its users to view the full record of all transactions. This would give more transparency and grow trust in the trading market. Each trade that would happen will just be added to a block in the chain and anyone will see the records. Not only that but blockchains could also be programmed to monitor and regulate transactions to automatically detect and block any suspicious or illegal activity in the network. This not only increases transparency but increases trust as well.","Communications are also expected to be improved with the adoption of blockchains. Once transparency and trust have grown, this effect can trickle down onto investors and investment managers. Since information on trades and account transactions can be accessed and relayed more easily, investment account managers can monitor their clients’ portfolios in real time. The use of blockchain can also help make the onboarding process easier by granting access to profile information using secure and encrypted keys. Like this, institutions can also have an easier (and faster) time transferring their assets to one another.","Here’s a secure and easy to use trading platform that can help you get set up with the right tools for trading crypto.","And lastly, blockchains can help investors see more liquidity. Having blockchains in place would save investors from the arduous administrative tasks that come with transferring share ownership for complex assets like real estate. If all of the information on transactions were recorded on the blockchain, that would remove the need for all the headache inducing paperwork and administrative tasks involved. This reduces the lock-in period that comes with a lot of private investments, giving investors the chance to have control over how long they want to participate in those aspects of their portfolios."],"create_date":"2023-10-04T09:59:43+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Discover how innovations are shaping a more environmentally friendly future for the digital currency world.”","Cryptocurrency has caught everyone’s attention with its promise to make money handling more secure and private. Yet, creating these digital coins, a process called “mining,” uses lots of power and harms our environment. It’s interesting to see how even non-traditional platforms like the 1xbet site, known for online betting, are getting on board with cryptocurrencies. This shows how widespread digital currencies are becoming and highlights the urgent need for environmentally friendly ways to produce them.","Crypto mining is key for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to work. It involves powerful computers solving complicated math problems. When these puzzles are solved, transactions are confirmed, and new coins are made. But, this requires a ton of electricity, raising concerns about its impact on our planet.","The search for green crypto mining has brought about smart new ideas. These ideas aim to reduce the harm mining does to the environment.","The technology behind cryptocurrencies, called blockchain, is also changing to support eco-friendly mining. Two important changes are:","– Proof of Stake (PoS): This new method doesn’t need miners to solve difficult puzzles, which cuts down on energy use. Instead, people are chosen to confirm transactions based on how much cryptocurrency they’re willing to lock away as a security deposit.","– Layer 2 Solutions: These are new layers added to the existing blockchain to speed up transactions and make them more efficient. This means less work for miners and less energy needed for mining.","The path to sustainable crypto mining is full of potential but also some big challenges. The focus moving forward includes:","Think of crypto mining as a huge global challenge of puzzle-solving. The old way of running this challenge is like keeping a large building’s lights on all the time. It uses too much energy and harms our Earth. What if we could keep the challenge going but use less energy? Or even use energy from the sun, wind, or water? That’s the goal of these new approaches.","Moreover, by simplifying the puzzles or altering the rules so they require less energy to solve, we take a significant step forward. This is what the latest blockchain technologies are designed to do.","Exploring sustainable crypto mining shows us that moving towards eco-friendly methods is good for the Earth. It also opens up new paths for innovation and economic development. Embracing sustainability isn’t just necessary; it’s an opportunity to change the way we use technology and energy in today’s digital world.","Adding renewable energy to crypto mining does more than cut carbon emissions. It also makes green energy more available and efficient. As crypto mining asks for more renewable energy, it speeds up the growth and use of clean energy technology. This could result in:","Eco-friendly mining can do more than just save the environment. It can also help communities grow. For example, the extra heat from mining can be used to warm buildings or help plants grow. This can boost local economies and provide important services. Plus, moving to greener mining methods can create jobs in clean energy. This offers people new skills and work chances all over the world.","To make eco-friendly crypto mining common, we need to teach and spread awareness. A lot of people don’t know how mining affects the environment or that greener options exist. By educating everyone, from everyday folks to crypto industry insiders, we can help them make better choices. Holding workshops, seminars, and sharing information online can really help share this knowledge. This way, we can build a community in the crypto news world that cares about being sustainable.","The future of sustainable crypto mining news is not only promising but also essential for the continued growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. As we look ahead, several developments could further enhance the sustainability of crypto mining:","The push for eco-friendly crypto mining news is part of a bigger trend. It’s about the tech world getting serious about protecting the environment. The crypto mining folks are showing us how tech and nature can get along. They’re using new ideas, working together, and sticking to eco-friendly ways. This effort is shining a light on a path that other industries can follow. As we move forward in the digital age, making crypto mining more sustainable is inspiring. It gives us hope. If we all pull together, aiming for a cleaner future, our tech advances will do more than just boost our economy. They’ll also keep our planet healthy for many more years.",""],"create_date":"","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Predicted market values by 2026 range from $100,000 to more than $500,000 utilising four effective techniques of pricing: the gold pricing technique, stock-to-flow approach, organisational participation strategy, and high-net-worth participation technique. The stock-to-flow concept failed completely to precisely measure the value of bitcoin.","Given that this asset class is still in its infancy, investors should take a variety of technical indicators into account when determining its great possibilities.","Most crypto users are familiar with the history of Bitcoin’s pricing. This currency has developed into one of the largest assets in the globe from just being absolutely almost insignificant. Bitcoin’s market cap peaked even greater than a number of well-known companies. Significantly, with a predetermined total number of 21 million coins, bitcoin was the first rare digital money ever established. The cost for a single bitcoin increased significantly for the first time in the cryptocurrency’s history in 2010, rising from a relatively small amount of money that is $0.09. The “halving” system reduces the regular source by 50% for four years when all 21 million coins have been produced. About 19 million coins have so far been produced, of which 5 million are thought to be stolen, 10 million are kept in long-term cold storage, and just over 3 million are traded on platforms. The viability of bitcoin as an asset class depends on its volatility.","Bitcoin’s uncertainty has been in a more steady rule since 2014, levitating between 50% and 100% and reducing for years. Crucially, cryptocurrency demonstrates fairly low correlation coefficients (roughly 0.1) to other asset categories, so the effect of its greater volatility is much more subdued in a wider scope investment. Before making even a small investment, it’s critical to conduct an in-depth study and gain a thorough understanding of how cryptocurrency operates. Make sure you select the appropriate platform from the many available options. Some cryptocurrency traders use websites to trade in a secure environment. Immediate Edge is one of the better choices out there, especially if you are just starting your crypto journey, as you will have the chance to be connected with an appropriate broker, who has the skills and resources to assist you in making better trading decisions.","The lowest value of Bitcoin in 2022 is less than $20 000 per a technical study of predicted price changes. The highest price that bitcoin may go is $41,180.91. The predicted average trading cost is $38,288.89.","The commonly traded Ethereum was established in 2015. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation and experienced a strong bull run in 2017. The total transaction costs for Ether increased significantly last November 2021, from $321 million in the third quarter of 2020 to $1.96 billion during the third quarter of 2021, according to the Bankless newsletter from expert Ben Giove. The complete transaction price rose as well, climbing up to about 398 per cent year over year to $536.48 billion in Q3 2021.","Ever since hitting its all-time peak, Ethereum has been having difficulties. Ether has been susceptible to the most current cryptocurrency collapse, much like Bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency market. Experts believe this might mark the beginning of another bull market because it has lately started to show indications of restoration. However, not everyone believes it will endure over time. Ether, however, was unable to maintain these record levels as December brought forth additional difficulties, causing the cryptocurrency to drop to a low of $3,628 at the end of the year.","Despite the fact that costs have already fallen, many traders remain confident that Ethereum will experience a similar or even greater increase in value than it did in 2021. According to some financial analysts, Ethereum will start trending downward and has already surpassed crucial support near $1,000. Ethereum and the larger crypto marketplace may be near the bottom after a six-month pullback. Ethereum may conclude the year at around $1500 if there is a recovery and investors purchase the drop.","Since its 2013 inception, Dogecoin’s price movement has been quite consistent with that of the market as a whole. It has fluctuated up and down with the general bull and bear market cycles. However, Dogecoin experienced the most price change in 2021, elevating it to the position of leading cryptocurrency investment.","Following the halving of Bitcoin in 2020, the crypto market began to surge, and Dogecoin began to gather upward speed. Elon Musk, one of the most powerful people in the cryptocurrency world, twittered about Dogecoin as the bull began to gather traction, which increased its momentum in relation to the whole market.","Dogecoin saw a full-fledged bullish trend by January 2021, which reached May 2021 at a record of $0.73. Dogecoin, unfortunately, was never able to return to its all-time peak levels of $0.73 after the general market drop that began in May 2021 and continued through July.","The initial Dogecoin price was $0.1719 in 2022. Dogecoin’s price dropped -34 per cent from the start of the year to $0.1127 as of today. Dogecoin is expected to cost $0.18 at the end of 2022, with a +5% year-over-year change. The increase from now to the end of the year is +60%. Experts anticipate that the price of 1 Dogecoin will be $0.17 by mid-2022. The cost of Dogecoin will increase to $0.19 during the first part of 2023; in the second quarter, it will increase by $0.00 and during the end of the year, the value will become $0.19, which is +69% greater than the price at present.","One important consideration when assessing crypto as an investment vehicle is its background and function as a reserve currency. Since the advent of quantitative easing in 2008, asset prices have risen significantly across the world. However, if we compare asset performance to G4 central banks ’ balance sheets, we can see that stock prices have been flat since 2008. In contrast, the value of gold, property investment, and all major world currencies has decreased. In 2008, just one asset—Bitcoin—surpassed the balance sheets of the G4 central banks.","The usage of digital currencies as a payment option is possible. A cryptocurrency transaction that is documented on a blockchain can be made by one person to the other. As a result, the crucial question is not about whether virtual currencies could be used as a mode of payment but rather whether they are, or might be, a serious threat to the potential of an asset.","Earlier in 2021, Elon Musk made headlines when he revealed that Tesla would purchase $1.5 billion worth of assets and Bitcoins and begin taking it as payment for its automobiles. This was just another significant milestone for Musk in the automobile sector.","In 2014, Microsoft was one of the first companies to take bitcoin as payment for the purchase of video games, applications, and other media products in the Microsoft Store for systems like Windows Mobile and Xbox.","It seems obvious that the business that pioneered contemporary online currencies will be the one to overpower Microsoft if anyone were to do so. About 3 months after PayPal joined in September 2014, Microsoft started accepting bitcoin in December of that same year.","In March 2020, Starbucks declared that it was supporting the bitcoin movement. Starbucks took a cautious approach to adopt cryptocurrencies as payment, just like what Etsy did. While you cannot use bitcoin to purchase frappuccinos in-store, you can add this to the Starbucks app, among other payment methods like gift card credits and frequent flyer credits. There are other companies that adopt Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment aside from the three big companies mentioned above. Because they recognise crypto assets as a significant alternative to any kind of transaction and given that big companies are using them, the price value will most possibly increase also.","The enthusiasm in cryptocurrencies is only starting, despite the fact that bitcoin leads the news today and that numerous valuation techniques demonstrate its enormous potential. At the very same moment, we must be aware of the significant vulnerabilities that the investment vehicle currently carries. Ventures are uncertain; even those who appear to offer endless good returns may falter in certain financial realities. All the more volatile are cryptocurrencies. Ease up while investing; according to some, the best traders have perfected the ability to keep their composure even when things appear to be getting out of hand."],"create_date":"2022-08-16T08:53:37+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}

Since then, this unique currency has become a vital requirement in the iGaming market. Consequently, nowadays, many operators offer cryptocurrency as a payment method. Amongst the other options, Bitcoin is the most popular digital currency method among casino enthusiasts. However, there are more cryptocurrencies that have different values and benefits to boost gambling experience.","There are 5 common crypto gambling currencies that are available in the iGaming industry.

Yes, we are talking about none other than PayPal, which is touted as the Goliath of online payment in today’s time.","Since its inception back in 1998, PayPal quickly rose into fame and donned the crown of one of the most promising digital payment platforms and service providers at an international level. Not only in the field of finance, this company carved a niche for itself in the iGaming industry as well.","Since then PayPal has been embraced by a number of online casinos, thereby solidifying its stature and prominence as a reliable ally for the gaming aficionados and pulling up the overall stock prices.","But lately, things are looking haywire for PayPal as the company is slowly slipping out in terms of overall market share and payment volume, thereby infusing strong tension amongst the investors.","But is it just another story concocted about investment jitters and market volatility or something more alarming looming in the air? If things are taking a bad turn for PayPal, what should be the company’s strategy to escape this problem? Let’s try to find out more in this post below.","The stage is all set for PayPal and the dark cloud of woe and worry have surrounded the investors of this company, which was once hailed as undisputed king in the financial market.","The last quarter hasn’t been good and it has shaken the investment space with varying shifts in price, with clouds of uncertainty, which in turn is causing the investors’ hearts to come to their mouths. Recently, the fourth quarter results were declared and it thoroughly disappointed the investors.","PayPal has been experiencing the rage of the market since 2023, and it showed the early symptoms of the decline. But what is the reason for this downturn? In this very year, the figures of the company were hampered by slow revenue growth, bad leadership and less than expected profits. There were frequent changes in the leadership which in turn jolted the business while the rise in stiff competition and regulatory challenges de-accelerated the sales growth.","The doubts in the minds of investors intensified during the market sentiment downturn. This in turn led to the re-assessment of PayPal’s place in the fintech ecosystem. While the financial reports of 2023 were far from average, PayPal started investing its energy and focus in building innovation and improving operational excellence, which was evident in the last quarter’s report.","The moves in PayPal’s share in recent quarters have added a pinch of tension among the investors. While the company’s quarter-four results could not satisfy its profit appetite, the results are somewhere fine. It hints that PayPal is working internally to resolve the root causes of its decline, paving the way to a better future. However, with such a slow growth rate, it will definitely take a bit longer to return to the roads of stability.","Despite the storm of uncertainty surrounding PayPal Holdings Inc., its latest financial reports offer a glimpse of hope for investors. The reports highlight a 9% pull in revenue to $8 billion in the fourth quarter, crushing expectations of $7.33 billion.","While the outer figures look super promising, the problem lies under the surface. The flat transaction margin of $3.7 billion points to slower growth, which turned out to be the reason to snatch away the smiles of the investors. The more haunting factor is the decline of active accounts by 2% to 426 million.","Finally, the investors can enjoy a breath of relief with the new CEO, Alex Chriss, stepping into the spotlight and unwrapping the next move of PayPal. With 2024 set as an investment and transition year, the company intends to launch new projects and strengthen its core technology infrastructure, particularly by solving latency concerns on its mobile app. Chriss’s vision lays the groundwork for a profitable future by polishing the company’s offerings.","The world of fintech and digital payments has been experiencing enormous growth in recent years. But PayPal has significantly failed to walk in parallel with this market, squeezing out big profits. PayPal presently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 11, indicating that Wall Street is particularly pessimistic about the company’s growth prospects.","But amidst the chaos and speculation, there is always a window of opportunity for PayPal to rewrite the narrative and reclaim its position in the industry. With a new leader in the driving seat, an unrelenting drive, and a dose of luck, PayPal may still rise from the shadows and into the sunshine again."],"create_date":"2024-04-23T16:11:14+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Post"}
