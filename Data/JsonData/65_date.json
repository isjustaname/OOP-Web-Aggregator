The YoY headline CPI data came in at 3.4%, exactly in line with market forecasts. The MoM headline figure even outperformed the 0.4% estimate, finishing 0.1% lower.","Furthermore, the core CPI data has cooled down for the first time in six months. Investors responded to the optimistic CPI by taking long bets in stocks and cryptocurrencies, since the possibility of interest rate reduction this year has increased, as per Cryptodaily.","CPI Report Bolsters Cryptocurrency Market Amid Rising Expectations for Fed Rate Decreases","Today\u0027s CPI report has tremendous implications for cryptocurrency pricing. It is vital to note that negative macroeconomic data halted the first quarter crypto bull run. Fed Chair Jerome Powell took a dovish position in his most recent post-FOMC address, which boosted cryptocurrency prices. However, the market likely required additional confirmation of declining macroeconomic concerns, which today\u0027s CPI statistics give. As previously said, the possibility of interest rate decreases this year, which appeared grim a few weeks ago, has now significantly increased. The CME FedWatch now predicts two rate decreases in 2024, one in September and the other in December.","","Bitcoin is currently trading at $64,400, up 4% today. AI currencies have been the most spectacular, with the AI crypto market value up 6% today. Tokens like Render, Near Protocol, and The Graph are up 8%, while Bittensor is up 13%. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades indicates that the reason for AI outperformance could be that they were aggressively shorted prior to today\u0027s CPI. However, the AI industry is largely projected to be the most bullish domain during current bull market. Experts predict that large-cap AI cryptocurrencies would outperform all other sectors, while new AI coins may yield 100x returns.","WienerAI ($WAI) Draws Investor Attention with Promising 100x Profit Potential","The excitement surrounding new meme coins has prompted investors to focus on WienerAI ($WAI), a new AI-powered meme coin that experts predict will generate 100x profits. Meme coins are most likely the only cryptocurrencies that can outperform AI coins. Given that $WAI is at the intersection of two of the most popular narratives, the grandiose 100x price projection may not be too farfetched. The new token is off to a fantastic start in its presale, having raised over $1.8 million in the first three weeks.","","Investors are drawn not only to WienerAI\u0027s unique mascot, which is a cross between a sausage, a dog, and an AI hybrid, but also to its cutting-edge functionality. The WienerAI trading bot is unlike any other companion. It is intended to answer all trading-related queries while facilitating frictionless swaps and offering MEV protection. The meme currency also has its own staking algorithm, which currently provides a reward rate of more than 500%. Interested customers can purchase $WAI through the WienerAI website\u0027s over-the-counter widget.","Photo: Microsoft Bing","TokenPost | [email protected]","<Copyright © TokenPost.

Many traders miss out on significant market moves by selling at inopportune times. Benzinga reports on a prime example involving a Dogecoin (DOGE) investor. One of the largest DOGE wallets over the past decade sold its tokens in late 2023, just before one of the largest DOGE price surges in recent years.","The wallet began acquiring DOGE in late 2013, 21 days after the token\u0027s launch. An initial investment of $146.87 netted over 274,000 DOGE tokens. Throughout 2014, the wallet continued to acquire tokens with investments ranging from a few cents to a few hundred dollars, totaling around $5,000 by the end of 2014. The final investment of $195.61 was made in early 2015, after which the wallet remained inactive until 2023.","","During the hiatus from 2015 to 2023, DOGE\u0027s price skyrocketed, particularly in 2021 when social media buzz and attention from Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk propelled the token from less than 1/100 of a cent to nearly 75 cents. At its peak, the $5,000 investment was worth over $4 million, but the wallet owner did not sell.","","DOGE\u0027s price plummeted throughout 2022 and 2023, losing over 90% of its value due to the overall crypto bear market, which saw most tokens lose more than 50% of their value. Just as DOGE began to recover, the wallet\u0027s owner sold all the tokens on October 28, 2023, through three transactions, generating proceeds of approximately $370,000 for 5.39 million DOGE.","","Shortly after the sale, DOGE and other meme coins surged. DOGE is up more than 60% year to date and over 120% since the sale. At its peak in 2024, DOGE reached 23 cents, over 235% higher than the 6.8 cents average price the tokens were sold for. If the wallet had held the tokens until now, it would have seen an additional $450,000 in gains. Selling at the 2024 peak would have resulted in nearly $900,000 in total gains, with proceeds of $1.25 million.","TokenPost | [email protected]","<Copyright © TokenPost.

The launch marks a milestone in the field of blockchain technology, offering promising solutions for Ethereum\u0027s scalability issues.","The much-anticipated ALT token and the claiming process were officially made available to the public as of Jan. 25, 9 am UTC, as per Cointelegraph. A staggering 300 million tokens were allocated for the initial airdrop, resulting in a total value of approximately $96 million based on the current average daily price of $0.32 per token.","However, Celestia stakers eager to participate in the ALT airdrop will have to exercise patience as AltLayer reported technical differences delaying the distribution to Celestia. Despite this delay, AltLayer\u0027s airdrop comes at a time when several other projects are also expected to distribute their respective tokens to eligible recipients within the same timeframe.","Dymension and Jupiter to Follow Suit","According to ADVFN, among these projects is Dymension, a multilayer rollup deployer poised to launch its mainnet in the near future. Dymension plans to airdrop 70 million DYM tokens, primarily benefiting Celestia stakers and Pudgy Penguin NFT holders, as well as participants in the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems.","Furthermore, the Solana-based decentralized exchange Jupiter has confirmed the launch of its highly anticipated JUP token on Jan. 31. A total of 1 billion tokens will be distributed through the airdrop, making it potentially worth around $410 million based on the current pre-market trading price of approximately $0.41 per token.","Bitcoin Ordinals Users Could Benefit from Airdrop","In addition, Bitcoin Ordinals users may also have an opportunity to participate in an airdrop. Ordinals developer Leonidas recently announced the launch of \"Runestone,\" a decentralized \"fairdrop\" initiative designed to reward early users of the Ordinals protocol. The airdrop aims to incentivize users\u0027 early adoption and engagement.","While airdrops offer exciting possibilities, crypto users must exercise caution. The X platform is currently plagued by scam accounts posing as crypto firms\u0027 official social media pages announcing airdrops. Users must remain vigilant to avoid falling victim to these fraudulent schemes.","Photo: Traxer/Unsplash","TokenPost | [email protected]","<Copyright © TokenPost.

Their research suggests that if the price of BTC fails to significantly increase after the halving, these miners could find it difficult to operate profitably.","Implications of a Price Stagnation on Bitcoin Miners","","Cointelegraph reported that a Jan. 25 post from CleanSpark executive chairman and co-founder Matthew Shultz, referring to Cantor Fitzgerald\u0027s research, highlights the potential pressure on Bitcoin miners post-halving. Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and Core Scientific are among the miners that may be affected, as the revenues generated may not cover their operational costs.","","ADVFN noted that while Bitcoin miners\u0027 revenues are closely tied to the price of Bitcoin, Luxor executives emphasize that miners often employ strategies to hedge against potential losses stemming from price volatility. These strategies involve mitigating the risks associated with Bitcoin\u0027s fluctuating value.","","Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Hut 8 mining, based in the United Kingdom and Florida, respectively, are projected as potentially unprofitable after the halving. At the current Bitcoin price, their \"all in\" cost-per-coin rate is $62,276 and $60,360, respectively. Hut 8 reports a reserve of 9,195 BTC, amounting to $377 million at current prices.","","Maintaining Profitability Amidst Challenging Market Conditions","Among the miners assessed by Cantor analysts, Singapore-based Bitdeer and United States mining firm CleanSpark are expected to maintain profitability post-halving. However, this is based on an average Bitcoin price of $40,000 and no significant changes in the hash rate.","","Cantor\u0027s metric refers to the total costs incurred by Bitcoin miners in producing a single coin. This includes electricity costs, hosting fees, and other cash expenditures necessary for mining operations.","Scheduled for April, the Bitcoin halving will reduce the mining rewards by half. While many market pundits view this reduction as bullish for Bitcoin\u0027s long-term price, it also poses challenges for miners with high operational costs. A failure to reach a price level that covers these costs could exacerbate the situation.","Strategies Employed by Bitcoin Miners to Mitigate Risk","Dan Rosen, the associate director of derivatives at Bitcoin miner Luxor, explains that miners often rely on various strategies to hedge their exposure to BTC. This typically involves purchasing derivative products like hash rate futures.","Market commentators speculate that Bitcoin will likely experience a significant price surge in the months following the halving, which may help alleviate the challenges miners face. However, the overall outcome remains uncertain.","Photo: Kanchanara/Unsplash","TokenPost | [email protected]","<Copyright © TokenPost.

The new legislation, approved on May 13 and set to take effect on November 1, prohibits the state government from restricting or impairing the use of cryptocurrencies for purchases and self-custody.","The law ensures that neither state nor local governments can impose additional taxes specifically targeting cryptocurrencies. Instead, cryptocurrencies will be subject to the same taxes as legal tender. This measure aims to foster a more favorable environment for crypto transactions and investments within Oklahoma.","HB 3594 also provides significant protections for crypto mining activities. It legalizes both home and industrial crypto mining operations, allowing businesses to operate in areas zoned for industrial use. While local governments retain the authority to change zoning designations for mining businesses, they must provide proper notice and allow for appeals. The law also prevents local authorities from imposing specific noise restrictions on crypto mining operations, though general noise and data center regulations will still apply.","The Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the state\u0027s public utilities commission, is prohibited from creating discriminatory rate schedules for crypto mining companies. Additionally, the law exempts parties engaged in mining, staking, and operating blockchain nodes from obtaining a money transmitter license, simplifying the regulatory landscape for these activities.","The Oklahoma Bitcoin Association lauded the legislation, noting that it makes Oklahoma the first state to codify the rights of its citizens to run nodes, mine, and self-custody their Bitcoin. Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Act Fund, praised the bill for addressing what he described as an \"onslaught of attacks\" on self-custody rights.","This legislative move by Oklahoma comes as other states, such as Arkansas, have imposed restrictions on crypto mining, often citing noise pollution as a concern. On a national level, efforts like Senator Elizabeth Warren\u0027s Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act aim to impose similar restrictions on activities related to unhosted wallets, digital asset miners, and validators.","Oklahoma\u0027s HB 3594 sets a significant precedent in protecting cryptocurrency activities, potentially serving as a model for other states looking to create a more supportive regulatory environment for the burgeoning crypto industry.","TokenPost | [email protected]","<Copyright © TokenPost.

This significant achievement has propelled the government\u0027s total bitcoin holdings to a staggering $354 million at current prices.","","The country\u0027s “Bitcoin Office,” an official government institution, has strategically increased the government\u0027s bitcoin holdings to a substantial 5,750 bitcoins. This significant increase in holdings reflects the government\u0027s confidence in the future of cryptocurrencies.","","Since September 2021, the latest additions, 473.5 bitcoins worth almost $29 million, have been powered by a modest amount of geothermal energy generated by the country\u0027s enormous Tecapa volcano. This eco-friendly approach to acquiring the well-known cryptocurrency, which is not regulated by a national bank, is a testament to El Salvador\u0027s commitment to sustainable practices.","","President Nayib Bukele, a fervent Bitcoin enthusiast, has been instrumental in promoting the country\u0027s Bitcoin mining activities. His administration, which was re-elected for a second term earlier this year, has installed 300 computers to \u0027mine\u0027 bitcoins from the volcano. This proactive stance underscores the government\u0027s commitment to the cryptocurrency and its potential benefits.","","The state-owned power facility generates 102 megawatts (MW), with 1.5 MW dedicated to cryptocurrency mining. The so-called crypto mining process necessitates massive amounts of energy for computing and cooling data processing centers, which compute complex math calculations to protect coins like Bitcoin. El Salvador Faces Criticism for Bitcoin Adoption Amid Global Scrutiny on Crypto Mining’s Environmental Impact","","In other parts of the world, cryptocurrency miners have recently received growing attention for their energy-intensive operations and impact on power networks and carbon emissions.","El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal money in 2021, following the adoption of the US dollar two decades prior. The adoption of the volatile cryptocurrency by Nayib\u0027s government drew heavy condemnation, especially from the International Monetary Fund.","","According to the Federal Bitcoin Office, cryptocurrency miners Foundry USA, Ant Pool, ViaBTC, F2Pool, and Binance Pool combined their resources to win a reward for establishing a blockchain verifying the last three years of Bitcoin transactions coming from the power plant.","Photo: Microsoft Bing","TokenPost | [email protected]","<Copyright © TokenPost.

This unfortunate breach occurred on October 29 and led to the loss of approximately $560,000, which was held in various memecoins by Unibot users.","On October 31, Scopescan, a firm specializing in blockchain analytics, alerted users to the breach at Unibot. They discovered that an exploit in a recently released Unibot contract had siphoned off cryptocurrency assets from multiple users. Unibot addressed the situation, stating that their system detected an issue in token approval within their new routing system, leading them to suspend this router to address the matter.","While Unibot and specialized blockchain investigators continue to investigate the breach, Scopescan has proactively recommended remedial measures. They strongly advised users to revoke permissions associated with the compromised contract and transfer their assets to a more secure digital wallet. This recommendation is based on Scopescan\u0027s data, which shows that the cybercriminal is currently converting the illicitly acquired memecoins to Ethereum (ETH).","In the wake of this distressing incident, the market showed visible unrest. This was evidenced by a sudden 43% drop in the value of the UNIBOT token within just 60 minutes, with its price plummeting from $57.6 to a low of $32.9. Encouragingly, the token has shown signs of a price recovery at present.","In response to the unfortunate incident, Unibot has taken a responsible stance by assuring reimbursement to all users who suffered financial losses due to the contract breach. A closer examination of transaction data over the past week reveals that digital currencies like UNIBOT, Joe (JOE), and BeerusCat (BCAT) accounted for a significant portion of the stolen amount.","Additionally, Scopescan has revealed that another address, strikingly similar to the one used in the breach, has been established and is actively employed to deceive and strip assets from unsuspecting individuals.","TokenPost | [email protected]","<Copyright © TokenPost.

This spike follows a big listing announcement on Revolut Business, Europe\u0027s largest neobank and retail trading app, raising expectations for additional price appreciation.","","However, it is worth mentioning that the meme coin has recently gained substantial traction, thanks to a flurry of listing and other related developments.","","The FLOKI price has increased by about 14%, signaling a return of interest among market participants. Notably, the recent announcement that FLOKI is now available on Revolut Business has been the critical impetus for this spike. This important milestone allows businesses across Europe to purchase FLOKI, quickly increasing its visibility and acceptance.","","Meanwhile, the revelation of FLOKI\u0027s inclusion on Revolut Business comes amid a flurry of other listing announcements, highlighting the meme coin\u0027s growing popularity and global reach. Notably, FLOKI just obtained listings on the Thailand subsidiary of Binance, the primary cryptocurrency exchange, increasing its traction in various geographic regions, including the Asian market.","","Conversely, the FLOKI cryptocurrency has gained traction after joining Bitpanda\u0027s Meme Coin Leaders Index, adding to the market\u0027s growing optimism. Bitpanda, a prominent multi-asset exchange based in Europe, confirmed the inclusion of Floki Inu into its renowned index.","Notably, the Bitpanda index is intended to represent a diverse portfolio of the top meme coins based on market value. FLOKI\u0027s inclusion in the index is a crucial milestone, as it increases its awareness and highlights its growing relevance within the meme coin ecosystem.","Floki DAO Proposes Major Token Burn, Driving FLOKI Price Up 14% Amid Strong Investor Support","Amid these listing successes, the Floki DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization guiding Floki Inu\u0027s development, has proposed a token burn. This proposal permanently removes almost 15 billion tokens from circulation, bolstering bullish feelings and driving the meme coin\u0027s price upwards.","Meanwhile, as of this writing, voting on the token burn proposal began on May 14 and will continue until May 16, with 99.8% of votes now in favor of the burning initiative. Notably, token burns act as a means to limit a cryptocurrency\u0027s overall supply, typically resulting in increased scarcity and demand, potentially propelling further price appreciation for FLOKI in the coming days.","During this writing, the FLOKI price rose 14.52% to $0.0002192 after reaching a 24-hour high of $0.0002229. Its trade volume increased by over 75%, reaching $886.48 million in the same period.

The progress is considerable, given that the sum was about $500 million at the beginning of the year.","","PEPE\u0027s surge confirmed its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency in the meme coin sector. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is in second place with a market capitalization of $14 billion, while Dogecoin (DOGE) tops the pack with more than $21 billion.","As expected, PEPE\u0027s comeback has rewarded investors.

It was exactly 15 years ago when the enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, introduced the revolutionary concept of Bitcoin. In an online message to a group of cryptographers, Nakamoto unveiled a groundbreaking electronic cash system that promised transactions without the involvement of any central authority.","In the announcement, Nakamoto described the new system as a fully decentralized peer-to-peer network, designed to address issues like double spending that had plagued previous digital currencies. The proposal involved a network of nodes that would authenticate and record transactions, implementing a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This innovative system was initiated on January 3, 2009.","This monetary platform was one of the pioneering applications of cryptography to free money from government control. Nakamoto\u0027s creation enabled individuals to conduct transactions, bypassing traditional banks and financial institutions, and connecting users globally.","A significant moment in Bitcoin\u0027s history occurred in May 2010 when Laszlo Hanyecz completed one of the first documented transactions using Bitcoin, purchasing two pizzas for a then-staggering 10,000 BTC.","In its early stages, the media primarily associated Bitcoin with illegal activities. However, over time, Bitcoin\u0027s reputation has evolved. Its global adoption has surged, highlighted by El Salvador\u0027s official recognition of Bitcoin as a legal currency in September 2021. Moreover, financial giants in the United States are exploring the introduction of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, while several European institutions have already launched their own.","To enhance Bitcoin\u0027s potential and capabilities, various advancements have been introduced. The Lightning network, initiated in 2018, aimed to increase transaction speeds by moving some processes off the primary blockchain. The value of Bitcoin has experienced significant fluctuations, with its price initially measured in pennies. As of now, its value stands at $34,250, a considerable decrease from its all-time high of $69,000 on November 10, 2021.","TokenPost | [email protected]","<Copyright © TokenPost.

Investors have recently lost about $150 billion, with the cryptocurrency market valuation falling from $2.42 trillion to $2.28 trillion. Bitcoin and altcoins failed to maintain their upward momentum and continue to tumble due to a lack of trading volumes in spot and futures markets.","Has the market trend shifted as cryptocurrency attempts to overcome macroeconomic concerns?

The index fell from 71 to 64 in three days, with technical charts indicating weakness.","Crypto market selloff as Bitcoin price loses momentum","Bitcoin\u0027s price fell below $62,000 in US hours as traders took profits or liquidated long positions. The Bitcoin price has fallen by more than 5% this week, with a 1% loss today, May 8. Trading volume has decreased considerably in the recent 24 hours, Coingape reported.","Bitcoin fell due to various factors, including hawkish pronouncements from Fed officials such as Neel Kashkari, a regulatory crackdown, an impending option expiry, and weak trends. Despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u0027s dovish comments and favorable economic data from last week, the recent remarks have spooked the cryptocurrency market.","The maximum pain price for Bitcoin this expiry is $62,000, and traders expect a crash if the BTC price falls below that level. Pull bets are particularly strong on the days after expiry, with important levels of 62,500 and 60,500 to watch. Despite this, economists remain hopeful about Bitcoin\u0027s price rise this year as stagflation concerns subside.","Meanwhile, the US dollar index (DXY) rose three days to 105.50, its highest level since mid-November. Traders are waiting for fresh comments from Fed officials on market direction and the economic outlook. According to current evidence, the Fed will likely decrease interest rates in September.","Furthermore, the US 10-year Treasury yield (US10Y) rose today to 4.481%. As Bitcoin swings in the opposite direction of the DXY and Treasury rates, the increase in numbers suggests that pressure on Bitcoin remains high.","Bitcoin is consolidating and has to break above $63,700 immediately to recover and $70,000 to surge, effectively ending the crypto market selloff.

Daily active addresses and transaction volumes have also risen, though less dramatically.","","This metric surge coincides with a SHIB price rally, making it one of the market\u0027s top performers, with a 7% increase in the last 24 hours. Other meme coins, including PEPE (23%), POPCAT (27%), TRUMP (22%), and FLOKI (12%), have seen even more significant gains.","","The recent SHIB price rebound can be attributed to the increasing burn rate and the ongoing development of Shibarium, a unique layer-2 scaling solution. Over the past week, the Shiba Inu team has burned more than 200 million tokens, with a 100% increase in the last 24 hours, including an additional 30 million tokens sent to a null address. This innovative burn mechanism aims to reduce SHIB\u0027s circulating supply, thereby increasing its scarcity and potential value, a feature that sets it apart from other meme coins.","","Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution for Shiba Inu, has undergone two significant enhancements. These improvements aim to improve user experience by making transactions faster and cheaper, and compatibility with popular wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. This means that users can now easily manage their SHIB tokens using their preferred wallets, enhancing convenience and accessibility. Shiba Inu Gains Traction as CoinGate and Nexo Integrate SHIB, Boosting Adoption and Use Cases","","CoinGate, a bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional finance, has integrated SHIB with Polygon and Binance Smart Chain, opening up a world of possibilities for businesses. This integration allows companies to buy, sell, manage, and accept cryptocurrency payments, providing a practical use case for SHIB. CoinGate\u0027s partnerships with well-known companies such as Airbnb, Spotify, Nike, IKEA, Walmart, and Uber further enhance SHIB\u0027s visibility and potential for widespread adoption.","","Nexo, a crypto lending platform, has recently enabled users to acquire Shiba Inu. This integration offers several benefits, including instant card transactions, the ability to earn rewards through exchanges, the option to borrow against the token, and the convenience of sending assets to friends via phone number or email.

Despite his past involvement with BlackRock\u0027s Bitcoin ETF, Ramji believes crypto products remain inconsistent with Vanguard\u0027s approach.","Vanguard’s New CEO, Salim Ramji, Reaffirms the Firm’s Stance Against Launching a Spot Bitcoin ETF, Citing Investment Philosophy","According to Cointelegraph, the new CEO of U.S. investing behemoth Vanguard has stated that he will not reverse the company\u0027s decision not to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.","","Vanguard\u0027s new CEO, Salim Ramji, the former head of BlackRock\u0027s global ETF division, told Barron\u0027s in an interview published on May 15 that the company values consistency and that crypto-related financial products do not fit its \"investment philosophy.\"","","\"I think it\u0027s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer,\" said Ramji.","\"I have heard [chief investment officer] Greg Davis\u0027 explanation and I think it is entirely consistent with Vanguard\u0027s investment philosophy. It is a logical and consistent point of view,\" he added.","Ramji handled the January launch of BlackRock\u0027s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which now manages $18 billion in assets.","He has openly professed his interest in cryptocurrency, and his transfer to Vanguard has sparked speculation about the changes he may make at the firm.","Along with BlackRock\u0027s ETF debut, rivals Fidelity and nine other investment managers established spot Bitcoin funds, which have received over $12 billion in net inflows. With $8.6 trillion in AUM, Vanguard took a different strategy and did not develop a Bitcoin ETF, regarding cryptocurrency as a speculative investment and an immature asset class. Vanguard\u0027s Stance on Bitcoin ETFs Under Scrutiny as Competitors See Positive Inflows","","Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart stated in a May 15 X post that he does not believe Ramji would launch a Vanguard spot Bitcoin ETF.","However, Seyffart stated that Ramji may reconsider the firm\u0027s prohibition of clients from purchasing other spot Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform. In March, Tim Buckley, Vanguard\u0027s outgoing CEO, stated that a Bitcoin ETF is inappropriate for a long-term retirement strategy since it is a speculative asset.","","His comments responded to customer pressure following the debut of competitor firms\u0027 Bitcoin ETFs.","In January, a handful of Vanguard clients threatened to close their accounts because the firm banned access to Bitcoin ETFs.","Meanwhile, Vanguard was indirectly exposed to Bitcoin through its investment in MicroStrategy, where it is the second-largest institutional shareholder.","Rival investing businesses are celebrating again as flows turn positive following Bitcoin\u0027s 7% rally to regain $66,000 on May 16.","According to preliminary Farside Investors statistics, net inflows for May 15 across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs exceeded $300 million, excluding BlackRock\u0027s IBIT, the results of which had yet to be announced.","Photo: Microsoft Bing","TokenPost | [email protected]","<Copyright © TokenPost.

Notably, market investors were keenly anticipating the U.S. CPI data, particularly with the recent U.S. PPI statistics showed that inflation has risen faster than predicted. Meanwhile, inflationary pressure has weighed on investor morale, with expectations growing over the Federal Reserve\u0027s probable hawkish attitude.","U.S. CPI and Core CPI Show Moderate Gains, Indicating Persistent Inflation Concerns","","Recent data from the U.S. The Labor Department said that the U.S. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.3% in April, falling short of market estimates of 0.4%. Notably, the CPI climbed at the same rate as the previous month. Unadjusted, the U.S. CPI, a key metric for understanding inflation levels, rose 3.4% year on year (YoY), in line with market expectations. Simultaneously, the Core CPI, excluding food and energy prices, climbed 0.3% on a monthly basis, matching Wall Street expectations. On a year-over-year basis, the Core CPI increased 3.6% after rising 3.8% in the previous month.","","Notably, although appearing to be cooling, inflation remains above the Fed\u0027s 2% target range, dragging on global investor mood. Despite this, investors appear to be praising the better-than-expected results. For context, the most recent U.S. PPI inflation figures came in higher than expected. Following that, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell restated the central bank\u0027s position on their rate hike plans.","Powell Hints at Steady Interest Rates Amid Persistent Inflation and Market Volatility","On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that inflation is still high, and that the central bank may keep interest rates steady for a lengthy term. Notably, inflationary pressures have kept a number of investors on the sidelines, resulting in increased market volatility. However, the fresh CPI data appears to have provided some relief to investors, reducing concerns about the Federal Reserve\u0027s more hawkish stance. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there is a 96.9% possibility that the central bank will maintain current interest rates during their June meeting.","","Meanwhile, in response to the CPI statistics, the US 10-year bond yield decreased 2.07% to $4.354, while the U.S. The Dollar Index dropped 0.42% to $104.455. Despite the jump in PPI inflation statistics, which has stoked fears, it appears that investors are focusing on other areas for the time being. For comparison, the Bitcoin price increased 3.48% during writing and was trading at $63,656.35, having reached a 24-hour high of $63,773.87 in the previous 24 hours. The one-day trading volume of the flagship cryptocurrency also increased by 8.77% to $27.82 billion.","","Additionally, the Bitcoin Futures Open Interest (OI) increased by 1.75% in the last four hours to 474.38K BTC, or $30.25 billion, according to CoinGlass statistics. This demonstrates that investors are still adjusting their risk-bet appetite following the lowering inflation figures.","Photo: Microsoft Bing","TokenPost | [email protected]","<Copyright © TokenPost.
