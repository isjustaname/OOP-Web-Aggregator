ZachXBT’s investigation identified 12 Solana memecoin projects that have been deserted by their founders, leaving investors in the lurch. Solana Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko expressed skepticism towards the trend, stating, “Pre-selling a meme doesn’t make any sense to begin with.” Yakovenko previously cautioned against investing in memecoin pre-sales, highlighting the riskiness of such endeavors. Of the 22 projects initially scrutinized, ZachXBT revealed that 12 have already been deserted within a month. Notable among these are LIKE, MOONKE, FROG, TEMPLE, and SORRY, which collectively raised over $2 million. Other projects, including those like @Jared_eth, raised substantial funds without even launching a token, with one account flagged as compromised by the web3 security platform Pocket Universe. The memecoin frenzy has now shifted to the Coinbase-backed Base blockchain, indicating a lack of lessons learned from the Solana debacle, according to ZachXBT. Meanwhile, the price of SOL, Solana’s native token, has witnessed a significant decline since the memecoin boom. Although SOL surged to over $200 during the peak of the frenzy, largely fueled by memecoin speculation, it has since plummeted to $154 as of the latest data. This represents a 23% decrease, despite SOL having already bounced back approximately 30% from its recent low of $117 on April 13.

The sentiment within the crypto community regarding the trajectory of Bitcoin’s price appears to be turning bearish, according to metrics derived from social media activity. This trend, historically observed, often coincides with market bottoms. As American poet and novelist Charles Bukowski famously remarked, “The masses are always wrong. Wisdom is doing everything the crowd does not do.” This adage holds true in the realm of cryptocurrency, where a burgeoning bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin (BTC) suggests that the current downtrend may be nearing its end. Santiment, a blockchain analytics platform, noted in a recent market insights report that prices tend to move inversely to the expectations of the majority of traders. According to their analysis, the market could potentially bottom out either just before or shortly after the upcoming halving, anticipated within the next two days. Santiment’s Social Trends indicator, which monitors discussions across platforms like Telegram, Reddit, and 4Chan, has revealed a decline in mentions related to “bull market” or “bull cycle” since late March. Conversely, there has been a steady increase in references to “bear market” or “bear cycle.” The decline in mentions of phrases like “buy the dip” indicates a waning sense of optimism, known in crypto circles as “hopium,” among retail investors. Historically, such a decline has often signaled the conclusion of downtrends. Bitcoin has faced various pressures this month, including diminishing prospects of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, escalating geopolitical tensions, and U.S. tax payment deadlines. These factors have contributed to a 14% decline in its price, with the leading cryptocurrency briefly dropping below $60,000 before rebounding to around $61,200 at the time of writing. With Bitcoin’s blockchain set to undergo its fourth mining reward halving, reducing the per-block BTC emission by 50% to 3.125 BTC, concerns about a further price decline have been raised by some analysts, including those at JPMorgan. However, the prevailing consensus remains bullish over the long term.

According to the bank’s analysis, retail investors were significant contributors to the recent sell-off in both crypto and equity assets during April. Moreover, spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced outflows, indicating a decline in retail interest. The bank identifies three main challenges persisting in the market: high positioning levels, elevated bitcoin prices compared to gold and production costs, and subdued crypto venture capital (VC) funding. The recent profit-taking in cryptocurrency markets has been notably driven by retail investors, overshadowing the involvement of institutional investors. Bitcoin, for instance, witnessed a 16% decline in April, marking its largest monthly drop since June 2022. In a notable development, U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs recorded their highest-ever net outflows on Wednesday, totaling $563.7 million across 11 ETFs. This significant withdrawal occurred despite these funds only commencing trading on January 11. JPMorgan’s analysis suggests that institutional investors, particularly momentum traders like commodity trading advisors (CTAs), have been capitalizing on previous extensive positions in bitcoin and gold. However, the reduction in positions by other institutional investors outside of quantitative funds and CTAs appears to be more limited, as indicated by futures market data. In summary, while retail investors have played a prominent role in the recent crypto market sell-off, institutional investors, particularly momentum traders, have also been active in adjusting their positions. JPMorgan’s cautious stance reflects the ongoing challenges and uncertainties prevailing in the cryptocurrency landscape.

Earlier this year, the software consulting firm rebranded itself as a “bitcoin development company,” emphasizing its commitment to advancing the Bitcoin network through various means such as financial markets, advocacy, and innovation. The unveiling of “MicroStrategy Orange” signifies the company’s dedication to realizing this objective. MicroStrategy Orange aims to offer decentralized identities that are “trustless, tamper-proof, and long-lived,” according to founder Michael Saylor. The service will enable users to issue decentralized identifiers (DIDs), ensuring pseudonymity similar to bitcoin transactions, which are not directly linked to real-world identities. Leveraging Bitcoin’s Ordinals Protocol, MicroStrategy Orange enables the storage and communication of information on individual satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin. MicroStrategy has already developed an application called “Orange For Outlook” using its decentralized identity service. This application integrates digital signatures into emails, allowing recipients to verify the identity of the sender securely. Currently, MicroStrategy holds a substantial amount of bitcoin, totaling 214,400 BTC, which amounts to approximately $10 billion. This constitutes more than 1% of the total bitcoin supply that will ever exist.

The halving event, which occurred recently, is expected to significantly increase costs for miners, with electricity and overall production expenses nearly doubling. To counter these rising costs, mining companies are exploring the potential of AI operations, leveraging energy-secure locations for potential higher returns. BitDigital (BTBT), Hive (HIVE), Hut 8 (HUT), TeraWulf (WULF), and Core Scientific (CORZ) are among the companies mentioned by CoinShares that are either already generating income from AI or have plans to do so. The report suggests a trend where Bitcoin mining operations may migrate to stranded energy sites while investment in AI expands in more stable locations. Pre-halving, the weighted average cash cost of production was approximately $29,500 per Bitcoin. Post-halving, this is projected to rise to about $53,000. Similarly, the average electricity cost of production per Bitcoin is expected to increase from around $16,300 to approximately $34,900. CoinShares forecasts a potential rise in hash rate to 700 exahash by 2025. However, immediately after the halving, a 10% drop in hashrate is anticipated as miners shut down unprofitable machines. Hash prices are also expected to decline post-halving to $53 per hash/day. Despite these challenges, miners are actively managing financial liabilities and using excess cash to pay down debt, indicating strategic financial planning amidst changing market dynamics.

Dogecoin Approaches ‘Golden Cross’: Sign of a Surge? Author Faith YakubuPosted on May 10, 2024Categories Investing NewsTags Crypto news, Crypto news today, Crypto stocks, Cryptocurrency, Cryptocurrency news, Cryptocurrency stocks, Dogecoin, Golden Cross, Stock market news today Dogecoin (DOGE), the leading meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing signs of entering another bullish phase reminiscent of its spectacular rise in early 2021. According to CoinDesk, Dogecoin’s market cap currently stands at approximately $22 billion, with a remarkable year-to-date price increase of over 70%, significantly outstripping Bitcoin’s (BTC) near 50% gain. A critical technical indicator, the ‘golden cross’, is nearing confirmation for Dogecoin. This occurs when the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-week SMA, signaling potential long-term upward momentum. Such crossovers are often used by momentum traders to pinpoint optimal market entry and exit points. Historically, Dogecoin experienced a golden cross in early January 2021, which preceded a four-month rally leading to an unprecedented 8,000% increase in its price, peaking at 76 cents on Binance. However, it’s crucial to approach such indicators with caution as past performance is not always indicative of future results, and moving average crossovers can sometimes lag behind actual market movements. Moreover, the dynamics around meme cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin differ significantly from more traditional investments. Lacking substantial real-world applications, their market movements are largely driven by speculative trading. This makes them particularly vulnerable to shifts in global financial conditions such as liquidity and interest rate changes. During Dogecoin’s 2021 rally, global interest rates were at or near zero, fostering an environment ripe for high-risk investments. Currently, however, with U.S. interest rates exceeding 5%, the economic backdrop is considerably different, potentially influencing the trajectory of speculative assets like Dogecoin. Investors should remain vigilant, considering both the technical setup and broader economic factors when evaluating the potential for another major rally in Dogecoin’s price.

Gas fees currently range between 5 and 10 gwei, marking one of the lowest levels observed this year. The Ethereum network experiences a notable decrease in the daily volume of ETH burned, reaching its lowest point this year, largely influenced by a recent decline in average gas fees. Presently, gas fees fluctuate between 5 and 10 gwei, representing one of the lowest levels recorded year-to-date and impacting ETH issuance. The reduction in network fees translates to a decrease in ETH burned. On Sunday, only 610 ETH were burned, marking a record low for the year, while Ethereum’s gas fees remained minimal. In contrast, the daily volume of ETH burned during the first four months of this year consistently exceeded 2,500–3,000 ETH. The ongoing decline in gas fees is attributed partly to a shift in activity towards Layer 2 scaling solutions and the increasing adoption of blob transactions introduced with the Dencun upgrade in March, which helps alleviate transaction costs on Layer 2s. The dynamics of gas fees and ETH burning are closely monitored aspects of the network’s economic model. While low fees benefit network users, the recent decrease in ETH burn impacts Ethereum’s deflationary characteristics. The London hard fork, also known as EIP-1559, implemented in August 2021, fundamentally altered Ethereum’s fee structure. The upgrade introduced a base fee that is burned and a priority fee acting as a tip to validators. As the base fee correlates with network usage, higher fees result in a greater amount of ETH being removed from circulation through burning. In the past week, Ethereum’s supply has turned inflationary, with a growth rate of 0.49%, contrasting its previous deflationary trend, as reported by ultrasound.money. If activity surges and more ETH is burned than issued, Ethereum will return to a deflationary state.

On Monday, spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively experienced net inflows exceeding $62 million, with FBTC securing the largest single-day net inflow of $34.83 million. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and The iShares Bitcoin Trust also saw substantial net inflows of over $22.5 million and $19.65 million, respectively. In contrast, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust witnessed the largest single-day net outflow, with nearly $35 million exiting the product. However, since their inception, U.S.-traded spot bitcoin ETFs have amassed a cumulative total net inflow of $12.38 billion, indicating continued investor interest. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, known for its consistent inflows, extended its streak for the 70th consecutive day on Monday, solidifying its position among the top 10 ETFs with the longest streaks of daily inflows. IBIT currently commands a market share of nearly 54% among spot bitcoin ETFs. Despite recent fluctuations, the price of Bitcoin remains resilient, hovering above $66,200 as reported by The Block’s Bitcoin Price Page. This stability in bitcoin’s price underscores ongoing investor confidence in the digital asset and its associated investment vehicles.

Short-covering activity has been notably active, contributing to this upward trend. Despite recent corrections, Bitcoin continues to assert its dominance within the cryptocurrency market, attracting investors who are turning away from riskier currencies. Additionally, a slowdown in US 10-year treasury yields has provided further support and bolstered sentiment towards cryptocurrencies. Today, Bitcoin saw a notable rally of 2.9% on Bitstamp, reaching $63,046 from a session low of $60,830. This recovery comes after a 4% decline on Wednesday, the second drop in three days, when it dipped to $59,672 amidst turbulence in Wall Street markets. The collective market value of cryptocurrencies surged by $20 billion today, surpassing $2.375 trillion, buoyed by gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin’s dominance has strengthened as other AI-linked cryptocurrencies experienced declines in recent weeks. Its market share has risen to 55%, marking an increase of 1.35% last week and 2.5% in March, largely due to an influx of new investments. Anticipation surrounding Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event has driven Google searches to record highs, surpassing the interest levels seen during the 2020 halving. Meanwhile, US 10-year treasury yields have receded from their recent five-month highs, falling to 4.696%. This decline has provided support for non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. As the market awaits further guidance on US interest rates, Crypto.com‘s CEO anticipates a wave of selling leading up to the halving event. However, in the long run, this event is expected to have a positive impact and add value to the cryptocurrency market.

Despite this setback, some investors maintain optimism for long-term gains, pointing to the possibility of a bullish trend triggered by Bitcoin Halving. However, ETH faces resistance even as it finds support at $2,850, with conflicting signals from technical indicators adding to market uncertainty. Ethereum, the leading altcoin by market capitalization, has not escaped the recent market downturn, witnessing a 2.50% decline in price. Worries about a potential descent to $3,000 have emerged following this setback and amid broader concerns of a significant market correction. Nevertheless, despite the current downturn, certain investors remain hopeful about Ethereum’s long-term trajectory. The historical precedent of Bitcoin Halving sparking an altcoin season hints at the potential for a future uptrend. With a market capitalization of $382 billion, Ethereum has experienced an 18% drop over recent weeks. However, the ETH price has found support around the 50% Fibonacci level, approximately $2,850. The consolidation on the weekly chart between the 50% and 61.80% Fibonacci levels has been prolonged by the latest downturn. The smaller rejection from the 50% Fib level suggests a possible bullish breakout, potentially leading to sustained levels above $3,000. Can Ethereum Regain Momentum? At its current trading price of $3,140, Ethereum displays an intraday Doji candle, highlighting the altcoin’s volatile nature. The resumption of an upward trend for Ethereum may occur if the market manages to avoid further losses. Technical indicators offer a mixed outlook for Ethereum. The bearish crossover in the MACD and signal lines on the weekly chart reflects the recent pullback phase. However, a rebound from the 50% Fib level in ETH price could reignite positive momentum. A potential breakout above the $3,265 resistance level may signal an entry opportunity for a bull run continuation. Such a scenario could test the formidable $4,000 resistance level, potentially resulting in a 25% increase. However, while the likelihood of a drop to $3,000 remains minimal, it still concerns investors amidst the current market conditions. The prevailing uncertainty prompts investors to carefully evaluate the potential outcomes for Ethereum’s price movement.

According to IntoTheBlock, large holders, known as whales, increased their BTC holdings by 19,760 coins, valued at over $1.2 billion, at an average price of $62,500 on Friday. Whales, influential players in the crypto market, are closely watched for their buying and selling patterns, often signaling market movements. Their accumulation during dips historically precedes price surges, suggesting a bullish sentiment. This surge in whale activity contrasts with earlier in the week when investors hesitated to capitalize on market weakness. The subsequent rebound past $65,000, following airstrikes in Iran, was partly attributed to spot BTC buyers. Bitcoin’s consolidation around $60,000 comes ahead of its halving event on April 20, reducing miner rewards and curbing token issuance. Despite uncertainties, opportunistic buying between $60,000-$62,000 levels indicates underlying market support. David Han from Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN)Institutional notes the dual role of Bitcoin as both a risk asset and a safe haven, contributing to directional uncertainty amid market fluctuations.

The halving, a fundamental shift in Bitcoin’s technology that reduces the rate of new bitcoin creation, occurred over the weekend. While some enthusiasts anticipated a price surge similar to past halving events, the market response has been muted. As of Monday afternoon GMT, Bitcoin traded at $66,300, showing modest gains amidst a landscape dominated by geopolitical uncertainties. Mick Roche, a senior trader at Zodia Markets, noted that events like easing tensions between Iran and Israel have exerted more influence on Bitcoin’s price than the halving itself. Eric Demuth, CEO of Bitpanda, emphasized Bitcoin’s increasing correlation with broader market sentiment, suggesting that retail trading patterns around the halving were not distinctive. Bitcoin’s resilience is partly attributed to its evolving relationship with traditional markets. Regulatory developments, such as the potential approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., have bolstered investor confidence and contributed to its recovery from previous downturns. Looking ahead, Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro, highlighted the trend towards institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While retail investors currently dominate the market, regulatory changes could pave the way for broader institutional involvement. Despite its growing prominence, cryptocurrencies remain a niche asset class, with regulatory scrutiny and limited real-world utility tempering their mainstream appeal. Market observers are also awaiting regulatory decisions on spot ETFs for Ethereum, though hopes for imminent approval are diminishing.

Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., and Drew Ferguson, R-Ga., have introduced the Providing Tax Clarity for Digital Assets Act. The bill aims to clarify that staking rewards should only be taxed at the time of their sale to prevent double taxation. Rep. Ferguson emphasized the need for clarity in the treatment of digital asset rewards, citing confusion among investors and businesses, as well as the risk of American businesses relocating overseas due to tax complexities. He highlighted that the bill would provide much-needed clarity, establish US leadership in digital asset tax treatment, and foster innovation and business within the country. The bill comes in response to a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service last year, which stated that crypto investors earning rewards from staking services must include the value of those rewards in their gross income. According to Coin Center, the bill proposes that taxes on block rewards from proof-of-work or proof-of-stake networks should only be applied when they are spent or sold, rather than when they are acquired. This approach aims to resolve major issues with current cryptocurrency taxation and ensure fair treatment of the technology. The Proof of Stake Alliance echoed similar sentiments, describing the bill as a “common-sense clarification of existing law” that promotes tax fairness and compliance. The alliance emphasized that the bill would prevent double taxation by taxing block rewards only at the time of their sale or exchange. Rep. Nickel, a supporter of crypto, has previously advocated for digital asset legislation and pushed for the advancement of the Financial Innovation and Technology Act. Both Rep. Nickel and Rep. Ferguson have announced their retirement and will not seek reelection.

The digital asset experienced a temporary drop of over 6% to $59,643 on Friday but later stabilized, reaching $64,640 by 10:55 a.m. in New York. Other tokens like Ether, Solana, and the meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin also regained stability. Israel’s retaliatory strike on Iran, occurring less than a week after Tehran’s rocket and drone attacks, caused ripples across global markets. Reports indicating the safety of nuclear facilities in Isfahan, Iran, helped alleviate some concerns. Traditional safe-haven assets such as bonds, gold, and the dollar saw reduced gains, while stocks recovered from session lows. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East is overshadowing the anticipated Bitcoin halving scheduled for later on Friday, which will reduce the token’s new supply. Historically, halvings have driven up the price of Bitcoin. However, with Bitcoin reaching a record high in mid-March before the event, there are doubts about whether the expected impact is already factored into the market. Stefan von Haenisch, head of trading at OSL SG Pte, suggested that continued violence between Israel and Iran could prompt a general risk-off sentiment across the crypto market. Nonetheless, he noted that it might require a substantial downward movement to reverse the bullish sentiment surrounding the halving. Strategists from JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co. and Deutsche Bank AG have indicated that the quadrennial halving is already largely priced in by investors. Ahead of the event, a series of three-month-old spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have recorded five consecutive days of net outflows.

Plaintiffs allege that Binance has run afoul of local securities regulations. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice has initiated a certification motion for a class-action lawsuit against Binance. The core accusation revolves around the sale of crypto derivative products to retail investors without proper registration, according to the plaintiffs. The lawsuit is seeking damages and the rescission of illicit derivative trades. Plaintiffs argue that tens of thousands of Canadian users engaged in Binance’s cryptocurrency derivatives offerings through its platform. Further complicating matters, the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has directed both Google and Apple to remove the Binance app from their respective app stores for users in the Philippines. Emilio Aquino, chair of the SEC, emphasized that selling or offering unregistered securities to locals and operating as an unregistered broker breaches the country’s securities regulations. Removing Binance’s applications from digital app marketplaces, according to Aquino, is crucial to curb the proliferation of its illicit activities in the Philippines, which could otherwise have detrimental effects on the local economy. Meanwhile, in the United States, prosecutors have recommended a 36-month prison sentence for Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. This recommendation comes after Zhao pleaded guilty to charges related to money laundering. In their filing to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, prosecutors underscored the gravity of Zhao’s deliberate violation of U.S. law and its repercussions. They argue that the proposed 36-month sentence, coupled with a $50 million fine, strikes an appropriate balance in addressing the pertinent legal factors and achieving the objectives of sentencing.

Grayscale’s GBTC witnessed $130.42 million exiting the converted bitcoin ETF, while Fidelity and Ark Invest’s funds were the sole recipients of inflows, totaling approximately $10 million. Among the eight funds with zero flows were BlackRock’s IBIT and Bitwise’s BITB, with IBIT ending its 71-day positive streak on Wednesday. According to Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, days with zero inflows are typical and do not necessarily indicate product failure. She suggests that such occurrences often align with market performance and geopolitical tensions, underscoring the complexities beyond ETF flows. Joe Caselin, head of institutional marketing at BIT crypto exchange, echoes this sentiment, stating that zero flows in an ETF are not unusual but may signify a cooling down of ETF excitement. He emphasizes the gradual integration of fiat into the Bitcoin narrative, anticipating fresh inflows to occur intermittently as traditional finance gradually merges with crypto. Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart previously explained that ETF shares are created or destroyed in units, a process triggered by significant disparities in supply and demand. This phenomenon explains why zero flows are commonly observed in such products. The Block ETF data dashboard reports that the cumulative trading volume for all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs is approaching $230 billion.

This notable increase in transactions indicates a growing interest in using Bitcoin for everyday transactions, expanding its conventional role beyond being merely a store of value. Bitcoin Runes Lead Daily Transactions According to Blockchain.com data, the launch of Bitcoin Runes, an alternative to Bitcoin Ordinals, directly correlates with the surge in daily Bitcoin payments. On April 23, Runes accounted for 68% of all Bitcoin transactions, showcasing rapid adoption within the community. By April 29, BTC had reclaimed its dominance, representing 77.8% of Bitcoin transactions, while Runes maintained a strong second position with an 18.8% share. Other protocols, including Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, also contributed to the network activity. Impact on Miners and Market Opportunities The ascent of Bitcoin Runes has resulted in over 1,200 BTC in transaction fees for miners since the Bitcoin halving event, offering a substantial incentive for miners and highlighting the economic feasibility of this emerging protocol. However, some experts caution against excessive optimism. On April 17, pseudonymous DeFi researcher Ignas, cautioned on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that while Runes appear promising, they could face a similar fate to NFTs. The Rise of Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) BRC-20 and Runes tokens symbolize the emergence of a new standard known as Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi). These fungible token standards aim to enhance Bitcoin’s utility beyond its existing capabilities, paving the way for DeFi applications built on the Bitcoin blockchain. This evolution is poised to unlock fresh opportunities for Bitcoin holders and stimulate the growth of the BTCFi ecosystem. As developers delve into BTCFi’s potential, investors can anticipate further innovation and diversification in Bitcoin payments and applications.

Ontario’s Superior Court of Justice published a certification motion for the lawsuit on April 19, reigniting legal scrutiny against the exchange. The lawsuit accuses Binance of selling cryptocurrency derivative products to retail investors without proper registration, in violation of Ontario Securities Act (OSA) and federal laws. Plaintiffs represented by Christopher Lochan and Jeremy Leeder seek damages and recissions of unlawful derivative trades for Canadian Binance users, numbering in the tens of thousands. This legal action comes after Binance announced plans to cease operations in Ontario in response to regulatory warnings from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) in 2023. Despite this announcement, the OSC’s investigation into Binance remains ongoing, highlighting continued regulatory scrutiny. The lawsuit further tarnishes Binance’s reputation, already marred by previous controversies, including former CEO Changpeng Zhao’s guilty plea to US anti-money laundering violations in 2021. Although current CEO Richard Teng has made efforts to steer Binance towards regulatory compliance, including securing a Dubai crypto license, the exchange’s past regulatory issues continue to overshadow its progress.

One of the primary avenues to participate in EigenLayer involves contributing to the security of Ethereum and amplifying interest in staking activities. Staking on Ethereum has gained considerable momentum, particularly with the surge in popularity of restaking methods, as discussed in recent discussions. In a noteworthy update, EigenLayer made its debut on the Ethereum mainnet, introducing its EigenDA data availability layer. Notable operators such as Coinbase Cloud and Google Cloud have joined as the protocol’s initial participants. Additionally, EigenLayer revealed six actively validated services that would benefit from its restaking mechanism, reinforcing its position in the ecosystem. This launch enables restakers on the platform to earn an additional yield on their staked ETH, a feature previously unavailable. Many users had initially deposited ETH into the protocol in anticipation of higher yields and speculated on potential airdrops as EigenLayer allocated restaking points. Accessing EigenLayer necessitates staking ETH, either by setting up a validator or utilizing a liquid staking protocol to acquire staking derivative tokens. Liquid staking tokens (LST) offer holders liquidity and can be obtained by depositing into designated protocols or through direct purchase. The surge in new validators underscores the increasing interest in contributing to Ethereum’s security through EigenLayer. Notably, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with The Merge in September 2022, allowing individuals to operate validators on the Beaconchain alongside the mainnet. Staking gained substantial traction following the Shapella upgrade in April 2023, which introduced the ability to withdraw staked ETH, enhancing user confidence in the security of their funds. At its peak in June 2023, the validator queue reached 96,000, prompting measures to maintain network stability. However, the queue gradually subsided, remaining below 10,000 from October 2023 to March of the following year. The resurgence of interest in restaking has propelled the validator entry queue to 20,000, reflecting robust demand to fortify the Ethereum network.

Originally initiated by Telegram, the TON network has experienced rapid expansion, fueled by incentives to onboard Telegram users. Tether, the entity behind the $108 billion market cap USDT, disclosed plans to integrate the dollar-pegged stablecoin and its gold-backed counterpart XAUT natively on The Open Network (TON), a blockchain closely associated with the messaging app Telegram. Tether’s transparency page revealed that $10 million worth of USDT has been authorized on the TON blockchain, with $3 million already issued. This strategic move aims to facilitate “borderless, peer-to-peer payments” among Telegram’s extensive user base and bolster the burgeoning TON ecosystem, enabling users to leverage the stablecoins in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, emphasized the significance of this expansion, stating that the launch of USDT and XAUT on TON would enable seamless value transfer. This move aims to increase activity and liquidity while offering users a financial experience akin to those found in the traditional financial system. The Open Network operates as a decentralized layer-1 network initially spearheaded by Telegram but operating independently due to regulatory concerns. Recent months have witnessed a surge in TON’s ecosystem, propelled by incentives for Telegram user adoption, with monthly active addresses surpassing 1.7 million from less than 100,000 six months ago. Despite a momentary dip of up to 15% in the TON token following the announcement, it remains up 7% over the past 24 hours and has tripled in price this year, amassing a market capitalization of nearly $25 billion. Telegram’s crypto wallet supports various blockchains for deposits and withdrawals, with trading fees substantially reduced to encourage TON adoption. Ramp Network, a fintech firm bridging crypto with traditional banking infrastructure, announced plans to facilitate purchases and withdrawals of USDT on TON following the announcement. Starting with fiat-to-USDT on TON on its platform, Ramp Network intends to integrate with third-party wallets supporting TON-based assets and later incorporate off-ramp capabilities. Szymon Sypniewicz, CEO of Ramp Network, articulated the company’s vision, stating, “Crypto transactions should be as simple as texting,” underscoring the potential to enhance the lives of millions within the TON ecosystem through accessible, low-cost crypto transactions.

Upon my departure, my former employer sent a cease-and-desist letter alleging a breach of a non-compete clause in my employment contract. Despite the weak legal grounds of their claim, I found myself entangled in a lengthy dispute, facing financial losses, emotional strain, and months of unemployment. My story is not unique. Nearly one in five Americans is bound by non-compete agreements, leading to unnecessary hurdles for both employees and employers. The FTC’s move to ban non-compete agreements is a significant step forward, with Chair Lina M. Khan estimating it could spur the creation of 8,500 new startups through increased competition. As someone working in the blockchain and digital assets sector, I see this decision as aligning with the open-source ethos fundamental to our industry’s innovation. It’s ironic that a blockchain startup, built on principles of decentralization and collaboration, would resort to enforcing restrictive non-compete clauses. Furthermore, the contrast between my experience and California’s long-standing ban on non-competes highlights the potential impact of such regulations on fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. The FTC’s action signals a positive shift, not only for individual employees like myself but also for the broader crypto industry, where talent mobility and innovation thrive in an environment free from unnecessary constraints.

However, historical trends reveal a rather subdued landscape in this niche subsector. Tether’s XAUT and Paxos’ PAXG stand as the major players in the gold stablecoin market. Yet, compared to their dollar stablecoin counterparts, USDT and USDP, their market presence appears minimal. XAUT boasts a market cap of $580 million, while PAXG trails behind at just under $450 million. XAUT’s supply has remained steady at around 246,500 units since March 2022, contrasting with PAXG’s declining supply from its peak of around 340,000 units in August 2022 to just 182,650 units presently. Although trading volumes on centralized exchanges for these gold stablecoins have shown some increase, it’s important to note that the rise may be partly attributed to the escalating value of gold. The 7-day moving average of trading volumes for both stablecoins reached relative peaks in mid-March but has since declined, despite the continued climb of gold prices. These peaks pale in comparison to previous highs, such as during the 2023 regional banking crisis. While volumes have slowly risen since hitting a low in May, recent events have seen a slight uptick. PAXG experienced a significant jump in volume to $71 million on April 13, the highest level since May 2022, following reports of Iranian drone attacks on Israel. Similarly, XAUT volumes increased, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite these developments, $71 million in trading volume remains relatively low for a crypto asset. In contrast, larger dollar-pegged stablecoins often transact billions of dollars a day on-chain alone. On centralized exchanges (CEXs), dollar stablecoin volumes are notably higher, given their widespread use as a primary quote asset. In conclusion, the gold-backed stablecoin market remains a niche subsector, despite the recent surge in gold’s popularity within the broader market.

The Bitcoin network’s seven-day rolling average hash rate, which measures the computing power used to mine Bitcoin, showed a sharp decline from an all-time high of approximately 650 exahashes per second (EH/s) on April 19 to 586 EH/s by May 11. The halving event, which occurred on April 19, cut the reward for mining a block of Bitcoin from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively slashing the miners’ revenue by nearly half. This reduction has forced miners to adopt cost-cutting measures such as optimizing energy expenditures, enhancing mining efficiency, and securing better terms for hardware procurement. Despite these challenges, CoinShares’ analysis based on Q4 2023 figures suggests that publicly listed Bitcoin mining firms, like Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) and Riot Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT), are still profitable, with the average production cost per Bitcoin estimated at $53,000, while Bitcoin traded at $63,000 on Monday. However, profitability has diminished compared to pre-halving levels. Additionally, new Bitcoin applications such as Ordinals and Runes have increased on-chain activity and network transaction fees, offering another revenue stream for miners. According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, transaction fees now constitute 7% of miner revenue, a significant increase from 1% two years ago. This change reflects the evolving landscape and adaptation strategies within the Bitcoin mining industry.

Here’s a breakdown of what awaits: What is Bitcoin Halving and Why Is it Significant? Bitcoin “halving,” occurring approximately every four years, directly affects bitcoin production. Miners, utilizing specialized computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, receive a fixed number of bitcoins as a reward upon completion. As the name suggests, halving cuts this fixed income in half, thereby reducing the influx of new bitcoins into the market. Consequently, the supply of available coins grows more gradually, aligning with bitcoin’s fundamental characteristic of limited supply. With only 21 million bitcoins ever to exist and the majority already mined, scarcity becomes a defining feature. The reduction in supply can potentially drive up bitcoin prices, assuming demand remains steady or increases relative to supply. However, predicting future price movements remains uncertain, as past performance does not guarantee future results. How Frequently Does Halving Occur? According to Bitcoin’s code, halving takes place after the creation of every 210,000 “blocks” during the mining process, roughly translating to a four-year interval. The next halving is anticipated to unfold imminently. Will Halving Impact Bitcoin’s Price? The impact on bitcoin’s price remains speculative. Historically, following previous halvings, bitcoin’s price experienced mixed short-term reactions, eventually surging significantly one year later. Nonetheless, market conditions beyond halving contribute to these fluctuations. The current halving arrives on the heels of a bullish year for bitcoin, with prices doubling compared to the previous year. Factors such as the introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs and persistent demand may further influence bitcoin’s trajectory. What About Miners? Miners face the challenge of adapting to reduced rewards while managing operational costs. Efficiently prepared miners may weather the transition better, but struggling firms might encounter difficulties. Consolidation within the mining industry is probable, a trend exacerbated by previous market downturns. Larger miners may expand operations, leveraging technological advancements for efficiency gains. What About the Environment? Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact stems largely from energy consumption. While recent trends indicate a shift towards cleaner energy sources, concerns persist regarding reliance on pollutive energy. The looming halving might incentivize miners to seek cheaper, albeit less environmentally friendly, energy sources. Additionally, some firms may explore low-cost energy regions, potentially deploying inefficient mining rigs. In essence, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving carries implications for its economy, environment, and industry landscape, yet its exact outcomes remain uncertain amidst the dynamic cryptoverse.

It represents a fundamental evolution in the management and transaction of assets on a global scale. The distinction between crypto-native tokens and tokenized real-world assets is paramount. While crypto-native tokens like bitcoin and ether exist purely in the digital realm and serve various purposes within their ecosystems, tokenized RWAs bridge the gap between digital and traditional finance. They enhance liquidity and fractionalization, making previously illiquid assets more accessible. The recent launch of BlackRock’s BUIDL, a tokenized private short-term treasury fund, is a significant milestone in the realm of tokenization. BUIDL attracted nearly $300 million in assets within its first month, signaling BlackRock’s endorsement of tokenization as the future of markets. Tokenized government treasuries, exemplified by products like BENJI and USDY, have seen exponential growth, with the market surpassing $1.2 billion. Currently, on-chain RWAs represent a $7.5 billion market, but the pace of growth and the widening array of tokenized assets, including treasuries, commodities, real estate, and more, suggest a tipping point. Forecasts indicate that the market for tokenized assets could reach $16 trillion by 2030, facilitating the development of new financial ecosystems across DeFi protocols. A new demographic of investors has emerged within the crypto-native space, accustomed to accessing financial products and services directly from their wallets. These investors have benefited from a decentralized ecosystem operating 24/7, with lower barriers to entry compared to traditional financial systems. Geopolitical events can have a significant impact on tokenized assets, as demonstrated by the trading behavior of PAXG during heightened tensions between Iran and Israel. This underscores the importance of asset safety, a principle that applies to both traditional and digital markets. The concept of “Bring Your Own Wallet” represents a paradigm shift, empowering individual investors to manage and access their assets without relying on intermediaries.

Notably, this decline aligns with CertiK’s findings, indicating that crypto-related exploits and scams reached a historic low of $25.7 million in April. April’s Phishing Attack Insights According to Scam Sniffer’s analysis, the Coinbase-backed Ethereum layer-2 network Base experienced a notable surge of 145% to $8.2 million in phishing incidents during the past month. Interestingly, two of the top 10 largest single thefts occurred on this chain, constituting 21% of the month’s total theft. ERC-20 tokens faced the brunt of these attacks, with a staggering 88% of the stolen assets belonging to this class. Tools and Tactics Employed by Attackers Scam Sniffer has pinpointed fake accounts on the social media platform X (previously known as Twitter) as the primary tool utilized by scammers. These attackers impersonated prominent projects like Renzo, Avail, Ether.fi, Wormhole, and Omni. These fake accounts often displayed counterfeit verification marks, giving them an appearance of authenticity that was exploited to lure unsuspecting users. Using these fake accounts, the attackers posted deceptive comments on social media platforms to redirect unsuspecting individuals to malicious sites where their assets could be stolen. Additionally, the attackers frequently utilized phishing signatures such as Permit, IncreaseAllowance, and Uniswap Permit2. These malicious signatures enabled the attackers to access their victim’s funds without their knowledge. Scam Sniffer further added that despite wallets increasing phishing alerts for certain signatures, wallet drainers are actively finding ways to circumvent these alerts by using legitimate contracts like Disperse and Uniswap Multicall, along with variants of value normalization.

The move aims to enhance Tether’s ability to identify and address potential risks associated with illicit activities such as terrorist financing and sanctions evasion. The monitoring system, which includes capabilities for international sanctions compliance and detection of illicit transfers, will enable Tether to identify crypto wallets that may pose risks or be linked to illicit and/or sanctioned addresses. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino emphasized the significance of this collaboration in promoting transparency and security within the cryptocurrency industry. This partnership comes amidst growing regulatory pressure on Tether globally, with concerns raised about USDT’s purported role in circumventing international sanctions and facilitating illicit finance. Reports have surfaced of Venezuela’s state-run oil company using USDT to bypass U.S. sanctions, while a United Nations report highlighted the stablecoin’s involvement in underground banking and money laundering in East Asia and Southeast Asia. USDT, with a circulating supply exceeding $110 billion, maintains a peg to the US dollar and is primarily backed by U.S. Treasury bonds held in reserve, managed by Cantor Fitzgerald. Tether recently reported first-quarter earnings of $4.52 billion, underscoring its prominence in the cryptocurrency market despite regulatory challenges.

Of these liquidations, approximately $154 million were from long positions. Bitcoin’s liquidations soared to over $108 million as the asset dipped below the $60,000 mark before rebounding. Presently, it struggles to maintain its position above $64,000. Coinglass data reveals that liquidations were almost evenly split between bitcoin longs and shorts, totaling just over $54 million and $53 million, respectively. The largest digital asset by market capitalization increased by around 5.3% in the past 24 hours, trading at $64,739 at 5:22 a.m. ET, according to The Block’s Price Page. The GM 30 Index, representing a selection of the top 30 cryptocurrencies, rose by 4.46% to 129.97 in the same period. According to The Block’s halving countdown, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event, where the miners’ block subsidy reward gets halved, is less than 100 blocks away. Analysts from 21Shares suggested that Bitcoin may continue in a lateral movement until geopolitical concerns, such as conflicts in the Middle East and control of oil transportation routes, stabilize. The analysts observed that if geopolitical risks stabilize, bitcoin is expected to continue its upward trend post-halving. This is anticipated to be supported by increasing institutional interest in digital assets, particularly driven by U.S. spots and recently approved Hong Kong ETFs. Coinbase analyst David Han emphasized the impact of macroeconomic factors, particularly heightened geopolitical tensions, on short-term crypto activity. “The recent elevated correlation of altcoins against bitcoin underlines this, indicating bitcoin’s anchor role in the space even as it firms its position as a macro asset,” Han stated in this week’s Coinbase Monthly Outlook report.

Historically, periods of bearish sentiment in the crypto community have often coincided with market bottoms, reflecting a sentiment that aligns with American poet and novelist Charles Bukowski famously asserted that the masses are consistently mistaken, and true wisdom lies in taking actions divergent from the crowd. This principle applies to Bitcoin as well, as the current prevalence of bearish sentiment suggests the possibility of a reversal in the ongoing sell-off of BTC prices. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment noted a decrease in mentions of “bull market” or “bull cycle” on crypto social media platforms since late March, coupled with a consistent rise in references to “bear market” or “bear cycle.” This shift in sentiment may indicate a possible reversal in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Santiment’s Social Trends indicator, which monitors discussions across platforms like Telegram, Reddit, and 4Chan, has observed a decrease in “buy the dip” mentions, indicating waning hopes among retail investors for a quick recovery and continued bull run. Factors such as diminishing expectations of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, heightened geopolitical tensions, and the timing of U.S. tax payments have contributed to bitcoin’s recent price decline, which saw a 14% slide this month. Despite these challenges, bitcoin’s blockchain is set to undergo its fourth mining reward halving, reducing the per-block BTC emission by 50% to 3.125 BTC. While some analysts, including JPMorgan, have warned of a potential further decline in prices following the event, the overall consensus remains bullish for Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

This significant decline in the activity of the Rune etchings, which are part of a fungible token protocol, has dramatically decreased transaction fee income for Bitcoin miners. On April 26, the network recorded a peak of 23,061 Rune etchings, but the recent slump has resulted in transaction fees from these etchings dropping to a mere US$3,835 on Monday. Despite this downturn, Rune transactions have remained a dominant force in Bitcoin network activity to date, with over 91,200 Runes etched on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Runes protocol was launched on April 20, initially providing a substantial boost to miners’ earnings by generating significant transaction fees. This was particularly beneficial following the fourth Bitcoin halving event, which reduced the block subsidy to 3.125 BTC but was offset by increased transaction volumes from Rune etchings. Developed by Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor, the Runes protocol aims to efficiently utilize block space for creating fungible tokens, adhering to Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, offering a more streamlined approach compared to BRC-20s. However, some Bitcoin core developers have expressed concerns, criticizing the Runes protocol for potentially exploiting vulnerabilities within the Bitcoin network.

The decision comes as part of a larger plan to expand its workspace, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke to The Block. The Commercial Observer recently reported on Coinbase’s new rental agreement, which entails an eleven-year lease for a 67,208-square-foot space at One Madison. This marks a significant upgrade from its previous office at 55 Hudson Yards, which the company has leased since 2021. While Coinbase has not publicly commented on the reason for the relocation, sources indicate that the new office space is approximately twice the size of its Hudson Yards location. However, there are no immediate plans to change the company’s remote-work policy or increase its New York-based team size. Coinbase’s headcount has remained relatively stable this year, with 3,416 employees as of the end of 2023. It remains uncertain whether Coinbase will terminate its existing lease at Hudson Yards or wait for it to expire. Although specific rental costs for One Madison were not disclosed by Coinbase, recent deals in the building suggest premium rates. In comparison, the average asking rents at Hudson Yards are slightly lower, reflecting the competitive real estate landscape in Manhattan. Coinbase’s move coincides with favorable market conditions for tenants, as Manhattan landlords are offering concessions to address high office vacancy rates. Despite regulatory challenges in the past, Coinbase’s financial performance has improved, with the company posting profits in the first quarter of 2024 amid a surge in cryptocurrency prices. This relocation is part of Coinbase’s broader strategy, as the company continues to expand its footprint. In addition to the New York office move, Coinbase also secured a 40,000-square-foot space in California’s Bay Area last summer.

Despite the rollercoaster ride of cryptocurrency prices, the company’s revenues in 2023 and 2022 amounted to $689 million and $647 million, respectively, showcasing resilience to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. Bitcoin Depot’s success amid market turbulence is attributed to its strategic approach to services primarily used for non-speculative purposes, such as money transfers, international remittances, and online purchases. The company’s user surveys indicate a preference for practical utility over speculative trading. Unlike entities heavily involved in cryptocurrency trading or mining, Bitcoin Depot maintains a relatively low balance of Bitcoin, typically less than $1 million, at any given time, minimizing exposure to volatility. The company’s proactive measures include purchasing Bitcoin through reputable liquidity providers rather than engaging in mining activities. This approach, coupled with a sophisticated Bitcoin management process, effectively mitigates exposure to price volatility and differentiates Bitcoin Depot from competitors. Bitcoin Depot’s operational model does not act as an agent or exchange for users in transactions but maintains Bitcoin balances to fulfill user demand from kiosk or BDCheckout transactions. Cash in Bitcoin ATM kiosks represents approximately 21% of the company’s average monthly revenues, highlighting a dual approach to managing Bitcoin and cash balances that contributes to stability and resilience. Despite a decline in installations witnessed in the Bitcoin ATM market in 2023, Bitcoin Depot remains a dominant player, operating over 7,000 BTMs globally. Its competitors, CoinFlip and BitStop, operate 4,800 and 2,500 machines, respectively. While the overall trend saw a decrease in installed Bitcoin ATMs globally, Bitcoin Depot’s CEO, Brandon Mintz, remains optimistic about the industry’s future, anticipating a rebound following the anticipated Bitcoin halving event. This event, often associated with increased market activity and interest in cryptocurrencies, could further bolster Bitcoin Depot’s position in the market.

The platform’s prospective return hinges on its registration with the finance ministry’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), responsible for overseeing virtual asset commerce. Binance intends to comply with relevant legislation, including the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the crypto taxation framework, after previously neglecting these regulations, according to a source cited by the outlet. While physical presence in India is not mandatory, all virtual asset service providers (VASPs) are subject to Indian regulations, as clarified by the Ministry of Finance. This includes compliance with reporting, record-keeping, and other obligations outlined in the PMLA. India has been actively integrating the crypto sector into its financial system, introducing regulations last March mandating Know Your Customer (KYC) data collection from crypto companies. Additionally, VASPs with Indian operations, regardless of their location, must register as reporting entities with the FIU and adhere to the PMLA. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has advocated for global regulations governing cryptocurrencies, underscoring India’s commitment to regulatory clarity in the crypto space. Before its ban, Binance reportedly held a dominant market share in India, accounting for nearly 90% of the estimated $4 billion in cryptocurrency holdings among Indian citizens. Its popularity was attributed to its non-compliance with Indian tax regulations, as it facilitated trading without the 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) levied by registered exchanges. The introduction of the TDS prompted a significant migration of users to offshore crypto exchanges, including Binance.

After plummeting over 6% to $59,643 earlier on Friday, the digital asset stabilized around $64,450 as of 8:53 a.m. in London. Other cryptocurrencies like Ether, Solana, and Dogecoin also found stability. Israel’s retaliatory strike on Iran, following Tehran’s recent rocket and drone attacks, rattled global markets. However, reports reassuring the safety of nuclear facilities in Isfahan helped alleviate some concerns. Traditional safe-haven assets like bonds, gold, and the dollar pared gains, while stocks and US equity futures recovered from session lows. Amidst the Middle East conflict, the spotlight remains on Bitcoin’s halving event scheduled for later on Friday, which will reduce new token supply. Historically, halvings have driven up the price of Bitcoin. However, this time, Bitcoin hit a record high in mid-March prior to the event, raising questions about whether its potential impact has already been factored into the market. Stefan von Haenisch, head of trading at OSL SG Pte, noted that ongoing Israel-Iran violence could create a “general risk-off sentiment across crypto.” Nonetheless, he believes it would require a “significant move lower” to reverse the bullish sentiment surrounding the halving. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co. and Deutsche Bank AG have suggested that the quadrennial halving is already largely priced in by investors. Ahead of the event, a group of three-month-old spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have witnessed five consecutive days of net outflows.

TradeStation Crypto, based in Florida, has obtained money transmitter and other regulatory licenses across most U.S. states in recent years. Kraken’s acquisition of TradeStation Crypto marks a strategic step to accelerate its growth and introduce new product offerings in the U.S. market. A spokesperson for Kraken confirmed the acquisition, stating that it aligns with the company’s objectives to enhance its footprint in the U.S. market. However, the spokesperson declined to disclose the financial details of the transaction. The acquisition comes after TradeStation Crypto faced regulatory challenges, including a $3 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over a lending service. After this incident, TradeStation’s parent company withdrew from the cryptocurrency space. TradeStation Crypto gained attention for its involvement in Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez’s initiative to establish the city as a crypto hub. Notably, the company commissioned the Miami Bull, an 11-foot, 3,000-pound statue unveiled by Mayor Suarez in early 2022. In addition to its U.S. expansion, Kraken has been making strides in the European Union. The exchange recently announced the acquisition of Netherlands-based crypto firm BCM and secured virtual asset service provider licenses across the region as part of its ongoing growth strategy.

Despite this setback, some investors maintain optimism for long-term gains, pointing to the possibility of a bullish trend triggered by Bitcoin Halving. However, ETH faces resistance even as it finds support at $2,850, with conflicting signals from technical indicators adding to market uncertainty. Ethereum, the leading altcoin by market capitalization, has not escaped the recent market downturn, witnessing a 2.50% decline in price. Worries about a potential descent to $3,000 have emerged following this setback and amid broader concerns of a significant market correction. Nevertheless, despite the current downturn, certain investors remain hopeful about Ethereum’s long-term trajectory. The historical precedent of Bitcoin Halving sparking an altcoin season hints at the potential for a future uptrend. With a market capitalization of $382 billion, Ethereum has experienced an 18% drop over recent weeks. However, the ETH price has found support around the 50% Fibonacci level, approximately $2,850. The consolidation on the weekly chart between the 50% and 61.80% Fibonacci levels has been prolonged by the latest downturn. The smaller rejection from the 50% Fib level suggests a possible bullish breakout, potentially leading to sustained levels above $3,000. Can Ethereum Regain Momentum? At its current trading price of $3,140, Ethereum displays an intraday Doji candle, highlighting the altcoin’s volatile nature. The resumption of an upward trend for Ethereum may occur if the market manages to avoid further losses. Technical indicators offer a mixed outlook for Ethereum. The bearish crossover in the MACD and signal lines on the weekly chart reflects the recent pullback phase. However, a rebound from the 50% Fib level in ETH price could reignite positive momentum. A potential breakout above the $3,265 resistance level may signal an entry opportunity for a bull run continuation. Such a scenario could test the formidable $4,000 resistance level, potentially resulting in a 25% increase. However, while the likelihood of a drop to $3,000 remains minimal, it still concerns investors amidst the current market conditions. The prevailing uncertainty prompts investors to carefully evaluate the potential outcomes for Ethereum’s price movement.

One of the primary avenues to participate in EigenLayer involves contributing to the security of Ethereum and amplifying interest in staking activities. Staking on Ethereum has gained considerable momentum, particularly with the surge in popularity of restaking methods, as discussed in recent discussions. In a noteworthy update, EigenLayer made its debut on the Ethereum mainnet, introducing its EigenDA data availability layer. Notable operators such as Coinbase Cloud and Google Cloud have joined as the protocol’s initial participants. Additionally, EigenLayer revealed six actively validated services that would benefit from its restaking mechanism, reinforcing its position in the ecosystem. This launch enables restakers on the platform to earn an additional yield on their staked ETH, a feature previously unavailable. Many users had initially deposited ETH into the protocol in anticipation of higher yields and speculated on potential airdrops as EigenLayer allocated restaking points. Accessing EigenLayer necessitates staking ETH, either by setting up a validator or utilizing a liquid staking protocol to acquire staking derivative tokens. Liquid staking tokens (LST) offer holders liquidity and can be obtained by depositing into designated protocols or through direct purchase. The surge in new validators underscores the increasing interest in contributing to Ethereum’s security through EigenLayer. Notably, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with The Merge in September 2022, allowing individuals to operate validators on the Beaconchain alongside the mainnet. Staking gained substantial traction following the Shapella upgrade in April 2023, which introduced the ability to withdraw staked ETH, enhancing user confidence in the security of their funds. At its peak in June 2023, the validator queue reached 96,000, prompting measures to maintain network stability. However, the queue gradually subsided, remaining below 10,000 from October 2023 to March of the following year. The resurgence of interest in restaking has propelled the validator entry queue to 20,000, reflecting robust demand to fortify the Ethereum network.

The collaboration, detailed in an official press release, entails a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two entities, outlining mutual objectives without legal binding. The joint efforts between Tether and Fuze aim to cover a spectrum of educational aspects within the digital asset domain, including cross-border payment solutions, compliance, regulatory framework development, and education for local financial institutions. Initiative to Drive Cryptocurrency Adoption At the heart of the collaboration lies a set of educational initiatives aimed at nurturing the uptake of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Stablecoins like Tether (USDT), specifically for facilitating cross-border transactions. These campaigns underscore the efficiency and accessibility advantages of employing digital assets compliantly, benefiting businesses and individuals across Turkey, the Middle East, and North Africa. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration, highlighting its potential to democratize access to digital assets in the targeted regions. Educational Programs and Workshops Tether and Fuze will collaborate on developing programs and workshops aimed at enhancing awareness and comprehension of digital assets and blockchain technology among local financial institutions and individuals. These initiatives will conform to evolving regulatory standards, ensuring compliance amidst regulatory changes. Focus on Practical Utility of Crypto Additionally, the partnership seeks to enlighten merchants and enterprises about the practical usefulness of digital assets such as Bitcoin and Tether for day-to-day transactions. Raising awareness and promoting adoption aims to showcase the tangible benefits of digital assets in routine operations. Engagement with Financial Institutions Efforts will extend to engaging local and regional banks and financial institutions, equipping them with knowledge and tools to effectively utilize stablecoins and digital assets for their clientele. Fuze’s Co-Founder and CEO, Mo Ali Yusuf, emphasized the importance of educating stakeholders across all levels to accelerate the digital assets landscape and maximize opportunities while maintaining security and trust. Market Performance and Challenges Tether’s USDT recently surpassed a market capitalization of $100 billion, marking a 9% year-to-date growth. It maintains a substantial lead over its closest competitor, USD Coin (USDC), with a market cap exceeding $71 billion. However, concerns about the quality of assets backing USDT persist in the crypto space, with a recent United Nations report citing Tron’s popularity in cyber fraud and money laundering activities in Southeast Asia. Tether has refuted these accusations, emphasizing its collaboration with law enforcement agencies and the traceability of its token.
