According to Chainalysis, the African crypto market is one of the fastest growing in the world, with an estimated $20 billion worth of transactions taking place per month. Meanwhile Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are positioned in bitcoin.com top 10 global countries by Cryptocurrency Adoption.","In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the appeal of decentralised currencies in Africa and discuss how they’re leading the way in the continent’s ever-evolving finance landscape.","For several years now, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have been having a transformative effect on various industries and markets across the globe. From the disruption of the gaming industry via the emergence of play-to-earn gaming and online casino with crypto deposit platforms to smart contracts that are being used everywhere, from healthcare to real estate, the impact is evident.","With the rise of the DeFi and GameFi sectors, it’s clear that the global crypto era is now in full swing, and it’s an industry that’s gaining noticeable traction across Africa. Approximately 1.2 million Africans now actively trade cryptocurrencies, with Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa leading the way. Decentralised crypto trading platforms like Paxful and LocalBitcoins bypass financial institutions and present new opportunities for residents to buy and sell crypto tokens.","In terms of which crypto tokens are leading the way in Africa, Bitcoin (BTC) holds the position of the most dominant digital currency, with a substantial user base and trading volume. BTC is accepted and used for various purposes, including remittances and as a store of value.","Altcoins, too, are becoming more widespread in the continent, particularly Ether (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB). Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities have fuelled its growth in the region, providing a solution to developers for building DApps (decentralised applications) that address Africa-specific challenges.","Additionally, several homegrown cryptocurrencies have emerged in recent years that are tailored to the local needs of the region. The Akoin token (AKN), for example, was founded by musical artist and humanitarian Akon as a means of powering a digital financial ecosystem in those regions with limited access to traditional banking services.","Cryptocurrencies offer several unique advantages, which, coupled with the economic stagnation still present in the continent, makes them particularly appealing to Africans.","One of the key drivers behind the burgeoning popularity of crypto in Africa is the lack of access to traditional financial services that many Africans still face. Many residents stay either unbanked or underbanked, excluding them from taking part in the global economy.","Decentralised currencies are gaining increased acceptance among the financially marginalised, particularly the low-income population, who have often been excluded from the banking system or had to face disproportionally high transaction costs. By their very nature, cryptocurrencies remove the need for traditional intermediaries, instead offering a borderless alternative that enables individuals to send and receive secure financial transactions instantly.","Currencies in countries such as Kenya and Nigeria have been damaged by decades of inflation, contributing to a surge in both economic and political instability. Cryptos hold the power to remedy financial exclusion and present an alternative to weak domestic currencies.","Unlike the more established traditional banking options in Africa, decentralised finance enables anyone with an internet connection and compatible device — smartphones included — to engage in a variety of financial transactions, from sending remittances to making investments. Crypto investing allows Africans to purchase and hold assets that will not be impacted by financial turbulence, such as rapid depreciation and ever-increasing inflation.","As mentioned above, cryptocurrencies are typically cheaper, easier to use and faster than conventional methods. The blockchain technology that eases peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions exists outside established fiat currency institutions, supplying a far more accessible and user-friendly solution.","Traditional remittance services are often slow, expensive and largely inaccessible to a significant portion of the African population. Digital currencies allow for frictionless cross-border transactions, meaning that individuals can send and receive money globally in a matter of minutes. Not only does this benefit individual consumers, but it also empowers African businesses and entrepreneurs, easing economic growth in the process.","Given that Africa’s crypto ecosystem is still in an evolutionary stage, the popularity of decentralised currencies and blockchain applications will vary between countries and regions. Regulatory environments, infrastructure development and specific social-economic conditions can all influence the popularity and success of a crypto project. However, there’s no denying that the emergence of this industry has sparked a wave of innovation throughout many African countries.","Several blockchain-based startups have found innovative ways to leverage the potential of the technology to address the most prevalent socio-economic challenges. BitPesa is transforming the cross-border payments sector, while other startups have used blockchain tech to make supply chain management more transparent and even improve voting processes. By leapfrogging traditional infrastructures, decentralised currencies and technologies are proving to be the key to sustainable, long-term economic growth in Africa.","","","Cryptocurrencies have disrupted traditional financial systems in recent years, and Bitcoin profiled itself as the most famous crypto. It has already found its way to e-commerce and investment, but this crypto is also present in the world of online gaming. In this article, we will explore the growing influence of Bitcoin in the online gaming world.","Thanks to Bitcoin’s integration into online casinos, players and operators now have a vast range of possibilities. With the use of Bitcoin, online casinos create another level of advantage over traditional payment options. Most of all, if you perform transactions in Bitcoin, they will be quicker and more efficient.","You can deposit or withdraw the funds within seconds without the need for complex verification processes or intermediaries. This makes the gaming experience smoother and more seamless for any player. Additionally, Bitcoin offers a higher level of privacy and security. We have already experienced how much financial and personal information traditional payment methods require.","Nevertheless, unlike them, Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, which means they provide players with greater anonymity. This privacy feature particularly appeals to those who value their online security and wish to enjoy online gaming without revealing their identities. Integrating Bitcoin into online casinos has also resulted in innovative bonus structures and rewards.","Some Bitcoin casinos offer exclusive promotions and bonuses for players who use Bitcoin as their preferred payment method. The best Bitcoin casinos in the Philippines are safe to deposit at, according to this guide, and you can choose the one that appeals to you the most. That’s why more and more players turn to Bitcoin as their payment method, fostering its further adoption in the gaming industry.","Since Bitcoin is decentralized, transactions bypass the regular censorship and control that we can see involved with traditional payment methods. Thanks to this, players from regions with strict gambling regulations can participate in online gaming with fewer restrictions. Bitcoin-powered online casinos do not impose geographical limitations, opening their services to players worldwide.","Beyond online casinos, Bitcoin has made significant breakthroughs in esports betting. We could witness a skyrocketing rise of esports in recent years, which resulted in millions of enthusiasts and viewers worldwide. Thanks to Bitcoin’s integration into esports, players have a wider range of options to engage with their favorite games and gamers.","Esports, or competitive video gaming, has witnessed a meteoric rise in popularity, attracting millions of viewers and enthusiasts worldwide. Bitcoin’s integration into esports betting platforms has revolutionized how fans engage with their favorite games and players.","Bitcoin’s advantages, such as fast and secure transactions, align perfectly with the dynamic nature of esports betting. Users can easily deposit and withdraw funds, allowing for quick reactions to changing odds or game outcomes. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature also ensures that bettors from any location can participate, overcoming the obstacles of regional restrictions and currency exchange complications.","Moreover, Bitcoin’s integration into esports betting platforms has provided players with increased transparency and fairness. The technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, allows for unalterable and auditable records of transactions, ensuring that betting outcomes are tamper-proof.","This transparency has fostered greater trust among players, operators, and regulators, further fueling the growth of Bitcoin-powered esports betting.","As the gaming industry evolves, it has also opened innovative ways for gamers to enhance their gaming experience. With the involvement of Bitcoin, players can use it for in-game purchases. Nowadays, many popular online games support cryptocurrencies for item purchases, upgrades, or other enhancements.","Since crypto transactions are more seamless, Bitcoin has become a better alternative compared to traditional in-game payment methods. Game developers have also benefited from introducing Bitcoin as a payment option. Now they can offer a more convenient way of purchasing in-game items, transaction fees are lower, and processing times have become faster.","Moreover, you, as a player, don’t need to disclose any sensitive information anymore. That way, Bitcoin usage in gaming reduces the risk of potential data breaches. The adoption of Bitcoin in in-game purchases has also opened up new possibilities for cross-platform transactions.","As Bitcoin operates globally, players can easily trade or transfer in-game assets across different games or platforms, fostering a vibrant secondary market for virtual goods. This flexibility enhances player engagement and allows for a more interconnected gaming experience.","The integration of Bitcoin into in-game purchases has also paved the way for blockchain-based gaming ecosystems. Some game developers have embraced blockchain technology to create decentralized gaming platforms where players truly own their in-game assets through blockchain-based tokens. This ownership empowers players and introduces concepts of shortage and value to virtual items.","","Players can enjoy multiple benefits from using Bitcoin in online gaming. The most obvious one is that traditional payment methods cannot match the level of Bitcoin’s security and anonymity. Due to cryptos’ decentralized nature, you don’t need to disclose your sensitive data. If you want to get started in the gaming world easily and quickly, there’s no more attractive option than Bitcoin.","Transactions are completed within seconds, and they are cheaper in terms of fees compared to other popular methods. Since Bitcoin has become more popular in the online gaming industry, gaming platforms recognized its benefits.","Therefore, they introduced it as a payment method, and nowadays, the world’s most popular online gaming platforms accept Bitcoin, including Steam, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.","While Bitcoin offers many benefits for online gaming, such as fast and secure transactions, there are also some security considerations to keep in mind. Performing online financial transactions always brings a high risk of potential hacking and theft of Bitcoin wallets. That’s why you should use a secure and reputable digital wallet and keep your private keys safe and inaccessible to unauthorized persons.","Also, online gaming platforms that you use should have strong security features established to keep your financial and personal information away from the eyes of unauthorized third parties.","Bitcoin’s rise in online gaming has brought many benefits for all entities in this growing industry. From online casinos to esports betting and in-game purchases, Bitcoin’s unique characteristics have reshaped the gaming landscape, offering increased speed, privacy, security, and global accessibility. It shouldn’t take too long before cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance since they are continuously evolving.","That’s why we believe the Bitcoin integration in the online gaming industry will continue. Ultimately, it should unlock new ways of innovation and interaction for gaming fans worldwide, leading to limitless possibilities for the future of online gaming.","","","Are you a passionate NHL fan who craves excitement both on and off the ice?

Over the years, there have been significant developments in the NBA’s interaction with cryptocurrency. Let’s explore the influence of cryptocurrency on NBA odds and how it has affected the world of sports betting.","The influence of cryptocurrency on NBA odds has been an intriguing development in the world of sports betting. Cryptocurrency, with its decentralized and digital nature, has presented unique opportunities and challenges for NBA betting enthusiasts.","One aspect to consider is the volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The prices of these digital assets can experience rapid fluctuations due to various factors such as market sentiment, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. These price movements can directly impact the odds offered by sportsbooks for NBA games.","Crypto-related news and developments have also played a significant role in shaping NBA odds. Positive news, such as NBA teams embracing cryptocurrencies and forming partnerships with blockchain companies, can create a sense of optimism among bettors. These developments can potentially lead to more favorable odds for teams associated with crypto initiatives.","There have been instances where cryptocurrency fluctuations have influenced NBA games and their odds. For example, if a team associated with a crypto-focused sponsorship or partnership experiences a surge in popularity due to positive crypto-related news, the odds of that team winning might decrease, as more bettors may be inclined to place wagers on them. Conversely, if a team’s crypto partner faces significant negative developments, the odds might shift in favor of their opponents.","Cryptocurrency volatility can present opportunities for astute bettors to leverage these price movements in NBA betting. Some strategies that can be employed include:","To effectively leverage cryptocurrency volatility in NBA betting, understanding market sentiment and crypto trends is essential. Following reputable cryptocurrency news sources and staying updated on the latest developments can provide valuable insights into how the market might react and influence NBA odds.","Monitoring social media platforms and forums frequented by crypto enthusiasts can also offer insights into the prevailing sentiment and potential market movements.","Technical analysis, a commonly used approach in cryptocurrency trading, can also be applied to NBA betting to gain predictive insights. By analyzing historical data, identifying patterns, and utilizing indicators, bettors can make informed decisions on which teams to bet on. However, it’s important to note that technical analysis is not foolproof and should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis and research.","In recent years, the rise of crypto-focused NBA betting platforms has provided bettors with specialized options tailored to crypto-savvy individuals. These platforms offer unique features and advantages that cater to the growing demand for crypto-based betting in the NBA.","Specialized platforms catering to crypto-savvy bettors have emerged, offering NBA betting opportunities with cryptocurrency as the primary payment method.

Factors to consider include:","NBA players have embraced cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, leading to a synergistic connection between the league and the crypto space. This connection manifests in various ways, including player endorsements, investments, and partnerships.","In conclusion, the harnessing of cryptocurrency volatility in NBA betting has emerged as a captivating avenue for bettors seeking a winning edge.

The committee is keen on facilitating the development of a crypto regulatory framework that can enable Kenyans to carry out safe and secure crypto transactions. Moreover, the committee also noted that having regulations on cryptocurrency use in the country will help Kenya to harness the benefits of financial innovation while curtailing the risks associated with digital assets. The committee also stated that it is committed to accelerating the implementation of the country’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).","Despite these new developments, the CBK hasn’t outrightly changed its stance on virtual currencies like Bitcoin not being a legal tender. However, the CBK, in 2022, published a discussion paper calling on Kenyans to share their opinions on CBDC as it looked to explore the potential implementation of a CBDC.","The Bank of Zambia and the country’s securities regulator are currently testing technology to allow for the regulation of cryptocurrencies. The news was shared by Zambia’s Technology and Science Minister, Felix Mutati, on the ministry’s website in a move that is aimed at achieving an inclusive digital country.","Speaking about the news, Mutati stated that cryptocurrency is the future that the country desires to achieve,” but a policy framework is required to support this “revolutionary technology.” He went ahead to state that the testing of the technology that will potentially be used to regulate cryptocurrencies in the country will be upscaled in due time as part of deliberate efforts to achieve an inclusive digital economy in the country.","In addition, the minister also claimed that Zambia aspires to become a technology hub in Africa by developing digital infrastructure and attracting investments in the sector.","Momint, a South African startup, recently announced that it had launched a blockchain-powered solution that can alleviate the country’s energy distress by installing more rooftop solar systems in public institutions such as schools and hospitals.","The company has so far piloted the solution at one local school – Delmas High School – in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, according to a news report published by News 24.

The first clause makes it mandatory for adverts, including crypto offerings, to clearly express that crypto investments may result in the loss of capital given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. In addition, crypto adverts should not contradict warnings about potential investment losses that investors may face.","The clause also went ahead to emphasize that adverts for particular services and products must be explained in an easily understandable manner for the target audience. Advertisements must also have balanced messages around benefits, features, returns, and risks associated with the particular service or product.","Rates of returns, projections, or any kind of forecasts must also be sufficiently substantiated, including how they are calculated and what conditions apply to touted returns. Moreover, any information relating to a crypto product or service’s past performance will not be used to promise future performance or returns, and should, therefore, not be presented in a way that creates ‘a favourable impression of the advertised product or service.’","The clause went on to state that adverts from crypto service providers who aren’t registered credit providers should not push for the acquisition of digital currencies using credit.

The newspaper shared that if the Investments and Securities Act 2007 (Amendment) Bill is signed into law, it would permit the local Securities and Exchange Commission to “recognise cryptocurrency and other digital funds as capital for investment.”","Speaking about the proposed bill, Ibrahim said, “Like I said earlier during the second reading, we need an efficient and vibrant capital market in Nigeria. For us to do that, we have to be up to date [with] global practices.”","The report comes nearly 24 months after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) ordered Nigerian crypto exchanges and service providers to cease any crypto-related activity and instructed all banks to shut down the accounts of any individuals or entities found to be engaging in crypto-related activities.","Ibrahim, however, noted that the law will not be a 180-degree turn on the ban issued in February 2021. Rather, it will be a secondary review of what is within the mandate of the CBN’s powers.","In addition to the proposed legal recognition of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the law will also outline the regulatory roles of the CBN and Nigeria’s Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on matters relating to digital currencies. The new law also comes at a time when Nigerians have continued to show little to no interest in the country’s central bank digital currency, the eNaira.","The Central African Republic (CAR) has announced that it will delay the listing of the digital currency, Sango Coin, on various crypto exchanges citing current market conditions plus marketing reasons.","The announcement was shared in the cryptocurrency’s Telegram group. The coin was launched in July 2022 following the country’s acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender in April, a move that saw it become the first country in Africa to do so. Additionally, CAR planned to raise close to $1 billion through the sale of the Sango Coin over the next 12 months.","The country planned to do this by offering attractive incentives to foreign investors, such as a CAR passport and citizenship by investment, among others. However, while only $1.66 million worth of the coin has been sold so far, the move to have foreigner purchase the country’s citizenship was also blocked and deemed unconstitutional by CAR’s top court in August.","While the Central African Republic has faced various challenges since its adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, it does not take away how significant the move is in the widespread adoption of Bitcoin.","A new study done by the Moroccan think tank Policy Center for the New South (PCNS), which examined the rate of cryptocurrency ownership and its legality in 33 African countries, has found that Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya account for roughly 36.14 million crypto holders out of the 55.3 million crypto holders in the countries surveyed.","The survey dubbed “The emergence of cryptocurrencies in Africa: reality or overvaluation?” established that Nigeria has by far the largest number of cryptocurrency holders at 40.5% out of the 33 African countries that were surveyed. South Africa and Kenya followed closely with 7.71 million and six million crypto holders, respectively, to become the second and third-highest-ranked African countries.","Besides the three countries having the highest number of crypto holders out of the surveyed nations, the countries were the only ones whose proportion of holders relative to their population size was higher than 10%. However, using this metric, South Africa takes the lead at 12.27%, followed by Kenya at 11.85% and Nigeria at 10.33%.","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform that has partnered with UniPass to advance crypto adoption in Africa, and more.","Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform with a focus on gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and rewards, has announced the launch of the third version of its platform that features integration with UniPass, a non-custodial smart contract, enabling users to use their email addresses instead of seed phrases and gas.","The partnership will enable Cassava Network to onboard Africans from Web2 to Web3 as users will be able to create Cassava accounts and automatically sign up to UniPass where they will be able to send, receive, and store on-chain digital assets across various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains.","Speaking about the launch of the new platform version, Mouloukou Sanoh, Co-founder of Cassava Network, said, “Cassava v3 serves as a bridge for global Web3 businesses to connect with African Web2 users.”","Sanoh went ahead to mention that 90 percent of the partners engaging with the community feature of the new version are African businesses.","Benjamin Obenze, Cassava Network’s Business Developer, in an interview said that African users and businesses will be able to use the new platform version to enter Web3 spaces.","According to an analysis of Google searches done by Leverage Trading, Nigeria scored the second-highest globally (94) for searches related to crypto leverage in the last five years.","Singapore is the only country that outscored Nigeria with a score of 100 regarding searches but with more emphasis on transactional searches like ‘how to leverage trade crypto’.

Additionally, the proposed Bill is the first time that the East African country will bring digital currencies mainstream and establish regulations around cryptocurrencies. The Bill suggests a capital gains tax for the increased market value of crypto during its sale or use in a transaction. The proposed capital gains tax is akin to the excise duty tax charged by banks on transactions.","Interestingly, the fragments of the Bill are quite similar to the policy interventions that were published by UNCTAD in July 2022 and aimed at helping to curb the risks associated with cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. The Bill is being presented as an attempt to justify crypto regulations in the country as a way of protecting Kenyans from such investments.","Following the collapse of the crypto exchange, FTX, and the crypto bear market witnessed thus far in 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) claims that it might be time to push for calls to regulate the crypto markets in Africa in order to protect consumers.","While acknowledging that regulating a highly volatile decentralized system that is highly volatile remains a challenge for most governments, the IMF believes that a balance can be achieved that minimizes risks and innovation. According to the IMF, only one-quarter of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have formally regulated digital currencies. In contrast, two-thirds have enacted some restrictions, and only six countries have banned crypto.","Given that crypto assets are mainly used for commercial purposes, the IMF believes their volatility makes them unsuitable as a store of value. And considering that Africa has a fast-growing crypto market compared to other continents in the world, it might be an ideal time for policymakers to regulate the crypto space in the continent to avoid creating risks for financial and macroeconomic stability.","","The long-awaited World Cup 2022 is here, bringing many opportunities to win big.

Moreover, the CBK also believes that CBDC could be disruptive in the cross-border payment market by making it less costly and more efficient.","The bank will receive feedback and comments from the public until May 20, 2022, via email, fin@centralbank.go.ke, or through this online form.","In its February 2022 monetary report, the Central Bank of Zimbabwe has announced that it’s exploring the feasibility of rolling out its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), including specific design considerations, opportunities, and risks to the monetary and financial system.","A statement released by John Mangudya, the bank’s governor, said, “In this context, the Bank is developing a clear roadmap for adopting CBDC, encompassing the feasibility and assessment stage currently taking place, policy design stage based on results of the feasibility study and implementation modalities.”","In the report, the bank went ahead to state that it prefers a CBDC to cryptocurrencies. In December 2021, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe issued a warning to Zimbabweans using cryptocurrencies as an alternative payment method. Although the bank still doesn’t endorse cryptocurrencies, they are in consultation with different stakeholders to try and gather feedback to create policies on cryptocurrencies in the country.","Similar to Zimbabwe, the Central Bank of Zambia has announced that it’s exploring the potential of its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The report went ahead to state that the country hopes to finalise its research later in the year.","The bank’s move is geared towards cutting increasing citizens’ participation in the formal financial system. Just like Zimbabwe, Zambia still went ahead to warn its citizens on the use of cryptocurrencies, stating that anyone dealing with crypto should have a full understanding of all risks involved.","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform that has partnered with UniPass to advance crypto adoption in Africa, and more.","Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform with a focus on gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and rewards, has announced the launch of the third version of its platform that features integration with UniPass, a non-custodial smart contract, enabling users to use their email addresses instead of seed phrases and gas.","The partnership will enable Cassava Network to onboard Africans from Web2 to Web3 as users will be able to create Cassava accounts and automatically sign up to UniPass where they will be able to send, receive, and store on-chain digital assets across various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains.","Speaking about the launch of the new platform version, Mouloukou Sanoh, Co-founder of Cassava Network, said, “Cassava v3 serves as a bridge for global Web3 businesses to connect with African Web2 users.”","Sanoh went ahead to mention that 90 percent of the partners engaging with the community feature of the new version are African businesses.","Benjamin Obenze, Cassava Network’s Business Developer, in an interview said that African users and businesses will be able to use the new platform version to enter Web3 spaces.","According to an analysis of Google searches done by Leverage Trading, Nigeria scored the second-highest globally (94) for searches related to crypto leverage in the last five years.","Singapore is the only country that outscored Nigeria with a score of 100 regarding searches but with more emphasis on transactional searches like ‘how to leverage trade crypto’. South Africa and Ghana follow Nigeria closely as both countries have also dominated Google searches for the term ‘trade crypto.’","Despite Nigeria leading in the crypto leverage searches and South Africa and Ghana following closely, Leverage Trading established that Africa still lags behind when it comes to searches for the term ‘stock leverage.’","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about the Senate initiating talks with the Central Bank of Kenya to develop policies on digital assets, Zambia’s move to test the tech it desires to use for crypto regulation, and more.","The Committee on Information, Communication & Technology, under the Senate of the Republic of Kenya, has made its intention known that it will engage the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and other stakeholders to develop policies on the use of crypto assets and virtual service providers in the country.","The news was shared on the official Twitter page of the Senate of Kenya. The committee is keen on facilitating the development of a crypto regulatory framework that can enable Kenyans to carry out safe and secure crypto transactions. Moreover, the committee also noted that having regulations on cryptocurrency use in the country will help Kenya to harness the benefits of financial innovation while curtailing the risks associated with digital assets. The committee also stated that it is committed to accelerating the implementation of the country’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).","Despite these new developments, the CBK hasn’t outrightly changed its stance on virtual currencies like Bitcoin not being a legal tender. However, the CBK, in 2022, published a discussion paper calling on Kenyans to share their opinions on CBDC as it looked to explore the potential implementation of a CBDC.","The Bank of Zambia and the country’s securities regulator are currently testing technology to allow for the regulation of cryptocurrencies. The news was shared by Zambia’s Technology and Science Minister, Felix Mutati, on the ministry’s website in a move that is aimed at achieving an inclusive digital country.","Speaking about the news, Mutati stated that cryptocurrency is the future that the country desires to achieve,” but a policy framework is required to support this “revolutionary technology.” He went ahead to state that the testing of the technology that will potentially be used to regulate cryptocurrencies in the country will be upscaled in due time as part of deliberate efforts to achieve an inclusive digital economy in the country.","In addition, the minister also claimed that Zambia aspires to become a technology hub in Africa by developing digital infrastructure and attracting investments in the sector.","Momint, a South African startup, recently announced that it had launched a blockchain-powered solution that can alleviate the country’s energy distress by installing more rooftop solar systems in public institutions such as schools and hospitals.","The company has so far piloted the solution at one local school – Delmas High School – in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, according to a news report published by News 24.

The first clause makes it mandatory for adverts, including crypto offerings, to clearly express that crypto investments may result in the loss of capital given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. In addition, crypto adverts should not contradict warnings about potential investment losses that investors may face.","The clause also went ahead to emphasize that adverts for particular services and products must be explained in an easily understandable manner for the target audience. Advertisements must also have balanced messages around benefits, features, returns, and risks associated with the particular service or product.","Rates of returns, projections, or any kind of forecasts must also be sufficiently substantiated, including how they are calculated and what conditions apply to touted returns. Moreover, any information relating to a crypto product or service’s past performance will not be used to promise future performance or returns, and should, therefore, not be presented in a way that creates ‘a favourable impression of the advertised product or service.’","The clause went on to state that adverts from crypto service providers who aren’t registered credit providers should not push for the acquisition of digital currencies using credit. However, this does not prevent the advertising of associated payment methods provided by crypto service providers.

Sometimes they make our work easier and efficient. Sometimes they bring in new ways to do them. The Internet and open-source revolution has already made our world better in many ways, while also bringing new problems of their own. Blockchain technology is the new forefront where similar things can happen. There are many applications of blockchain technology that aim at revolutionizing various industries and commerce. But can it really change our societies too?","In the words of Dev Sharma, CEO and founder of Blockwiz, “Blockchains have the potential to drive some much-needed social changes in our current structures. It can bring social justice through securing records like car ownerships and reduce malpractices by its transparency when applied to supply chains and government spending. The potential is vast and often threatening to authoritarian systems where power is used in the wrong way.”","The world has already started revolting against the misuse of authority and power by public and private institutions. This has brought us laws and policies that protect our privacy and security on the internet. Similar movements have come and faded in the past because efficient systems that can replace the current ones had been missing for the most part. However, with blockchain technology at our side, many such movements can find solid footing now.","Most resolvable social problems arise due to current systems being susceptible to tampering and lacking transparency. Being centralized and hierarchical, these systems have multiple points of failure. This leads to corruption, unreliability, and excessive resource costs. All this can be solved by implementing blockchains in these systems. They can also be used to automate traffic management, property management, tax, fine collections, etc; activities that are vulnerable to misuse and corruption.","“History suggests that centralized systems of governance had failed for the same reason. The unequal distribution of power and misuse had brought down empires. Democracy and federal governance being the closest to decentralization we could get, it is still very vulnerable to socio-political injustice. And needless to say, very inefficient as well. The last two decades have seen a tremendous rise in technology but their direct use to solve socio-political problems has been limited. However, blockchain technology can be a direct solution to many of them.” added Mr. Sharma of the Canada-based crypto marketing agency.","The concept of smart cities has already taken these applications into account. While the use may be limited to public systems and operations, it can be easily extended to governmental and legal systems. Our current technologies are capable of managing and resolving many small needs of our societies without human intervention or oversight. The only roadblock to a technology-driven social change is the implementation and their use. Especially now, when we have the solutions and yet the problems remain!","Nigeria is ranked as Africa’s largest country with the most crypto traders and ranks third globally. The country accounts for the largest volume of cryptocurrency transactions outside the United States. In the last six months, it has been recorded that about 35% of the Nigerian population has traded cryptocurrency.","As encouraging as these numbers may be, Nigeria, as an environment, has been very unfriendly to cryptocurrency and its related aspects. Last year, the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all commercial banks and lenders to stop transactions or operations in cryptocurrencies, citing a significant threat to the country’s financial system.","The ban on cryptocurrency in Nigeria was big negativity to the Nigerian youth, especially knowing that over 50 million of the population are involved in cryptocurrency. During this time, a lot of crypto trading platforms were shut down in the country. Also, many bank accounts suspected of dealing with cryptocurrency were locked, including their funds.","Even today (as of May 27, 2022), any bank transaction with a description or notes of “crypto,” “bitcoin,” “P2P,” or any crypto-related words will be locked away alongside the account(s).","The unfriendly treatment of cryptocurrency in the country is alarming. In the plight of making a positive solution, the community led to adopting systems where crypto traders could trade cryptocurrency without involving the bank.","Today, finding the right crypto trading platform that works for you significantly can be frustrating. Many cryptocurrency exchanges came into existence to aid in safer cryptocurrency transactions in the country. In this plight, some fraudulent platforms were made in disguise to exploit money from crypto investors. How would Nigerian crypto traders know which platform is genuine or not? With some checklists for selecting the best crypto exchange in Nigeria, you will be given key guidelines on how to choose the best place to sell bitcoin in Nigeria.","A fast crypto transaction is important as the speed of cryptocurrency may block. Most times, transactions take hours to complete. Ideally, crypto transactions on regular crypto trading platforms take between 10 minutes to one hour. Surprisingly, some take over 5 hours. However, a few crypto transactions can take less than five minutes, depending on the app. In cases where we need transactions done quickly, or we accept crypto payments for your business, how do we intend to confirm payment before allowing customers to take their products? Should the customer wait for hours?","The speed of transactions has been a damaging factor for most Nigerian crypto traders. This has been a reason why many Nigerian companies find it difficult to accept cryptocurrency as payment options for their businesses.","Crypto transaction fees are another issue many Nigerians face. To really compare the best options for you, you have to look at the fees before and after conversion. What are the withdrawal fees, processing fees, and receiving fees,… These fees cause a huge discouragement in crypto trading in the country.","It is saddening that many Nigerian crypto traders cannot make transactions because many of these crypto trading apps have put some limits on how much they can withdraw, receive, buy or sell. This breaches the purpose of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency has made it easy for people to send money from one place to another without a barrier. Why should I not be able to receive my funds because it is below your limit for withdrawal?","Limitations have made many Nigerians lose interest in cryptocurrency or lose their cryptos.","These factors, alongside many others, have caused the trading of cryptocurrency in Nigeria very difficult.","Breet is an OTC crypto exchange platform that allows users and businesses who simply want to receive crypto and get a flat equivalent of their coin to convert their crypto to cash money immediately.","","With Breet’s over-the-counter system, you are saved from the hassle of boring explanations of what and how crypto works and tedious illustrations of cryptocurrency market charts. Breet enables users to securely convert and withdraw their crypto coin to cash money in less than five(5) minutes without the use of peer-to-peer trading or any third-party agent.","Breet is a revolutionary new way to convert and withdraw your crypto coin without the need for peer-to-peer trading or any third-party agent.

There are no hidden charges, no withdrawal fees, no processing fees and no receiving fees. There are zero charges with Breet. Breet’s free usage solves the issue of high and inconsistent charges for many Nigerian crypto traders.","","There is no limitation to how much you can receive or withdraw on Breet. You don’t have to have about 10,000 Naira worth of cryptocurrency before you can withdraw. You can even withdraw as low as 100 Naira with Breet Exchange.","Breet is simple, free and certified. There is not much sugar coating to tell before believing that Breet is, arguably, the best crypto trading platform in Nigeria currently. The incredible reviews on the Breet app give perfect evidence.","What more do you need? If not, a crypto exchange that makes crypto transactions easy and makes people happy. You should become a Breet user by downloading Breet mobile app available on all Android and iPhone devices.","Remember being a crypto trader in Nigeria can be challenging. This is why it is important for you to learn more about cryptocurrency and the latest news by doing your own research.","The much-anticipated transition of the Ethereum network from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus is finally taking place. The adaptation of PoS has always been the plan and a vital part of scaling Ethereum by future upgrades. However, abruptly shifting to PoS can pose significant technical and community challenges that are not as simple as using PoW to achieve network consensus. Having said that, what exactly are PoS and PoW?","Proof-of-work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm that allows for the secure, decentralised verification of transactions on a blockchain. In a PoW system, miners are responsible for verifying and committing transactions to the blockchain. During the verification process, miners compete against each other to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with cryptocurrency, and the transaction is added to the blockchain.","The Ethereum ecosystem has evolved at an astounding rate in the last year. This growth was primarily due to a significant emergence and explosion of NFTs and Decentralised Finance (DeFi) initiatives. While the change-over was imminent, some factors to be considered for the same are:","With so many downsides to its cap, PoW has many advantages, which is one of the main reasons it has been a reliable consensus for so long. The PoW consensus has been robust and secure all these years. But the consensus can be utilised by a cryptocurrency with a massive valuation and relatively simple use case, such as the bitcoin. With the amount of energy and power involved, it becomes difficult for individuals to meddle with a high valuation asset.","The consensus protocol Proof-of-stake (PoS) has been introduced to address the issue of over-mining. Proof of stake (PoS) is critical to understand because it could eventually replace the proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism that is currently used by most cryptocurrencies.","“PoS is a way to achieve decentralised consensus without using energy-intensive mining. It is an alternative to the more common proof of work algorithm. With PoS, a cryptocurrency’s blockchain is secured by its token holders who are required to lock up their tokens as stake and not by miners equipped with powerful hardware. It’s an energy-efficient, cost-effective and therefore, a popular choice for crypto giants like Ethereum,” states Dev Sharma, CEO of Blockwiz, a crypto marketing agency.","In contrast to PoW, in which the individual who completes the mathematical proof first is rewarded with new coins, with PoS, no new coins are created.","Proof-of-stake introduces several enhancements over the PoS mechanism:","Proof of stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm used by cryptocurrencies to determine who gets to create new blocks on the blockchain. PoS works by requiring users to lock up some of their currency in a smart contract called a stake. In return, they are given the right to validate blocks on the network and earn rewards.","The advantage of PoS is that it doesn’t require the massive energy consumption that PoW does. This non-dependency on massive energy utilisation makes it more environmentally friendly. It reduces the risk of centralisation since few users would be able to control the majority of the currency. Therefore, it’s no wonder that Ethereum is making the much-anticipated switch.","Named one of CB Insights’ 2022 Blockchain 50, an annual ranking of the most promising blockchain and crypto companies in the world.","Announced the appointment of Ehsan Haque as the General Counsel for Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region.","CEO Michael Wu was selected as a recipient of the “Top 100 CEOs in Innovation Award 2022” by Word Biz Magazine.","","Participated in Mina Foundation’s token sale, EthSign’s seed round, and Zecrey protocol’s angel round.","","World Biz Magazine: Michael Wu, CEO of Amber Group – interview WBM Top 100 Innovation CEO.","CNBC: For crypto to be adopted globally, we will have to comply with regulators: Crypto-trading platform.","Bloomberg: Bankers Who Stay in Hong Kong Are Rewarded With a Pay Bonanza.","Economist: EthSign raises $12 million in stable coin led by Sequoia Capital India, Mirana Ventures.","Forkast News: From crisis currency to consumer adoption: What next for crypto?","CoinDesk: Mina foundation raises $92M to accelerate adoption of Zero-Knowledge Proofs.","Cointelegraph: If the glass slipper doesn’t fit, smash it: Unraveling the myth of gender equality in crypto.","AMBCrypto: Amber Group strengthens management team with Ehsan Haque as EMEA General Counsel.","CoinCu: Zecrey protocol has raised $4M in an angel fundraising round.","Chain Debrief: Is the user experience in DeFi bad?

We’ve included a detailed breakdown, some tips, and tricks of the trade, and thrown in some inside scoops to get you that step ahead. Let’s dive in!","First, you’re going to need an account on the P2P trading platform Remitano. The platform has created peer-to-peer marketplaces around the world, with markets dominating in India, US, and the Philippines to name a few. This year, Remitano brought their services to South Africa, offering local traders not only an easy way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but also a convenient ZAR wallet that allows you to deposit and withdraw funds efficiently.","Registering is easy, and completing the simple KYC registration process is simple and should take a matter of minutes. Once you’re registered, let’s get into it.","The easiest and fastest way to make a profit selling Bitcoin is to buy for a lower price than you sell. Obvious, right? It really can be that simple. Assuming that you have Bitcoin (if not, find out how to buy Bitcoin from a local trader and pay in South African Rands), you’re going to need to create a sell advert selling the BTC for a little extra. How much extra is up to you to decide, but remember not to get too wild with your markup otherwise you’re less likely to find a buyer.","Step 1: Establish your BTC price","You’re going to want to sell your BTC for profit, so make sure that you add an amount on the top of what you paid for it when creating your sell ad. You also want to ensure that your price is competitive, so check on another reputable platform to see what the going rate is.","E.g. If you bought BTC for R179,800 and it is selling for R181,634 on Luno, you might want to round up the price to R182,000 for your Sell ad. This will give you roughly R2,200 profit.","Step 2: Create a sell advert so you can sell BTC for profit","Now that you’re verified to sell on the platform and you’ve got a price in mind, it’s time to get to business! Head to your Dashboard, click on P2P Exchange in the dropdown menu, and select Your Advertisements. Then click “Create Ad”.","","Step 3: Enter the details of your Sell ad","In the form enter the details of your sell ad, like how much you’d like to sell for and how much BTC you have. The amount is calculated in ZAR/bitUSD and will show you the ZAR/BTC equivalent below.","You’ll also need to enter how much BTC you’d like to sell, and how you would like the funds to be paid. Here you have 3 options: bank transfer, Remitano ZAR wallet, and Chipper Cash.","","FYI: If you are wanting to create a sell ad for another cryptocurrency you can simply click on the pencil icon in the top right corner (as per picture above) and change the details (as per picture below). On Remitano, traders can buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ripple.","","In the Create New Ad page you also have the option of exploring the Advanced settings, where you can adjust things like minimum and maximum BTC amount, whether to reject unverified buyers and check the payment window.","Now click “Create new advertisement”.","Step 4: Make a ZAR deposit to activate your account","In order for your ad to go live, you will need to deposit a small amount into your ZAR account, this lets the platform and the seller knows that you are serious about selling.","Step 5: Wait for a buyer","That’s it, once your ad is live you’ll be notified immediately if a buyer is interested in purchasing either a portion or the entire Bitcoin (the amount that you put up for sale). Once a buyer has expressed interest, they will make payment to your Remitano ZAR wallet and you will have 15 minutes to release the BTC once payment has been received.","When looking to take on selling BTC to earn extra profits, here are some top tips to remember:","Now you’re ready to start selling BTC at a profit.

This is why it is important for you to learn more about cryptocurrency and the latest news by doing your own research.","The much-anticipated transition of the Ethereum network from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus is finally taking place. The adaptation of PoS has always been the plan and a vital part of scaling Ethereum by future upgrades. However, abruptly shifting to PoS can pose significant technical and community challenges that are not as simple as using PoW to achieve network consensus. Having said that, what exactly are PoS and PoW?","Proof-of-work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm that allows for the secure, decentralised verification of transactions on a blockchain. In a PoW system, miners are responsible for verifying and committing transactions to the blockchain. During the verification process, miners compete against each other to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with cryptocurrency, and the transaction is added to the blockchain.","The Ethereum ecosystem has evolved at an astounding rate in the last year. This growth was primarily due to a significant emergence and explosion of NFTs and Decentralised Finance (DeFi) initiatives. While the change-over was imminent, some factors to be considered for the same are:","With so many downsides to its cap, PoW has many advantages, which is one of the main reasons it has been a reliable consensus for so long. The PoW consensus has been robust and secure all these years. But the consensus can be utilised by a cryptocurrency with a massive valuation and relatively simple use case, such as the bitcoin. With the amount of energy and power involved, it becomes difficult for individuals to meddle with a high valuation asset.","The consensus protocol Proof-of-stake (PoS) has been introduced to address the issue of over-mining. Proof of stake (PoS) is critical to understand because it could eventually replace the proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism that is currently used by most cryptocurrencies.","“PoS is a way to achieve decentralised consensus without using energy-intensive mining. It is an alternative to the more common proof of work algorithm. With PoS, a cryptocurrency’s blockchain is secured by its token holders who are required to lock up their tokens as stake and not by miners equipped with powerful hardware. It’s an energy-efficient, cost-effective and therefore, a popular choice for crypto giants like Ethereum,” states Dev Sharma, CEO of Blockwiz, a crypto marketing agency.","In contrast to PoW, in which the individual who completes the mathematical proof first is rewarded with new coins, with PoS, no new coins are created.","Proof-of-stake introduces several enhancements over the PoS mechanism:","Proof of stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm used by cryptocurrencies to determine who gets to create new blocks on the blockchain. PoS works by requiring users to lock up some of their currency in a smart contract called a stake. In return, they are given the right to validate blocks on the network and earn rewards.","The advantage of PoS is that it doesn’t require the massive energy consumption that PoW does. This non-dependency on massive energy utilisation makes it more environmentally friendly. It reduces the risk of centralisation since few users would be able to control the majority of the currency. Therefore, it’s no wonder that Ethereum is making the much-anticipated switch.","Named one of CB Insights’ 2022 Blockchain 50, an annual ranking of the most promising blockchain and crypto companies in the world.","Announced the appointment of Ehsan Haque as the General Counsel for Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region.","CEO Michael Wu was selected as a recipient of the “Top 100 CEOs in Innovation Award 2022” by Word Biz Magazine.","","Participated in Mina Foundation’s token sale, EthSign’s seed round, and Zecrey protocol’s angel round.","","World Biz Magazine: Michael Wu, CEO of Amber Group – interview WBM Top 100 Innovation CEO.","CNBC: For crypto to be adopted globally, we will have to comply with regulators: Crypto-trading platform.","Bloomberg: Bankers Who Stay in Hong Kong Are Rewarded With a Pay Bonanza.","Economist: EthSign raises $12 million in stable coin led by Sequoia Capital India, Mirana Ventures.","Forkast News: From crisis currency to consumer adoption: What next for crypto?","CoinDesk: Mina foundation raises $92M to accelerate adoption of Zero-Knowledge Proofs.","Cointelegraph: If the glass slipper doesn’t fit, smash it: Unraveling the myth of gender equality in crypto.","AMBCrypto: Amber Group strengthens management team with Ehsan Haque as EMEA General Counsel.","CoinCu: Zecrey protocol has raised $4M in an angel fundraising round.","Chain Debrief: Is the user experience in DeFi bad?

However, the CMA issued a warning cautioning crypto investors that cryptoassets are not entirely safe due to their highly volatile nature and susceptibility to hacking.","In the report, CMA said, “Increased trading of cryptoassets by emerging market users can potentially lead to destabilising capital flows. Emerging market and developing economies faced with these risks are encouraged to prioritise strengthening macro policies and consider the benefits of issuing central bank digital currencies.”","While the CMA did not suggest a ban, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said is impossible, it suggested playing withing the trade instead of controlling it. The news comes barely a week after the Central Bank of Kenya published a discussion paper on the potential of CBDC in the country.","","Bitcoin Events, the host of the annual Blockchain Africa Conference, has announced that this year’s conference will take place virtually between March 17–18, 2022.","In its eighth edition, the event is expected to have a combined audience of over 2,500 delegates from 80 countries across the globe. The event comes at a time when there has been increased awareness of blockchain as a technology and its applications, especially in decentralised finance.","Given the massive global adoption of blockchain technology, the theme for this year’s conference is titled ‘Ready for Business?’, which is in line with the evolution of the conference’s theme over the years from ‘Beyond the Hype’ to ‘From Hype to Mainstream’.","Besides the Blockchain Africa Conference 2022, Bitcoin Events will also be hosting the DeFi Conference 2022 on August 5, 2022, and the fourth edition of Crypto Fest on October 28, 2022. While the DeFi Conference will be an online event, the Crypto Fest event will be an in-person event that will be held in Cape Town, South Africa.","According to Bloomberg, the main stock exchange in Nigeria is planning to digitize its equity sales process to enable companies to attract younger buyers who are interested in cryptocurrencies and foreign assets instead of local public companies.","This is following the MTN share sale in December 2021 that was described as ground-breaking by Temi Popoola, Chief Executive Officer of the Lagos-based Nigeria Exchange Ltd. For the first time, the exchange offered a stock issue to investors “end to end” electronically and the sales ended up being 1.2 times oversubscribed, and 85% of the investors were under the age of 40 years.","“In an age where investors’ needs are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the burgeoning youth demography are depending more on technology to transact business, our goal is to spur the next wave of growth,” said Popoola.","While young Nigerians have steered away from trading local equities, they are instead, actively buying and selling crypto which according to Paxful, accounts for the largest trading volumes outside the US.","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform that has partnered with UniPass to advance crypto adoption in Africa, and more.","Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform with a focus on gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and rewards, has announced the launch of the third version of its platform that features integration with UniPass, a non-custodial smart contract, enabling users to use their email addresses instead of seed phrases and gas.","The partnership will enable Cassava Network to onboard Africans from Web2 to Web3 as users will be able to create Cassava accounts and automatically sign up to UniPass where they will be able to send, receive, and store on-chain digital assets across various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains.","Speaking about the launch of the new platform version, Mouloukou Sanoh, Co-founder of Cassava Network, said, “Cassava v3 serves as a bridge for global Web3 businesses to connect with African Web2 users.”","Sanoh went ahead to mention that 90 percent of the partners engaging with the community feature of the new version are African businesses.","Benjamin Obenze, Cassava Network’s Business Developer, in an interview said that African users and businesses will be able to use the new platform version to enter Web3 spaces.","According to an analysis of Google searches done by Leverage Trading, Nigeria scored the second-highest globally (94) for searches related to crypto leverage in the last five years.","Singapore is the only country that outscored Nigeria with a score of 100 regarding searches but with more emphasis on transactional searches like ‘how to leverage trade crypto’. South Africa and Ghana follow Nigeria closely as both countries have also dominated Google searches for the term ‘trade crypto.’","Despite Nigeria leading in the crypto leverage searches and South Africa and Ghana following closely, Leverage Trading established that Africa still lags behind when it comes to searches for the term ‘stock leverage.’","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about the Senate initiating talks with the Central Bank of Kenya to develop policies on digital assets, Zambia’s move to test the tech it desires to use for crypto regulation, and more.","The Committee on Information, Communication & Technology, under the Senate of the Republic of Kenya, has made its intention known that it will engage the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and other stakeholders to develop policies on the use of crypto assets and virtual service providers in the country.","The news was shared on the official Twitter page of the Senate of Kenya. The committee is keen on facilitating the development of a crypto regulatory framework that can enable Kenyans to carry out safe and secure crypto transactions. Moreover, the committee also noted that having regulations on cryptocurrency use in the country will help Kenya to harness the benefits of financial innovation while curtailing the risks associated with digital assets. The committee also stated that it is committed to accelerating the implementation of the country’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).","Despite these new developments, the CBK hasn’t outrightly changed its stance on virtual currencies like Bitcoin not being a legal tender. However, the CBK, in 2022, published a discussion paper calling on Kenyans to share their opinions on CBDC as it looked to explore the potential implementation of a CBDC.","The Bank of Zambia and the country’s securities regulator are currently testing technology to allow for the regulation of cryptocurrencies. The news was shared by Zambia’s Technology and Science Minister, Felix Mutati, on the ministry’s website in a move that is aimed at achieving an inclusive digital country.","Speaking about the news, Mutati stated that cryptocurrency is the future that the country desires to achieve,” but a policy framework is required to support this “revolutionary technology.” He went ahead to state that the testing of the technology that will potentially be used to regulate cryptocurrencies in the country will be upscaled in due time as part of deliberate efforts to achieve an inclusive digital economy in the country.","In addition, the minister also claimed that Zambia aspires to become a technology hub in Africa by developing digital infrastructure and attracting investments in the sector.","Momint, a South African startup, recently announced that it had launched a blockchain-powered solution that can alleviate the country’s energy distress by installing more rooftop solar systems in public institutions such as schools and hospitals.","The company has so far piloted the solution at one local school – Delmas High School – in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, according to a news report published by News 24. According to the report, investors who are keen to participate in the project can do so by acquiring non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are linked to solar cells and retail for just under $9.","The solar cells will then be leased to institutions that agree to buy the generated electricity through a standard power purchase agreement.","Speaking of his company’s solution, Ahren Posthumus, Momint’s CEO, said, “We are a technology company that’s trying to build for the next 15 years, but what we realized is we can’t build a technology company in a country that doesn’t have electricity.”","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about South Africa’s new clause on its advertising code targeted towards the cryptocurrency sector and more.","The South African Advertising Regulatory Board (ARB) has introduced a new clause targeted at the crypto industry and aimed at protecting consumers from unethical advertising.","According to the new clause introduced to Section III of the country’s advertising code, both companies and individuals in South Africa will be required to abide by certain advertising standards in relation to the provision of crypto products and services. The first clause makes it mandatory for adverts, including crypto offerings, to clearly express that crypto investments may result in the loss of capital given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. In addition, crypto adverts should not contradict warnings about potential investment losses that investors may face.","The clause also went ahead to emphasize that adverts for particular services and products must be explained in an easily understandable manner for the target audience. Advertisements must also have balanced messages around benefits, features, returns, and risks associated with the particular service or product.","Rates of returns, projections, or any kind of forecasts must also be sufficiently substantiated, including how they are calculated and what conditions apply to touted returns. Moreover, any information relating to a crypto product or service’s past performance will not be used to promise future performance or returns, and should, therefore, not be presented in a way that creates ‘a favourable impression of the advertised product or service.’","The clause went on to state that adverts from crypto service providers who aren’t registered credit providers should not push for the acquisition of digital currencies using credit. However, this does not prevent the advertising of associated payment methods provided by crypto service providers. In the same breadth, brand ambassadors and social media influencers will also be expected to comply with certain advertising standards, such as sharing factual information and not offering advice on investing or trading in crypto assets as well as the prohibition of promises of benefits or returns.","Central African Republic (CAR) has set up a 15-member committee that will be responsible for developing a bill on the use of cryptocurrencies and tokenization in the region.","Once developed, the legal framework will enable cryptocurrencies to operate in the Central African Republic and expedite the development of the country’s economy.

How Activists Can Use Bitcoin","content":["As social justice movements leverage social media platforms like Twitter to make their voices heard, many have discovered a new tool: Bitcoin. The internet is the epicentre of social change, and it only makes sense that activists are now adding bitcoin to their arsenal. During the recent #EndSARS Nigerian campaign, young feminists raised $55,000 in cash and bitcoin donations, which is an example of how activists can use bitcoin to raise funds.","So, can cryptocurrencies provide the same level of impact on activism as social media platforms? This article explores how activists can use bitcoin.","","Any activist willing to protest against injustice should know how to raise money. Protesters need banners, water, food, and medical care in case they get hurt. These requirements come at a cost, necessitating movements to search for funds.","Activists can raise money out of pocket or they can reach out to well-wishers for donations. The former option is unreliable, which means that social justice movements have to fully rely on donations. Unfortunately, government censorship can make it hard for such movements to receive donations through banks and other conventional financial institutions. Moreover, they could punish the donors that support social justice campaigns.","The #EndSARS campaign, for instance, has faced challenges with receiving donations because the Flutterwave links were down for some time. According to Tweets on the Feminist Coalition account, the Central Bank of Nigeria could have been behind the Flutterwave payment issues. However, it is unclear. Flutterwave is a payment solution in Nigeria, while the Feminist Coalition is one of the organisations that has been active in raising donations for the campaign.","Furthermore, donors outside the country where a campaign is taking place will find it challenging to send donations due to the high cost of sending money. Also, online payment platforms like PayPal are not available in every country. That prevents people in these countries from making donations to campaigns happening in other parts of the world.","Speed is also important when collecting donations. Activists will often need funds immediately to keep a campaign going long enough to make an impact. Therefore, if they are not receiving cash directly, they might have to visit a bank to withdraw large amounts of money. That could waste a lot of precious time.","","Yes, they can.","Bitcoin is censorship-resistant, which means that governments cannot prevent activists from receiving donations in bitcoin. That provides the convenience that activists need to fund their campaigns when they are still “hot” enough to make a difference.","To solve the challenge of receiving donations through Flutterwave, the Feminist Coalition is now accepting bitcoin donations only.","Bitcoin is pseudonymous, which means that governments cannot easily trace bitcoin transactions to the real-world identities of the senders and recipients. That offers a sense of security to both donors and activists, especially in countries where protesting can mean beatings, jail time, or death.","It is even better when social justice movements are decentralised because there are no public leaders that law enforcement can pursue. For instance, much of the #EndSARS and #BlackLivesMatter campaigns grew organically online.","Therefore, activists can use bitcoin to receive pseudonymous and censorship-resistant donations.","Moreover, they can receive donations from anywhere at any time. That is because bitcoin is accessible 24/7 to anyone with a smartphone or computer and an internet connection. As a result, more people can financially support causes they believe in, even though they live on another continent.","Also, bitcoin transactions do not involve third parties, thereby cutting down the cost and increasing transaction speeds. Once a donor sends BTC, the activist will receive it in minutes and fund their campaign immediately.","Furthermore, buying supplies for a protest becomes easier when local businesses start accepting crypto payments. For instance, several local businesses started accepting cryptocurrencies in 2019 in support of the Hong Kong protests against Chinese influence.","Fighting deep-rooted social injustices require bridging the wealth gap between the oppressors and the oppressed.","In a world where the wealthy influence political decisions in their favour, amassing wealth could be a possible solution that marginalised communities can adopt to fight discrimination.","Here is where bitcoin can come in.","Since marginalised communities suffer discrimination from traditional financial institutions, bitcoin becomes an attractive alternative. The censorship-resistant and easy accessibility of bitcoin means that marginalised communities can use it to create wealth and acquire financial freedom and the power to fight prejudices.","By way of illustration, activists can direct part of the bitcoin donations they receive to fund small businesses in the community. As a result, financially stronger businesses can create jobs and increase the purchasing power of other community members.","Other methods that communities can use to create wealth include buying and holding bitcoin and accessing business loans in crypto.","Money can help fight police brutality better than protesting on the streets. That is what Bitcoin and Black America author, Isaiah Jackson, believes.","“Without economic strength, you have cops coming from outside of the community […], and they do not value it [or the people]. They do not see you as a person, and that is an issue,” he told Cointelegraph.","Moreover, marginalised communities can create their tokens or community currencies to improve their financial positions.","Social media has made the world aware of the social injustices that take place in various parts of the world. Now, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are giving the world a chance to support social justice movements financially. Together, both tools are creating a world where no one has to fight injustices alone.","Cryptocurrency adoption is on the rise throughout Africa. According to Chainalysis, the African crypto market is one of the fastest growing in the world, with an estimated $20 billion worth of transactions taking place per month. Meanwhile Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are positioned in bitcoin.com top 10 global countries by Cryptocurrency Adoption.","In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the appeal of decentralised currencies in Africa and discuss how they’re leading the way in the continent’s ever-evolving finance landscape.","For several years now, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have been having a transformative effect on various industries and markets across the globe. From the disruption of the gaming industry via the emergence of play-to-earn gaming and online casino with crypto deposit platforms to smart contracts that are being used everywhere, from healthcare to real estate, the impact is evident.","With the rise of the DeFi and GameFi sectors, it’s clear that the global crypto era is now in full swing, and it’s an industry that’s gaining noticeable traction across Africa. Approximately 1.2 million Africans now actively trade cryptocurrencies, with Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa leading the way. Decentralised crypto trading platforms like Paxful and LocalBitcoins bypass financial institutions and present new opportunities for residents to buy and sell crypto tokens.","In terms of which crypto tokens are leading the way in Africa, Bitcoin (BTC) holds the position of the most dominant digital currency, with a substantial user base and trading volume. BTC is accepted and used for various purposes, including remittances and as a store of value.","Altcoins, too, are becoming more widespread in the continent, particularly Ether (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB). Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities have fuelled its growth in the region, providing a solution to developers for building DApps (decentralised applications) that address Africa-specific challenges.","Additionally, several homegrown cryptocurrencies have emerged in recent years that are tailored to the local needs of the region. The Akoin token (AKN), for example, was founded by musical artist and humanitarian Akon as a means of powering a digital financial ecosystem in those regions with limited access to traditional banking services.","Cryptocurrencies offer several unique advantages, which, coupled with the economic stagnation still present in the continent, makes them particularly appealing to Africans.","One of the key drivers behind the burgeoning popularity of crypto in Africa is the lack of access to traditional financial services that many Africans still face. Many residents stay either unbanked or underbanked, excluding them from taking part in the global economy.","Decentralised currencies are gaining increased acceptance among the financially marginalised, particularly the low-income population, who have often been excluded from the banking system or had to face disproportionally high transaction costs. By their very nature, cryptocurrencies remove the need for traditional intermediaries, instead offering a borderless alternative that enables individuals to send and receive secure financial transactions instantly.","Currencies in countries such as Kenya and Nigeria have been damaged by decades of inflation, contributing to a surge in both economic and political instability. Cryptos hold the power to remedy financial exclusion and present an alternative to weak domestic currencies.","Unlike the more established traditional banking options in Africa, decentralised finance enables anyone with an internet connection and compatible device — smartphones included — to engage in a variety of financial transactions, from sending remittances to making investments. Crypto investing allows Africans to purchase and hold assets that will not be impacted by financial turbulence, such as rapid depreciation and ever-increasing inflation.","As mentioned above, cryptocurrencies are typically cheaper, easier to use and faster than conventional methods. The blockchain technology that eases peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions exists outside established fiat currency institutions, supplying a far more accessible and user-friendly solution.","Traditional remittance services are often slow, expensive and largely inaccessible to a significant portion of the African population. Digital currencies allow for frictionless cross-border transactions, meaning that individuals can send and receive money globally in a matter of minutes. Not only does this benefit individual consumers, but it also empowers African businesses and entrepreneurs, easing economic growth in the process.","Given that Africa’s crypto ecosystem is still in an evolutionary stage, the popularity of decentralised currencies and blockchain applications will vary between countries and regions. Regulatory environments, infrastructure development and specific social-economic conditions can all influence the popularity and success of a crypto project. However, there’s no denying that the emergence of this industry has sparked a wave of innovation throughout many African countries.","Several blockchain-based startups have found innovative ways to leverage the potential of the technology to address the most prevalent socio-economic challenges. BitPesa is transforming the cross-border payments sector, while other startups have used blockchain tech to make supply chain management more transparent and even improve voting processes. By leapfrogging traditional infrastructures, decentralised currencies and technologies are proving to be the key to sustainable, long-term economic growth in Africa.","","","Cryptocurrencies have disrupted traditional financial systems in recent years, and Bitcoin profiled itself as the most famous crypto. It has already found its way to e-commerce and investment, but this crypto is also present in the world of online gaming. In this article, we will explore the growing influence of Bitcoin in the online gaming world.","Thanks to Bitcoin’s integration into online casinos, players and operators now have a vast range of possibilities. With the use of Bitcoin, online casinos create another level of advantage over traditional payment options. Most of all, if you perform transactions in Bitcoin, they will be quicker and more efficient.","You can deposit or withdraw the funds within seconds without the need for complex verification processes or intermediaries. This makes the gaming experience smoother and more seamless for any player. Additionally, Bitcoin offers a higher level of privacy and security. We have already experienced how much financial and personal information traditional payment methods require.","Nevertheless, unlike them, Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, which means they provide players with greater anonymity. This privacy feature particularly appeals to those who value their online security and wish to enjoy online gaming without revealing their identities. Integrating Bitcoin into online casinos has also resulted in innovative bonus structures and rewards.","Some Bitcoin casinos offer exclusive promotions and bonuses for players who use Bitcoin as their preferred payment method. The best Bitcoin casinos in the Philippines are safe to deposit at, according to this guide, and you can choose the one that appeals to you the most. That’s why more and more players turn to Bitcoin as their payment method, fostering its further adoption in the gaming industry.","Since Bitcoin is decentralized, transactions bypass the regular censorship and control that we can see involved with traditional payment methods. Thanks to this, players from regions with strict gambling regulations can participate in online gaming with fewer restrictions. Bitcoin-powered online casinos do not impose geographical limitations, opening their services to players worldwide.","Beyond online casinos, Bitcoin has made significant breakthroughs in esports betting. We could witness a skyrocketing rise of esports in recent years, which resulted in millions of enthusiasts and viewers worldwide. Thanks to Bitcoin’s integration into esports, players have a wider range of options to engage with their favorite games and gamers.","Esports, or competitive video gaming, has witnessed a meteoric rise in popularity, attracting millions of viewers and enthusiasts worldwide. Bitcoin’s integration into esports betting platforms has revolutionized how fans engage with their favorite games and players.","Bitcoin’s advantages, such as fast and secure transactions, align perfectly with the dynamic nature of esports betting. Users can easily deposit and withdraw funds, allowing for quick reactions to changing odds or game outcomes. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature also ensures that bettors from any location can participate, overcoming the obstacles of regional restrictions and currency exchange complications.","Moreover, Bitcoin’s integration into esports betting platforms has provided players with increased transparency and fairness. The technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, allows for unalterable and auditable records of transactions, ensuring that betting outcomes are tamper-proof.","This transparency has fostered greater trust among players, operators, and regulators, further fueling the growth of Bitcoin-powered esports betting.","As the gaming industry evolves, it has also opened innovative ways for gamers to enhance their gaming experience. With the involvement of Bitcoin, players can use it for in-game purchases. Nowadays, many popular online games support cryptocurrencies for item purchases, upgrades, or other enhancements.","Since crypto transactions are more seamless, Bitcoin has become a better alternative compared to traditional in-game payment methods. Game developers have also benefited from introducing Bitcoin as a payment option. Now they can offer a more convenient way of purchasing in-game items, transaction fees are lower, and processing times have become faster.","Moreover, you, as a player, don’t need to disclose any sensitive information anymore. That way, Bitcoin usage in gaming reduces the risk of potential data breaches. The adoption of Bitcoin in in-game purchases has also opened up new possibilities for cross-platform transactions.","As Bitcoin operates globally, players can easily trade or transfer in-game assets across different games or platforms, fostering a vibrant secondary market for virtual goods. This flexibility enhances player engagement and allows for a more interconnected gaming experience.","The integration of Bitcoin into in-game purchases has also paved the way for blockchain-based gaming ecosystems. Some game developers have embraced blockchain technology to create decentralized gaming platforms where players truly own their in-game assets through blockchain-based tokens. This ownership empowers players and introduces concepts of shortage and value to virtual items.","","Players can enjoy multiple benefits from using Bitcoin in online gaming. The most obvious one is that traditional payment methods cannot match the level of Bitcoin’s security and anonymity. Due to cryptos’ decentralized nature, you don’t need to disclose your sensitive data. If you want to get started in the gaming world easily and quickly, there’s no more attractive option than Bitcoin.","Transactions are completed within seconds, and they are cheaper in terms of fees compared to other popular methods. Since Bitcoin has become more popular in the online gaming industry, gaming platforms recognized its benefits.","Therefore, they introduced it as a payment method, and nowadays, the world’s most popular online gaming platforms accept Bitcoin, including Steam, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.","While Bitcoin offers many benefits for online gaming, such as fast and secure transactions, there are also some security considerations to keep in mind. Performing online financial transactions always brings a high risk of potential hacking and theft of Bitcoin wallets. That’s why you should use a secure and reputable digital wallet and keep your private keys safe and inaccessible to unauthorized persons.","Also, online gaming platforms that you use should have strong security features established to keep your financial and personal information away from the eyes of unauthorized third parties.","Bitcoin’s rise in online gaming has brought many benefits for all entities in this growing industry.

The first courses will take place in Cape Town, South Africa, and Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, in October of this year. The partnership will help close the gender gap in tech, which has continued to widen despite the blockchain market being expected to grow from $4.93 billion in 2021 to $200 billion by 2028.","“Binance believes the future of crypto should be built by all, not the few, so we’re creating certified courses and removing financial barriers for women, especially those from vulnerable communities, to study and train. It is important to us at Binance and Women-in-Tech that quality blockchain education, innovation, and research opportunities are within everyone’s reach,” said Helen Hai, VP of Binance and Head of Binance Charity.","Courses will be offered in classes of 25 to young women aged between 15 and 25 by qualified trainers both in person and online. The Web3 courses will be designed by Binance Academy and adapted to meet local context Courses, which will include: Blockchain Fundamentals, Crypto Fundamentals, Decentralization, Web3, and the Metaverse.","The South Africa pilot will take place in Cape Town at the Philippi Village Tech Hub in the Philipp Township for an additional 50 women. Over the duration of the six months, further programmes will be rolled out across Burundi, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, and Zambia.","Siya Kolisi, South African national rugby captain, will lead a two-year educational digital currency advertising in South Africa in partnership with Luno, a leading crypto exchange in South Africa.","The campaign’s rollout is expected to feature a series of television adverts that will promote a long-term investment attitude towards cryptocurrencies. Kolisi was front and centre of the first advert of the new campaign, which was aired during the Springboks’ third match of the Rugby Championship against Australia on Saturday.","In a statement highlighting Luno’s efforts in making crypto investing accessible to newbies that are unfamiliar with the space, Kolisi said, “Like many South Africans, I am new to crypto investment, so I had to do some research before deciding to partner with Luno. I love that Luno focuses on providing education for new crypto investors like me so we can make better, long-term financial decisions.”","Marius Reitz, Luno’s General Manager for Africa, highlighted the current downturn across cryptocurrencies markets as a prime example for investors to zoom out and focus on long-term investing in the space, “When you zoom out, the ups and downs do not change the fundamental potential of crypto to improve the world’s financial system, which is what its long-term value is based on. The long game in crypto means holding, rather than trading.”","Just over a month after the Central African Republic (CAR) launched the Sango Coin project that allowed foreign investors to purchase CAR citizenship by purchasing $60,000 worth of the coin, the Constitutional Court in the country has now ruled the move unconstitutional.","Despite the crypto winter, CAR’s government went ahead to launch the crypto project on July 25, 2022, amid backlash from various institutions, such as the World Bank, which distanced itself from the project. The court ruling, among other reasons, argued that nationality did not have a market and that residency required a physical stay in Central African Republic (CAR) as shown in a decree.","It is not immediately clear what the impact on the Sango Coin project will be over the coming days and weeks.","Crypto exchange Binance has, in a partnership with Inoni Tech, opened a training center in Cameroon’s capital, Yaoundé.","Cheta Nwatarali, a Binance Angel and an active member of Binance Africa, told BSC News, “With an average of 4.2% global crypto owners, Africa boasts 53 million crypto users, the second after Asia. Binance prioritizes educating about web three education and advancement in Africa through webinars, workshops, meet-ups, etc., which means they already know the drive to expand the crypto ecosystem starts from Africa.”","The educational hub that was launched on August 25, 2022, will act as a training centre for in-person blockchain and crypto education, up-to-date crypto news as well as host regular in-person events. In addition, the space will also offer resources and training for young people across Francophone Africa.","This latest move is part of Binance’s continued efforts to make cryptocurrencies more accessible in Francophone Africa and other parts of Africa.","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform that has partnered with UniPass to advance crypto adoption in Africa, and more.","Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform with a focus on gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and rewards, has announced the launch of the third version of its platform that features integration with UniPass, a non-custodial smart contract, enabling users to use their email addresses instead of seed phrases and gas.","The partnership will enable Cassava Network to onboard Africans from Web2 to Web3 as users will be able to create Cassava accounts and automatically sign up to UniPass where they will be able to send, receive, and store on-chain digital assets across various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains.","Speaking about the launch of the new platform version, Mouloukou Sanoh, Co-founder of Cassava Network, said, “Cassava v3 serves as a bridge for global Web3 businesses to connect with African Web2 users.”","Sanoh went ahead to mention that 90 percent of the partners engaging with the community feature of the new version are African businesses.","Benjamin Obenze, Cassava Network’s Business Developer, in an interview said that African users and businesses will be able to use the new platform version to enter Web3 spaces.","According to an analysis of Google searches done by Leverage Trading, Nigeria scored the second-highest globally (94) for searches related to crypto leverage in the last five years.","Singapore is the only country that outscored Nigeria with a score of 100 regarding searches but with more emphasis on transactional searches like ‘how to leverage trade crypto’.

The news was shared by Zambia’s Technology and Science Minister, Felix Mutati, on the ministry’s website in a move that is aimed at achieving an inclusive digital country.","Speaking about the news, Mutati stated that cryptocurrency is the future that the country desires to achieve,” but a policy framework is required to support this “revolutionary technology.” He went ahead to state that the testing of the technology that will potentially be used to regulate cryptocurrencies in the country will be upscaled in due time as part of deliberate efforts to achieve an inclusive digital economy in the country.","In addition, the minister also claimed that Zambia aspires to become a technology hub in Africa by developing digital infrastructure and attracting investments in the sector.","Momint, a South African startup, recently announced that it had launched a blockchain-powered solution that can alleviate the country’s energy distress by installing more rooftop solar systems in public institutions such as schools and hospitals.","The company has so far piloted the solution at one local school – Delmas High School – in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, according to a news report published by News 24. According to the report, investors who are keen to participate in the project can do so by acquiring non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are linked to solar cells and retail for just under $9.","The solar cells will then be leased to institutions that agree to buy the generated electricity through a standard power purchase agreement.","Speaking of his company’s solution, Ahren Posthumus, Momint’s CEO, said, “We are a technology company that’s trying to build for the next 15 years, but what we realized is we can’t build a technology company in a country that doesn’t have electricity.”","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about South Africa’s new clause on its advertising code targeted towards the cryptocurrency sector and more.","The South African Advertising Regulatory Board (ARB) has introduced a new clause targeted at the crypto industry and aimed at protecting consumers from unethical advertising.","According to the new clause introduced to Section III of the country’s advertising code, both companies and individuals in South Africa will be required to abide by certain advertising standards in relation to the provision of crypto products and services. The first clause makes it mandatory for adverts, including crypto offerings, to clearly express that crypto investments may result in the loss of capital given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. In addition, crypto adverts should not contradict warnings about potential investment losses that investors may face.","The clause also went ahead to emphasize that adverts for particular services and products must be explained in an easily understandable manner for the target audience. Advertisements must also have balanced messages around benefits, features, returns, and risks associated with the particular service or product.","Rates of returns, projections, or any kind of forecasts must also be sufficiently substantiated, including how they are calculated and what conditions apply to touted returns. Moreover, any information relating to a crypto product or service’s past performance will not be used to promise future performance or returns, and should, therefore, not be presented in a way that creates ‘a favourable impression of the advertised product or service.’","The clause went on to state that adverts from crypto service providers who aren’t registered credit providers should not push for the acquisition of digital currencies using credit. However, this does not prevent the advertising of associated payment methods provided by crypto service providers. In the same breadth, brand ambassadors and social media influencers will also be expected to comply with certain advertising standards, such as sharing factual information and not offering advice on investing or trading in crypto assets as well as the prohibition of promises of benefits or returns.","Central African Republic (CAR) has set up a 15-member committee that will be responsible for developing a bill on the use of cryptocurrencies and tokenization in the region.","Once developed, the legal framework will enable cryptocurrencies to operate in the Central African Republic and expedite the development of the country’s economy. CAR’s President, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, believes that digital currencies will help eliminate the country’s financial barriers and build a business-friendly environment that’s supported by a legal framework for crypto usage in the country.","He went on to say, “With access to cryptocurrencies, the monetary barriers existing until now will disappear, the main objective of the measures adopted by the government being the development of the national economy.”","The committee tasked with drafting the crypto bill comprises 15 experts from five different ministries of CAR, including the Ministry of Mines and Geology, the Ministry of Waters, Forest, Hunting and Fishing, the Ministry of Agriculture ad Rural Development, the Ministry of Town Planning, Land Reform, Towns and Housing and Ministry of Justice, Promotion of Human Rights and Good Governance.","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.",""],"create_date":"2022-09-02T06:01:18+00:00","tag":"","author":"Rachael Odhiambo"}

Matos was an “investor” in the now-defunct Bitconnect Coin.","Bitconnect was a cryptocurrency scam that went from obscure in 2016 at about US$ 0.17 to a high of $436 in 2017. It screamed of potential, becoming a top 20 cryptocurrency token. This couldn’t last, as the price came crashing to $0.40. Regulators came cracking down on the project, forcing its cessation in 2018.","","","If you logged in to the website, you’d find no whitepaper or clear team identification, but a promise of unusual profit. Through four phases of the project’s rollout, investors got a guarantee unlike any other in traditional investments such as stocks.","Phase one was the giveaway of 4.8 million Bitconnect coins to investors and the community. The second phase (first quarter of 2017) entailed the launch of BCC wallet and the desktop client to enable staking and mining BCC (Bitconnect coins). Phase three (second quarter of 2017) would be the launch of staking and mining. This meant 120% returns for investors per year! The fourth phase targeted introduction of the “Smart Card” and wider merchant adoption.","","Bitconnect is an excellent use case for newcomers to learn how crypto scams can operate.","The low daily return rate hooked on the old and young. Unsecured lending among traditional financial sector players had after all paved the way for the daily return concept not to seem too foreign. These numbers made far more sense if you put in more than US$ 10,000. You can see why Matos’ profit of $140,000 from an initial principal of $25,000 had many addicted to “the future of investing”. 2017’s cryptocurrency boom of bitcoin and other tokens further served to cement this thought with all manner of possibilities.","If the returns weren’t sufficient or attractive for you, Bitconnect provided a lucrative referral program with seven levels of earning commissions. It was an extra assurance of the profit structure. The bot would have to work overtime and compound profits to ensure everybody won. Put these together, and you have a catastrophe – a true castle in the clouds!","The charade collapsed when the law came calling. 2018 saw victims of the scam lose 30%, then 90% of their value to the insider cashouts with the closure of the Bitconnect exchange.","The Ponzi scheme came full circle with its promoters and their aggressive propaganda disappearing from any reasonable trace. Other exchanges delisted BCC, but the damage had been done. Bitconnect cited excuses on bad press, the Texas State Securities Board Cease and Desist order and DDos (distributed denial of service) attacks, yet the truth was out in the open: scammers won.","Matos disappeared, only to resurface recently taking a lot about weight loss through intermittent fasting. He’s trying to build repute in a different field, which is definitely better than the scam that made him famous.","About two decades ago, the mobile device was still at its nascent stage, and thus, a very small percentage of people owned a mobile device. However, years went by and ushered in the popularity of mobile devices. With this came the introduction of mobile betting apps.","These mobile apps are made for different industries. However, the betting industry is one area where mobile apps have made a significant impact. Today, brick-and-mortar betting houses have diminished in their numbers and are now being replaced by mobile apps.","In this article, we’ll analyze the impacts of mobile apps on betting and how they are changing sports betting.","","With the inception of mobile sports betting apps, many challenges were suddenly eased. For instance, sports betting has become more accessible as punters do not have to visit a physical betting house to place a bet on their preferred sports event.","Mobile betting apps have also seen significant growth in the number of people participating in sports betting. Also, more sporting options are open to individuals on the tip of their fingers. Today, you’ll find some of the best betting apps in South Africa (By Indran Naidoo) competing for market share.","Mobile apps for sports betting come with standout features that enhance the overall betting experience of individuals. Some of the unique features include:","Mobile betting apps allow players to bet on an ongoing match in real-time. This type of bet is known as an in-play bet. With it, you can bet on many market options, such as the next corner, who’ll score the next goal.","With mobile betting apps, you can cash out even before the game is over as long as your game is still in the running.","Mobile betting apps give you the ultimate privacy to bet on any game you want without someone looking over your shoulder. With your device, you can choose your market carefully within the comfort of your space and at your own pace.","Mobile betting apps offer players bonuses and promotions such as welcome bonuses, weekly bonus offers, and so on. There is also the tendency for some mobile betting apps to give players boosted odds.","Some mobile betting apps allow players to open a demo account. This demo account will be funded with fictional money, which you’ll use to bet on real-life games. The main distinction is that winnings on a demo account cannot be cashed out.","This helps players practice strategies or new markets without fearing losing valuable funds.","Mobile betting apps give players unlimited access to sports markets to bet on every minute of the day. You can be in your office, at a meeting, or even in the restroom and still have full access to markets to bet on.","","You can place many popular types of bets on a mobile app. Some of them include:","This is the type of bet where you choose an outright winner at the end of a match. Other aspects of the game are not considered in this sort of betting. The final score of the game is all that matters.","This type of bet occurs when a player plays multiple match selections in a single bet. Usually, this is done to improve the bet’s odds.","This type of betting is popular with football in particular. You can wager on the total number of goals that will be scored throughout a game. For instance, “over 1.5” simply means that a game will witness a total goal of more than one. On the other hand, “under 1.5” means that the total number of goals in a match won’t be more than one.","There are more options in mobile betting apps that are open to players to enjoy and win real money in the process.","There is no doubt that mobile betting apps have made a huge impact on the growth of the betting industry. It is safe to say that mobile betting apps have come to stay.","","Do you know that many predict that online gambling will depend on Crypto in the future? Of course, this makes a lot of sense since digital currencies have become a universal asset in recent years. By the way, we can also say that casinos have benefited greatly from cryptocurrencies.","Aside from the fact that the gambling scene has expanded horizons, it has also bragged of unimaginable game lovers in no time. From this, you should have known that there is still another reason behind these gaming assumptions. But you know what? Sit with us!","Let’s look at the major reasons digital currencies will be the future of the betting industry.","Today, cryptocurrencies serve as a way for players to make big bucks. Therefore, it is no longer news that the future of games is a digital currency. Thanks to cryptocurrency, the days when players had to make deposits to play their favorite games without a chance to win are over.","Moreover, digital currencies have continued to function as a major source of income for all punters. For example, it has a special way of rewarding players who have completed certain gaming tasks. These rewards are exceptionally offered by purchasing in-game items with in-game cryptocurrencies, contributing to crypto status.","With fast trading via cryptocurrencies, there is reason to believe that betting sites with local play payment options such as Neteller, Skrill, and bank transfers have little future. This is because it takes time to confirm these payment options.","Speaking of cryptocurrencies, you don’t have to wait long to receive payments. Your account will be credited in a blink of an eye. So tell us! Would you like to leave the crypto-based betting platform for the traditional betting platform? We are doubtful of that! Believe us, it’s coming to the stage where only cryptocurrency game forums exist.","Cryptocurrency eliminates the need to be able to play only in physical casinos. Consequently, it’s a bonus point for the development of online gambling. With this, players can easily access multiple casino games, like a huge catalog of bitcoin slots, and gamble anywhere without fear of being cut off from their betting experience.","Imagine depositing and withdrawing funds from anywhere in the world without restrictions. This means that instead of using other currencies, you can use cryptocurrency tokens to play games in any location. Besides, we all want a stress-free life, and cryptocurrencies have made things easier than we thought. Therefore, there is no upper limit; digital currencies thrive in the gambling market.","With the introduction of blockchain in the gambling industry, gamblers are much less likely to constantly fear being victims of data privacy breaches on gambling platforms. As far as we know, cryptocurrencies have the highest level of security to protect players from unforeseen circumstances.","Besides, you don’t have to reveal your financial and personal details on the gaming sites if you wish. That’s because, with crypto gambling, you can play anonymously and still have access to unlimited offers on the sites.","Of course, the technology behind casino games and digital currencies is practical, but you can’t deny that they fit like gloves. You can also buy and sell these digital assets for the benefit of gambling. So no doubt! Over time, the game world will become more eye-catching, and ultimately there will be no gambling forum without cryptocurrencies.","Bitcoin (BTC) has taken investors and the rest of the globe on a wild ride from its modest origins in 2008. The Bitcoin price fluctuated for over a decade, eventually reaching tens of thousands of dollars. Read on to learn about the history of Bitcoin.","Bitcoin is a decentralized electronic trade between individuals. In layman’s terms, individuals may transfer money to one another without going through a bank or intermediary. Bitcoin was created to facilitate financial transactions without dependence on the government or large financial institutions. Bitcoin users may deal with one another through the blockchain, which tracks transactions and the bitcoin price using a “proof-of-work” technique.","Some believe Bitcoin will someday replace fiat money. Despite Bitcoin’s shortcomings, venture investors remain hopeful about the progress in the Bitcoin price achieved since the cryptocurrency’s inception. The emergence of Bitcoin has gathered a group of individuals thrilled about the advent of cryptocurrencies and the possibilities they will provide for companies and investors. Furthermore, Bitcoin has spawned dozens of alternative digital currencies.","During the 2008 Great Recession, the role of banks in the financial sector was investigated. This was when Bitcoin was created, and a Bitcoin price was established. People claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper about the problems with centralized money management and the importance of trust when dealing with other people’s money.","Transaction costs can add up in the traditional financial system when a transaction can be undone or changed by a third party. The goal of bitcoin was to eliminate the need for a middleman in commercial transactions. Instead of depending on banks and other institutions outside the network to verify network integrity, the Bitcoin system employs cryptographic proof.","The first block was mined in 2009, marking the formal launch of the blockchain. A week on, the first test transaction was done. The only individuals who could obtain it for the first several months were miners who could check the Bitcoin price on the blockchain. Miners would exchange Bitcoins for no other purpose than to have fun. Miners are individuals who utilize very powerful computers to solve complicated mathematical problems to discover new Bitcoins and ensure that previous Bitcoin transactions are honest and accurate.","For another year, there weren’t any major transactions involving the new medium of exchange. Shortly thereafter, in 2010, a Florida resident offered some 10,000 BTC in a bid to have the priceless $25 commodity come home. His name was Pizza John. With this deal, the world had its first genuine Bitcoin prices set at some four Bitcoins for every penny. On average, this haul of Bitcoin compares to approximately $400 million in modern money. Interestingly, crypto enthusiasts have set aside May 22 to mark the groundbreaking occasion, known as “Pizza Day.”","","One feature that distinguishes Bitcoin price is its volatility. Because Bitcoin is a novel asset, there is a lot of speculation about it, and its value is widely discussed. Despite fluctuating prices, Bitcoin’s value has skyrocketed since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin’s history has been chiefly one of fast growth, punctuated by a few dramatic price declines here and there. Bitcoin surpassed the $1 milestone in February 2011.","Bitcoin price was less than $2 initially, but then it went up. It had its first bubble in June 2011, rising to above $31 before falling into the single-digit price range. After more than two years, Bitcoin finally reached $200 in April 2013. It was worth more than $1,000 by November of the same year. In November 2017, the fee was raised to $10,000. In November 2021, it reached a high of close to $68,990. That doesn’t mean the journey was without incident.","Bitcoin was called a bubble in 2017 because investors paid more for it than the Bitcoin price was worth. According to Furo, the 2017-2018 bubble was largely caused by an increase in initial coin offerings or ICOs. Some experienced investors compare the Bitcoin bubble to the end-of-the-century internet boom.","Everyone was talking about Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, a new network or protocol, from wealthy hedge fund investors to your neighbor. The ICO craze boosted the cryptocurrency market by billions of dollars. The beginning of 2018 saw a significant drop in the Bitcoin price due to psychological and technical issues. When the price of Bitcoin fell, a “mature market” developed around it.","Because of these changes in the Bitcoin price, the Bitcoin market has matured considerably. Established efficient and intelligent exchanges are taking the necessary steps to create a self-sustaining and viable market for investing and trading in Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and key institutional-grade participants are following suit.","Right now, the Bitcoin price is around $37,000. It’s far away from its all-time high and post-peak low. Earle claims that no one knows the inventor- Satoshi Nakamoto. This topic can be discussed, speculated, and may lead to conspiracy theories.","One of these theories holds that Bitcoin is a “skunk work” or top-secret project of a company like Alphabet Inc. or an intelligence service. Others believe it is a “trap-door project” that will be taken over by a bad person waiting in the wings. Earle considers Bitcoin’s present to be more important than its past. He argues that the predominant evidence points to two primary, widely held ideas. The first is: Like anything else, money is actually a good. Secondly, money results from a given market process.","Cryptocurrencies have almost wholly supplanted conventional money, but the Bitcoin price is still maturing, and Bitcoin is becoming a value store and unit of account.","So, what is the future of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency and the Bitcoin price? Nobody knows, but Furo believes it would be lovely and intriguing.","New, low-cost, and simple investment options are becoming a reality. The Bitcoin price will make acquiring bitcoins even more accessible to many individuals. Such access would be comparable to that of well-known markets. Keep in mind that no investment is without risk."],"create_date":"2021-01-25T06:04:58+00:00","tag":"","author":"Roselyne Wanjiru"}

Over the years, there have been significant developments in the NBA’s interaction with cryptocurrency. Let’s explore the influence of cryptocurrency on NBA odds and how it has affected the world of sports betting.","The influence of cryptocurrency on NBA odds has been an intriguing development in the world of sports betting. Cryptocurrency, with its decentralized and digital nature, has presented unique opportunities and challenges for NBA betting enthusiasts.","One aspect to consider is the volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The prices of these digital assets can experience rapid fluctuations due to various factors such as market sentiment, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. These price movements can directly impact the odds offered by sportsbooks for NBA games.","Crypto-related news and developments have also played a significant role in shaping NBA odds. Positive news, such as NBA teams embracing cryptocurrencies and forming partnerships with blockchain companies, can create a sense of optimism among bettors. These developments can potentially lead to more favorable odds for teams associated with crypto initiatives.","There have been instances where cryptocurrency fluctuations have influenced NBA games and their odds. For example, if a team associated with a crypto-focused sponsorship or partnership experiences a surge in popularity due to positive crypto-related news, the odds of that team winning might decrease, as more bettors may be inclined to place wagers on them. Conversely, if a team’s crypto partner faces significant negative developments, the odds might shift in favor of their opponents.","Cryptocurrency volatility can present opportunities for astute bettors to leverage these price movements in NBA betting. Some strategies that can be employed include:","To effectively leverage cryptocurrency volatility in NBA betting, understanding market sentiment and crypto trends is essential. Following reputable cryptocurrency news sources and staying updated on the latest developments can provide valuable insights into how the market might react and influence NBA odds.","Monitoring social media platforms and forums frequented by crypto enthusiasts can also offer insights into the prevailing sentiment and potential market movements.","Technical analysis, a commonly used approach in cryptocurrency trading, can also be applied to NBA betting to gain predictive insights. By analyzing historical data, identifying patterns, and utilizing indicators, bettors can make informed decisions on which teams to bet on. However, it’s important to note that technical analysis is not foolproof and should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis and research.","In recent years, the rise of crypto-focused NBA betting platforms has provided bettors with specialized options tailored to crypto-savvy individuals. These platforms offer unique features and advantages that cater to the growing demand for crypto-based betting in the NBA.","Specialized platforms catering to crypto-savvy bettors have emerged, offering NBA betting opportunities with cryptocurrency as the primary payment method. These platforms often provide a seamless and secure betting experience, ensuring transparency and efficiency in transactions.","Crypto-focused NBA betting platforms offer several unique features and advantages. Some of these include:","When considering crypto-focused betting sites, it is crucial to evaluate their reliability and security. Factors to consider include:","NBA players have embraced cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, leading to a synergistic connection between the league and the crypto space. This connection manifests in various ways, including player endorsements, investments, and partnerships.","In conclusion, the harnessing of cryptocurrency volatility in NBA betting has emerged as a captivating avenue for bettors seeking a winning edge. The influence of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum on NBA odds has introduced a new dimension to sports betting, combining the excitement of the NBA with the dynamic nature of digital currencies.","As the worlds of cryptocurrency and sports betting continue to evolve, the influence of cryptocurrency on NBA odds will likely grow in significance. Embracing this evolving landscape and harnessing the potential of cryptocurrency volatility can provide bettors with a competitive advantage in NBA betting, opening doors to exciting opportunities and potential rewards.","Cryptocurrency adoption is on the rise throughout Africa. According to Chainalysis, the African crypto market is one of the fastest growing in the world, with an estimated $20 billion worth of transactions taking place per month. Meanwhile Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are positioned in bitcoin.com top 10 global countries by Cryptocurrency Adoption.","In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the appeal of decentralised currencies in Africa and discuss how they’re leading the way in the continent’s ever-evolving finance landscape.","For several years now, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have been having a transformative effect on various industries and markets across the globe. From the disruption of the gaming industry via the emergence of play-to-earn gaming and online casino with crypto deposit platforms to smart contracts that are being used everywhere, from healthcare to real estate, the impact is evident.","With the rise of the DeFi and GameFi sectors, it’s clear that the global crypto era is now in full swing, and it’s an industry that’s gaining noticeable traction across Africa. Approximately 1.2 million Africans now actively trade cryptocurrencies, with Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa leading the way. Decentralised crypto trading platforms like Paxful and LocalBitcoins bypass financial institutions and present new opportunities for residents to buy and sell crypto tokens.","In terms of which crypto tokens are leading the way in Africa, Bitcoin (BTC) holds the position of the most dominant digital currency, with a substantial user base and trading volume. BTC is accepted and used for various purposes, including remittances and as a store of value.","Altcoins, too, are becoming more widespread in the continent, particularly Ether (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB). Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities have fuelled its growth in the region, providing a solution to developers for building DApps (decentralised applications) that address Africa-specific challenges.","Additionally, several homegrown cryptocurrencies have emerged in recent years that are tailored to the local needs of the region. The Akoin token (AKN), for example, was founded by musical artist and humanitarian Akon as a means of powering a digital financial ecosystem in those regions with limited access to traditional banking services.","Cryptocurrencies offer several unique advantages, which, coupled with the economic stagnation still present in the continent, makes them particularly appealing to Africans.","One of the key drivers behind the burgeoning popularity of crypto in Africa is the lack of access to traditional financial services that many Africans still face. Many residents stay either unbanked or underbanked, excluding them from taking part in the global economy.","Decentralised currencies are gaining increased acceptance among the financially marginalised, particularly the low-income population, who have often been excluded from the banking system or had to face disproportionally high transaction costs. By their very nature, cryptocurrencies remove the need for traditional intermediaries, instead offering a borderless alternative that enables individuals to send and receive secure financial transactions instantly.","Currencies in countries such as Kenya and Nigeria have been damaged by decades of inflation, contributing to a surge in both economic and political instability. Cryptos hold the power to remedy financial exclusion and present an alternative to weak domestic currencies.","Unlike the more established traditional banking options in Africa, decentralised finance enables anyone with an internet connection and compatible device — smartphones included — to engage in a variety of financial transactions, from sending remittances to making investments. Crypto investing allows Africans to purchase and hold assets that will not be impacted by financial turbulence, such as rapid depreciation and ever-increasing inflation.","As mentioned above, cryptocurrencies are typically cheaper, easier to use and faster than conventional methods. The blockchain technology that eases peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions exists outside established fiat currency institutions, supplying a far more accessible and user-friendly solution.","Traditional remittance services are often slow, expensive and largely inaccessible to a significant portion of the African population. Digital currencies allow for frictionless cross-border transactions, meaning that individuals can send and receive money globally in a matter of minutes. Not only does this benefit individual consumers, but it also empowers African businesses and entrepreneurs, easing economic growth in the process.","Given that Africa’s crypto ecosystem is still in an evolutionary stage, the popularity of decentralised currencies and blockchain applications will vary between countries and regions. Regulatory environments, infrastructure development and specific social-economic conditions can all influence the popularity and success of a crypto project. However, there’s no denying that the emergence of this industry has sparked a wave of innovation throughout many African countries.","Several blockchain-based startups have found innovative ways to leverage the potential of the technology to address the most prevalent socio-economic challenges. BitPesa is transforming the cross-border payments sector, while other startups have used blockchain tech to make supply chain management more transparent and even improve voting processes. By leapfrogging traditional infrastructures, decentralised currencies and technologies are proving to be the key to sustainable, long-term economic growth in Africa.","","","Cryptocurrencies have disrupted traditional financial systems in recent years, and Bitcoin profiled itself as the most famous crypto. It has already found its way to e-commerce and investment, but this crypto is also present in the world of online gaming. In this article, we will explore the growing influence of Bitcoin in the online gaming world.","Thanks to Bitcoin’s integration into online casinos, players and operators now have a vast range of possibilities. With the use of Bitcoin, online casinos create another level of advantage over traditional payment options. Most of all, if you perform transactions in Bitcoin, they will be quicker and more efficient.","You can deposit or withdraw the funds within seconds without the need for complex verification processes or intermediaries. This makes the gaming experience smoother and more seamless for any player. Additionally, Bitcoin offers a higher level of privacy and security. We have already experienced how much financial and personal information traditional payment methods require.","Nevertheless, unlike them, Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, which means they provide players with greater anonymity. This privacy feature particularly appeals to those who value their online security and wish to enjoy online gaming without revealing their identities. Integrating Bitcoin into online casinos has also resulted in innovative bonus structures and rewards.","Some Bitcoin casinos offer exclusive promotions and bonuses for players who use Bitcoin as their preferred payment method. The best Bitcoin casinos in the Philippines are safe to deposit at, according to this guide, and you can choose the one that appeals to you the most. That’s why more and more players turn to Bitcoin as their payment method, fostering its further adoption in the gaming industry.","Since Bitcoin is decentralized, transactions bypass the regular censorship and control that we can see involved with traditional payment methods. Thanks to this, players from regions with strict gambling regulations can participate in online gaming with fewer restrictions. Bitcoin-powered online casinos do not impose geographical limitations, opening their services to players worldwide.","Beyond online casinos, Bitcoin has made significant breakthroughs in esports betting. We could witness a skyrocketing rise of esports in recent years, which resulted in millions of enthusiasts and viewers worldwide. Thanks to Bitcoin’s integration into esports, players have a wider range of options to engage with their favorite games and gamers.","Esports, or competitive video gaming, has witnessed a meteoric rise in popularity, attracting millions of viewers and enthusiasts worldwide. Bitcoin’s integration into esports betting platforms has revolutionized how fans engage with their favorite games and players.","Bitcoin’s advantages, such as fast and secure transactions, align perfectly with the dynamic nature of esports betting. Users can easily deposit and withdraw funds, allowing for quick reactions to changing odds or game outcomes. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature also ensures that bettors from any location can participate, overcoming the obstacles of regional restrictions and currency exchange complications.","Moreover, Bitcoin’s integration into esports betting platforms has provided players with increased transparency and fairness. The technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, allows for unalterable and auditable records of transactions, ensuring that betting outcomes are tamper-proof.","This transparency has fostered greater trust among players, operators, and regulators, further fueling the growth of Bitcoin-powered esports betting.","As the gaming industry evolves, it has also opened innovative ways for gamers to enhance their gaming experience. With the involvement of Bitcoin, players can use it for in-game purchases. Nowadays, many popular online games support cryptocurrencies for item purchases, upgrades, or other enhancements.","Since crypto transactions are more seamless, Bitcoin has become a better alternative compared to traditional in-game payment methods. Game developers have also benefited from introducing Bitcoin as a payment option. Now they can offer a more convenient way of purchasing in-game items, transaction fees are lower, and processing times have become faster.","Moreover, you, as a player, don’t need to disclose any sensitive information anymore. That way, Bitcoin usage in gaming reduces the risk of potential data breaches. The adoption of Bitcoin in in-game purchases has also opened up new possibilities for cross-platform transactions.","As Bitcoin operates globally, players can easily trade or transfer in-game assets across different games or platforms, fostering a vibrant secondary market for virtual goods. This flexibility enhances player engagement and allows for a more interconnected gaming experience.","The integration of Bitcoin into in-game purchases has also paved the way for blockchain-based gaming ecosystems. Some game developers have embraced blockchain technology to create decentralized gaming platforms where players truly own their in-game assets through blockchain-based tokens. This ownership empowers players and introduces concepts of shortage and value to virtual items.","","Players can enjoy multiple benefits from using Bitcoin in online gaming. The most obvious one is that traditional payment methods cannot match the level of Bitcoin’s security and anonymity.

[…] We are hoping to show more Kenyans the wonders of bitcoin and take crypto adoption in the country to the next level.”","Furthermore, Paxful announced that it has registered more than 60,000 new Kenyan users in 2020. The company is also building a school in Machakos County and has set up handwashing stations in Kibera, the largest informal settlement in Africa.","“COVID-19 has dealt a huge blow to many people in Kenya and across the globe. Paxful is committed to reaching as many people as possible to help them better understand the opportunities presented by the crypto-economy. With this in mind, we have a new team in Kenya. The team will continue to learn from our Kenyan users and provide them with the best education and support,” said Paxful CEO Ray Youssef.","Blockchain startup, Electroneum, has expanded its electricity top-up service to four more African countries. These nations include Togo, Ivory Coast, Benin, and Sierra Leone. The in-app service is currently available in Senegal, Mali, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, and The Gambia.","“Electricity and mobile phone top-ups are a great way for people living and working away from their home countries to help friends and families by sending them airtime and data or by refilling their electricity meters,” stated Electroneum CEO Richard Ells.","Using the Electroneum app to top-up and send electricity, users can save time and money. Interestingly, Electroneum is the only company that facilitates electricity top-ups with crypto.","Akoin’s Kenyan partner, Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC), has launched the Akoin app according to an interview on Kenyan TV station K24. The app allows users to send and receive funds without any charges. Furthermore, it will eliminate the dependency on cash during the COVID-19 pandemic.","“Once the Akoin wallet [has funds, you can transfer the money to another] wallet as long as you are enlisted,” said MMTC CEO Dr. Maurice Simunyu. Furthermore, he explained that you can convert the akoin cryptocurrency to other currencies like USD and the KES. Currency conversion attracts zero fees.","The pilot stage roll-out of the akoin cryptocurrency, which is invite-only, will take place at MMTC. Moreover, it will be the main currency of use in the medical and technology city.","MMTC “is a US $2 billion sustainable metropolis centred around a state-of-the-art medical and technology complex.” The city is located in Butere, Western Kenya. It will have a shopping complex, a hospital, a private airport, and a golf course, among other developments. Also, the development is over 70 percent complete and has been operational since July 2019. The developers could complete the project this month.","“We just announced our partnership with Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC).

South Africa and Ghana follow Nigeria closely as both countries have also dominated Google searches for the term ‘trade crypto.’","Despite Nigeria leading in the crypto leverage searches and South Africa and Ghana following closely, Leverage Trading established that Africa still lags behind when it comes to searches for the term ‘stock leverage.’","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about the Senate initiating talks with the Central Bank of Kenya to develop policies on digital assets, Zambia’s move to test the tech it desires to use for crypto regulation, and more.","The Committee on Information, Communication & Technology, under the Senate of the Republic of Kenya, has made its intention known that it will engage the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and other stakeholders to develop policies on the use of crypto assets and virtual service providers in the country.","The news was shared on the official Twitter page of the Senate of Kenya. The committee is keen on facilitating the development of a crypto regulatory framework that can enable Kenyans to carry out safe and secure crypto transactions. Moreover, the committee also noted that having regulations on cryptocurrency use in the country will help Kenya to harness the benefits of financial innovation while curtailing the risks associated with digital assets. The committee also stated that it is committed to accelerating the implementation of the country’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).","Despite these new developments, the CBK hasn’t outrightly changed its stance on virtual currencies like Bitcoin not being a legal tender. However, the CBK, in 2022, published a discussion paper calling on Kenyans to share their opinions on CBDC as it looked to explore the potential implementation of a CBDC.","The Bank of Zambia and the country’s securities regulator are currently testing technology to allow for the regulation of cryptocurrencies. The news was shared by Zambia’s Technology and Science Minister, Felix Mutati, on the ministry’s website in a move that is aimed at achieving an inclusive digital country.","Speaking about the news, Mutati stated that cryptocurrency is the future that the country desires to achieve,” but a policy framework is required to support this “revolutionary technology.” He went ahead to state that the testing of the technology that will potentially be used to regulate cryptocurrencies in the country will be upscaled in due time as part of deliberate efforts to achieve an inclusive digital economy in the country.","In addition, the minister also claimed that Zambia aspires to become a technology hub in Africa by developing digital infrastructure and attracting investments in the sector.","Momint, a South African startup, recently announced that it had launched a blockchain-powered solution that can alleviate the country’s energy distress by installing more rooftop solar systems in public institutions such as schools and hospitals.","The company has so far piloted the solution at one local school – Delmas High School – in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, according to a news report published by News 24. According to the report, investors who are keen to participate in the project can do so by acquiring non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are linked to solar cells and retail for just under $9.","The solar cells will then be leased to institutions that agree to buy the generated electricity through a standard power purchase agreement.","Speaking of his company’s solution, Ahren Posthumus, Momint’s CEO, said, “We are a technology company that’s trying to build for the next 15 years, but what we realized is we can’t build a technology company in a country that doesn’t have electricity.”","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about South Africa’s new clause on its advertising code targeted towards the cryptocurrency sector and more.","The South African Advertising Regulatory Board (ARB) has introduced a new clause targeted at the crypto industry and aimed at protecting consumers from unethical advertising.","According to the new clause introduced to Section III of the country’s advertising code, both companies and individuals in South Africa will be required to abide by certain advertising standards in relation to the provision of crypto products and services. The first clause makes it mandatory for adverts, including crypto offerings, to clearly express that crypto investments may result in the loss of capital given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. In addition, crypto adverts should not contradict warnings about potential investment losses that investors may face.","The clause also went ahead to emphasize that adverts for particular services and products must be explained in an easily understandable manner for the target audience. Advertisements must also have balanced messages around benefits, features, returns, and risks associated with the particular service or product.","Rates of returns, projections, or any kind of forecasts must also be sufficiently substantiated, including how they are calculated and what conditions apply to touted returns. Moreover, any information relating to a crypto product or service’s past performance will not be used to promise future performance or returns, and should, therefore, not be presented in a way that creates ‘a favourable impression of the advertised product or service.’","The clause went on to state that adverts from crypto service providers who aren’t registered credit providers should not push for the acquisition of digital currencies using credit. However, this does not prevent the advertising of associated payment methods provided by crypto service providers. In the same breadth, brand ambassadors and social media influencers will also be expected to comply with certain advertising standards, such as sharing factual information and not offering advice on investing or trading in crypto assets as well as the prohibition of promises of benefits or returns.","Central African Republic (CAR) has set up a 15-member committee that will be responsible for developing a bill on the use of cryptocurrencies and tokenization in the region.","Once developed, the legal framework will enable cryptocurrencies to operate in the Central African Republic and expedite the development of the country’s economy.

The first courses will take place in Cape Town, South Africa, and Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, in October of this year. The partnership will help close the gender gap in tech, which has continued to widen despite the blockchain market being expected to grow from $4.93 billion in 2021 to $200 billion by 2028.","“Binance believes the future of crypto should be built by all, not the few, so we’re creating certified courses and removing financial barriers for women, especially those from vulnerable communities, to study and train.

I love that Luno focuses on providing education for new crypto investors like me so we can make better, long-term financial decisions.”","Marius Reitz, Luno’s General Manager for Africa, highlighted the current downturn across cryptocurrencies markets as a prime example for investors to zoom out and focus on long-term investing in the space, “When you zoom out, the ups and downs do not change the fundamental potential of crypto to improve the world’s financial system, which is what its long-term value is based on. The long game in crypto means holding, rather than trading.”","Just over a month after the Central African Republic (CAR) launched the Sango Coin project that allowed foreign investors to purchase CAR citizenship by purchasing $60,000 worth of the coin, the Constitutional Court in the country has now ruled the move unconstitutional.","Despite the crypto winter, CAR’s government went ahead to launch the crypto project on July 25, 2022, amid backlash from various institutions, such as the World Bank, which distanced itself from the project. The court ruling, among other reasons, argued that nationality did not have a market and that residency required a physical stay in Central African Republic (CAR) as shown in a decree.","It is not immediately clear what the impact on the Sango Coin project will be over the coming days and weeks.","Crypto exchange Binance has, in a partnership with Inoni Tech, opened a training center in Cameroon’s capital, Yaoundé.","Cheta Nwatarali, a Binance Angel and an active member of Binance Africa, told BSC News, “With an average of 4.2% global crypto owners, Africa boasts 53 million crypto users, the second after Asia. Binance prioritizes educating about web three education and advancement in Africa through webinars, workshops, meet-ups, etc., which means they already know the drive to expand the crypto ecosystem starts from Africa.”","The educational hub that was launched on August 25, 2022, will act as a training centre for in-person blockchain and crypto education, up-to-date crypto news as well as host regular in-person events.

The new digital currency will go live on the exchange on November 11.","Akoin is the cryptocurrency project founded by Akon, a Senegalese-American musician, whose vision in starting the project in 2017 was to fuel the dreams of entrepreneurs as they collaborate in their efforts towards Africa’s sustainable development.","Bittrex is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform, as measured by its transaction volumes, which average $41 million daily. The goal of listing the Akoin (AKN) token will be to provide an easily accessible and reliable currency alternative for Africa.","Akon has affirmed his commitment to building a city and economy that captures the spirit of a rising Afro nation through different milestones in partnerships and investments to bring universal utility to the Akoin token. He is keen on improving socio-economic opportunities for millions in Senegal who live in remote regions, lacking a reliable connection to the internet, and to the global digital economy.","The project addresses one of the key problem areas in African economies: weak and highly inflated currencies.","This is one of the greatest contributors to the well-known risk of investing in Africa. It also hinders seamless access to financial services for millions of citizens in African nations. Therefore, limiting an increase in the standard of living.","Akoin is a payment method for a marketplace powered by blockchain technology, designed to host a range of tools for entrepreneurs to network, collaborate, and scale their businesses in various African regions. The project is especially keen on creating a positive social impact in each of the communities.","Accessibility of cryptocurrencies is another problem area in Africa as there are varied regulations on the operability of crypto-related services in different nations. This has created a limitation on how many cryptocurrency exchange services are then available to citizens in various nations. However, this will change with increased education and adoption of cryptocurrencies or digital assets for purposes such as payments, crowdfunding, alternatives in credit, savings products, and insurance services.","Akoin will be a payment method in the Mwale Medical and Technology City in Western Kenya. The partnership enables payroll and exchanges through the upcoming Akoin Card, with a view of long-term holding.","There will also be Akoin Effect Opportunity hubs for young people to learn particularly about blockchain and AI while earning. Certainly, the listing of Akoin on Bittrex is a step in a thousand-mile journey.","The Akoin team has been particular about making the project for Africa and with a view of social impact. They are taking a unique approach to its deployment and engagement with the communities that will be using it in their daily transactions.","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform that has partnered with UniPass to advance crypto adoption in Africa, and more.","Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform with a focus on gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and rewards, has announced the launch of the third version of its platform that features integration with UniPass, a non-custodial smart contract, enabling users to use their email addresses instead of seed phrases and gas.","The partnership will enable Cassava Network to onboard Africans from Web2 to Web3 as users will be able to create Cassava accounts and automatically sign up to UniPass where they will be able to send, receive, and store on-chain digital assets across various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains.","Speaking about the launch of the new platform version, Mouloukou Sanoh, Co-founder of Cassava Network, said, “Cassava v3 serves as a bridge for global Web3 businesses to connect with African Web2 users.”","Sanoh went ahead to mention that 90 percent of the partners engaging with the community feature of the new version are African businesses.","Benjamin Obenze, Cassava Network’s Business Developer, in an interview said that African users and businesses will be able to use the new platform version to enter Web3 spaces.","According to an analysis of Google searches done by Leverage Trading, Nigeria scored the second-highest globally (94) for searches related to crypto leverage in the last five years.","Singapore is the only country that outscored Nigeria with a score of 100 regarding searches but with more emphasis on transactional searches like ‘how to leverage trade crypto’. South Africa and Ghana follow Nigeria closely as both countries have also dominated Google searches for the term ‘trade crypto.’","Despite Nigeria leading in the crypto leverage searches and South Africa and Ghana following closely, Leverage Trading established that Africa still lags behind when it comes to searches for the term ‘stock leverage.’","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about the Senate initiating talks with the Central Bank of Kenya to develop policies on digital assets, Zambia’s move to test the tech it desires to use for crypto regulation, and more.","The Committee on Information, Communication & Technology, under the Senate of the Republic of Kenya, has made its intention known that it will engage the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and other stakeholders to develop policies on the use of crypto assets and virtual service providers in the country.","The news was shared on the official Twitter page of the Senate of Kenya.

However, it appears as though Carry 1st will use its latest funding round to expand the capabilities of Pay1st, its monetization-as-a-service platform, which allows third-party publishers to make more money in Africa.","Carry 1st’s funding round was led by Bitkraft Ventures and saw additional participation from Andreessen Horowitz, commonly known as a16z. Alumni Ventures, Kepple Ventures, Konvoy, Lateral Capital, and TTV Capital also took part in the round. This funding round comes a year after the company raised $20 million in funding that a16 and Alphabet (Google’s parent company) supported.","Roqqu, a Nigerian crypto exchange, has been given a virtual currency license for the European Economic Area after two years of waiting for permission from regulatory authorities.","With the license, Roqqu will now be able to operate in 30 countries and expand its services within one of the world’s largest crypto markets. Roqqu plans to attract early traders keen on gaining an edge in the crypto sector by offering a better experience and competitive fees for newcomers. In addition, the company hopes to reach more than five million users in 2023, up from the 1.4 million users it has in Nigeria, which was the only country it operated in until it was awarded the license.","Traditional cross-border payment methods are known to take days, and this is what Roqqu seeks to solve. Benjamin Onmor, Roqqu’s CEO said, “It makes a lot of sense to solve this problem by using crypto as the vehicle. Crypto is a faster and cheaper route that can bridge the gap and help reduce fees for moving money globally. This is the core of the problem we want to solve.”","Roqqu plans to expand to other counties in Africa, with Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda being top of the list of countries it’s eyeing to expand into.","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform that has partnered with UniPass to advance crypto adoption in Africa, and more.","Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform with a focus on gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and rewards, has announced the launch of the third version of its platform that features integration with UniPass, a non-custodial smart contract, enabling users to use their email addresses instead of seed phrases and gas.","The partnership will enable Cassava Network to onboard Africans from Web2 to Web3 as users will be able to create Cassava accounts and automatically sign up to UniPass where they will be able to send, receive, and store on-chain digital assets across various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains.","Speaking about the launch of the new platform version, Mouloukou Sanoh, Co-founder of Cassava Network, said, “Cassava v3 serves as a bridge for global Web3 businesses to connect with African Web2 users.”","Sanoh went ahead to mention that 90 percent of the partners engaging with the community feature of the new version are African businesses.","Benjamin Obenze, Cassava Network’s Business Developer, in an interview said that African users and businesses will be able to use the new platform version to enter Web3 spaces.","According to an analysis of Google searches done by Leverage Trading, Nigeria scored the second-highest globally (94) for searches related to crypto leverage in the last five years.","Singapore is the only country that outscored Nigeria with a score of 100 regarding searches but with more emphasis on transactional searches like ‘how to leverage trade crypto’.

The acquisition strengthens Amber Group’s foothold in Hong Kong, a leading global financial center and one of the world’s most active and liquid securities markets, effectively widening the reach of the company’s products and services to legacy financial market participants.","“Hong Kong holds tremendous strategic value as a key global finance hub, and we are proud to be integrating the best from traditional and digital finance as we expand our presence in the market. As an asset management player with a decade-long track record, Celera Markets offers valuable market expertise and TradFi experience which is critical to our global mission to facilitate the convergence of TradFi and digital asset finance. This acquisition also marks a significant milestone in Amber Group’s commitment to regulatory compliance as we strive to build institutional investors’ trust and confidence in crypto assets. As we continue to hold ourselves to the highest compliance standards and win the trust of an SFC-approved institution, we look forward to welcoming a new era of finance in Hong Kong,“ said Michael Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Amber Group."],"create_date":"2023-01-20T17:24:13+00:00","tag":"","author":"Guest Contributor"}

This is in a bid to protect individuals while still not constraining innovation in the country.","Morocco’s Central Bank Governor, Abdellatif Jouahiri, already announced a series of discussions between BAM and various stakeholders in late December 2022 that will precede the implementation of the bill. The stakeholders targeted include regulators such as the Insurance Supervisory Authority, the Moroccan Capital Markets Authority (AMMC), and Social Security (ACAPS).","Jouahiri went on to add that the country’s Central Bank had collaborated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to develop the document. There are also earlier claims that Morocco had reached out to the Central Banks of France, Sweden, and Switzerland in a bid to study their regulatory experience with crypto assets.","The Nigerian Central Bank has announced plans to consider the development of a regulatory framework for the potential utilization of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and stablecoins.","The new plans to create a regulatory framework for ICOs and stablecoins were published in an 83-page strategy paper by the country’s Central Bank. The document went ahead to note that stablecoins have the potential to become a successful payment mechanism in the country. As for the ICOs, the report cites the need to have them regulated to prevent investors from making losses as it considers the potential that ICOs have when it comes to crowdfunding, fundraising for capital projects, or peer-to-peer lending.","The paper also discussed the eNaira, Nigeria’s CBDC, which was launched in October 2021. In the report, the Central Bank of Nigeria has stood its ground on the potential of the eNaira, terming it as an “enabler for transformation” for the country’s economy even as it looks to complete its implementation in the next three to five years.","The news around designing a regulatory framework for ICOs and stablecoins comes barely a month after the West African announced its plans to legalise cryptocurrency usage.","Block, Inc., a multinational technology conglomerate co-founded by former Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, is looking to partner with cryptocurrency companies in the African continent.","The news was shared by Thomas Templeton, who heads the company’s bitcoin mining business and self-custody wallet. Speaking on the collaboration, Templeton said, “Yes, we’re always looking for opportunities to partner. We know we can’t do it alone and we’re not going to build everything to that.”","Block, Inc. is interested in collaborating with companies that decentralise mining, be it physical mining or through the use of hardware or software. On the software side, Block, Inc. is keen to partner with companies offering on- and off-ramp solutions for buying and selling bitcoin. The multinational company has already made some investments in Africa, with the most recent investment being in Gridless’ $2 million seed round, where it led the round. Gridless is a Kenyan-based bitcoin mining company that helps to bring new energy generation to rural communities in the country.","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform that has partnered with UniPass to advance crypto adoption in Africa, and more.","Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform with a focus on gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and rewards, has announced the launch of the third version of its platform that features integration with UniPass, a non-custodial smart contract, enabling users to use their email addresses instead of seed phrases and gas.","The partnership will enable Cassava Network to onboard Africans from Web2 to Web3 as users will be able to create Cassava accounts and automatically sign up to UniPass where they will be able to send, receive, and store on-chain digital assets across various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains.","Speaking about the launch of the new platform version, Mouloukou Sanoh, Co-founder of Cassava Network, said, “Cassava v3 serves as a bridge for global Web3 businesses to connect with African Web2 users.”","Sanoh went ahead to mention that 90 percent of the partners engaging with the community feature of the new version are African businesses.","Benjamin Obenze, Cassava Network’s Business Developer, in an interview said that African users and businesses will be able to use the new platform version to enter Web3 spaces.","According to an analysis of Google searches done by Leverage Trading, Nigeria scored the second-highest globally (94) for searches related to crypto leverage in the last five years.","Singapore is the only country that outscored Nigeria with a score of 100 regarding searches but with more emphasis on transactional searches like ‘how to leverage trade crypto’. South Africa and Ghana follow Nigeria closely as both countries have also dominated Google searches for the term ‘trade crypto.’","Despite Nigeria leading in the crypto leverage searches and South Africa and Ghana following closely, Leverage Trading established that Africa still lags behind when it comes to searches for the term ‘stock leverage.’","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about the Senate initiating talks with the Central Bank of Kenya to develop policies on digital assets, Zambia’s move to test the tech it desires to use for crypto regulation, and more.","The Committee on Information, Communication & Technology, under the Senate of the Republic of Kenya, has made its intention known that it will engage the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and other stakeholders to develop policies on the use of crypto assets and virtual service providers in the country.","The news was shared on the official Twitter page of the Senate of Kenya.

Moreover, the committee also noted that having regulations on cryptocurrency use in the country will help Kenya to harness the benefits of financial innovation while curtailing the risks associated with digital assets. The committee also stated that it is committed to accelerating the implementation of the country’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).","Despite these new developments, the CBK hasn’t outrightly changed its stance on virtual currencies like Bitcoin not being a legal tender.

The expansion into Zambia will enable Zambians to buy and sell BTC and USD Coins using Kwachas, in addition to the 60+ crypto assets available on the exchange.","Established in 2018, VALR is the largest crypto exchange headquartered in the African continent. It also allows customers to safely buy, sell and store digital assets at some of the lowest fees globally. Since its inception, the platform has processed more than $10 billion of trades.","Speaking about the launch in Zambia, Farzam Ehsani, VALR’s Co-Founder and CEO, said, “As the largest crypto exchange headquartered in Africa, VALR is excited to now be serving the people of Zambia. We’ve built a world-class product with a focus on robust security, high performance, and regulatory compliance, and we look forward to welcoming the Zambian retail and institutional market to VALR.”","The expansion comes nearly nine months after the exchange raised $50 million in a Series B funding round that was backed by global investors such as Avon ventures. Currently, VALR is the only crypto exchange in Zambia that offers a full-service digital asset exchange, local currency order books, and a trading platform.","“VALR is committed to enabling the blockchain ecosystem in Africa, and working with other businesses to expand access to digital assets is an important part of the brand’s ambitious growth strategy,” said Blake Player, VALR’s Head of Business Development. “We welcome startups, mobile wallets, and other fintech to build on VALR and use our powerful API to create exciting products for their customers.”","A new survey conducted by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has established that central banks in Africa are interested in the central bank digital currency (CBDC) despite a few drawbacks.","While mobile money has been a great competitor to CBDC, 19 African central banks that responded to the survey have great faith in CBDC thanks to the fact that it can be used to implement monetary policies in Africa, unlike in other parts of the world. While all the 19 central banks that took part in the survey stated they were actively interested in CBDC, only Nigeria has so far launched a digital currency dubbed the eNaira. Ghana and South Africa are currently piloting a retail and wholesale CBDC, respectively.","One primary motivation that 48% of the central banks surveyed listed as a key reason why they would launch a CBDC in their respective countries was the provision of cash. This, they said, would save them money on not just the printing and storage but also on the transportation of banknotes and coins. All the survey respondents also believe that CBDCs would help them achieve financial inclusion.","Despite the positives, the surveyed central banks noted that some of the drawbacks in issuing a CBDC would include the availability and combinability of technologies, cybersecurity, high operational cost, functionalities, network resilience, and scalability.","Court papers and regulatory fillings from crypto exchange FTX and Alameda Research, its sister company, filed in a court in the United States have shown that the collapsed crypto exchange invested millions of dollars in at least two Kenyan startups.","According to the documents, FTX, through Alameda Research, invested money into Chipper Cash and Mara. FTX, through Alameda Research, participated in Chipper Cash’s 2021 Series C funding – among other investors – that saw the company raise $150 million for its expansion into Africa. Additionally, Alameda Research also took part in Mara’s seed round funding, where the startup was able to raise $23 million.","The collapse of FTX has gone down will billions of investor funds, leading other crypto firms to file for bankruptcy and further crippling the crypto industry, which has been experiencing a crypto winter since the beginning of 2022.","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform that has partnered with UniPass to advance crypto adoption in Africa, and more.","Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform with a focus on gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and rewards, has announced the launch of the third version of its platform that features integration with UniPass, a non-custodial smart contract, enabling users to use their email addresses instead of seed phrases and gas.","The partnership will enable Cassava Network to onboard Africans from Web2 to Web3 as users will be able to create Cassava accounts and automatically sign up to UniPass where they will be able to send, receive, and store on-chain digital assets across various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains.","Speaking about the launch of the new platform version, Mouloukou Sanoh, Co-founder of Cassava Network, said, “Cassava v3 serves as a bridge for global Web3 businesses to connect with African Web2 users.”","Sanoh went ahead to mention that 90 percent of the partners engaging with the community feature of the new version are African businesses.","Benjamin Obenze, Cassava Network’s Business Developer, in an interview said that African users and businesses will be able to use the new platform version to enter Web3 spaces.","According to an analysis of Google searches done by Leverage Trading, Nigeria scored the second-highest globally (94) for searches related to crypto leverage in the last five years.","Singapore is the only country that outscored Nigeria with a score of 100 regarding searches but with more emphasis on transactional searches like ‘how to leverage trade crypto’. South Africa and Ghana follow Nigeria closely as both countries have also dominated Google searches for the term ‘trade crypto.’","Despite Nigeria leading in the crypto leverage searches and South Africa and Ghana following closely, Leverage Trading established that Africa still lags behind when it comes to searches for the term ‘stock leverage.’","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about the Senate initiating talks with the Central Bank of Kenya to develop policies on digital assets, Zambia’s move to test the tech it desires to use for crypto regulation, and more.","The Committee on Information, Communication & Technology, under the Senate of the Republic of Kenya, has made its intention known that it will engage the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and other stakeholders to develop policies on the use of crypto assets and virtual service providers in the country.","The news was shared on the official Twitter page of the Senate of Kenya.

Crypsense Digital Group offers end-to-end solutions for the institutional adoption of blockchain and crypto assets in Africa.","“This is an amazing opportunity to accelerate Web 3 adoption in Africa through the programme and partnerships. We have so much untapped talent and potential within our continent in blockchain and Web 3. I am excited for Africa and I can’t wait to see where this opportunity takes us. We understand the potential that blockchain has in solving some of the challenges that are facing Africa and we believe that we can use our disruptive nature as a continent to create value for ourselves through the adoption of the technology,” said Alice Anangi, the Co-Founder and CEO of Crypsense Digital Group.","The 12-week programme is usually delivered globally to high-growth blockchain companies and is run by Draper University – a leading pre-accelerator and incubator in Silicon Valley that fosters growth of high-potential technology startups. The programme will provide the selected blockchain and Web 3 startups with the needed support to get all the industry mentorship and support necessary to scale their impactful solutions across the world.","Easy Crypto, a crypto exchange, has announced that it has partnered with Stitch, an instant EFT payments and financial data API for Africa, to enable its users in South Africa to purchase digital assets on the platform in minutes as well as to securely top up their wallets.","The partnership is expected to grow the accessibility of digital currencies to the general masses in the Southern African country. Customers will be able to securely link their bank account to the Easy Crypto platform and top up their wallets via Stitch’s instant EFT in just one click when they wish to buy crypto assets. Besides faster processing times, users will be able to process payments over the weekends, thus eliminating operational delays caused by traditional banks due to weekend closures.","Speaking on the partnership, Stitch Chief Executive Officer, Kiaan Pillay said, “At Stitch, we know that in the assets space, timing is critical. Through our LinkPay method, Easy Crypto customers can enjoy a secure, seamless, and fast payments experience whenever they buy crypto – without needing to wait through the weekend, and with far fewer instances of fraud. We’re excited to work with the Easy Crypto team to enable greater accessibility to the growing crypto assets space in South Africa.”","Yellow Card, a Nigerian crypto exchange, has launched a new feature dubbed Yellow Pay that will make it easier for users to transfer money between different countries in Africa.","The new service is also expected to open up the African continent to more investment opportunities, business grants, and access to credit, according to its Operations Director, Oparinde Babatunde. Yellow Pay was created to make it easier for users to send and receive money between African countries, as it’s often easier to send money from an African country to the United States than to send it to a neighbouring African country.","Speaking of the Yellow Pay launch, Babatunde said, “Yellow Pay simplifies money transfer between African countries by building a solution that understands the way Africans already interact with financial products. We’ve managed to simplify it further by reducing costs and waiting time of remittance across the continent drastically compared to traditional money transfer rails. With Yellow Pay, Africans can send money across borders using their phones.”","Although Yellow Pay is not a money remittance or foreign currency exchange service but an advanced crypto exchange product, it will utilize Yellow Card’s crypto exchange platform to complete the customer transactions in USDT.

According to Chainalysis, the African crypto market is one of the fastest growing in the world, with an estimated $20 billion worth of transactions taking place per month. Meanwhile Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are positioned in bitcoin.com top 10 global countries by Cryptocurrency Adoption.","In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the appeal of decentralised currencies in Africa and discuss how they’re leading the way in the continent’s ever-evolving finance landscape.","For several years now, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have been having a transformative effect on various industries and markets across the globe. From the disruption of the gaming industry via the emergence of play-to-earn gaming and online casino with crypto deposit platforms to smart contracts that are being used everywhere, from healthcare to real estate, the impact is evident.","With the rise of the DeFi and GameFi sectors, it’s clear that the global crypto era is now in full swing, and it’s an industry that’s gaining noticeable traction across Africa. Approximately 1.2 million Africans now actively trade cryptocurrencies, with Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa leading the way. Decentralised crypto trading platforms like Paxful and LocalBitcoins bypass financial institutions and present new opportunities for residents to buy and sell crypto tokens.","In terms of which crypto tokens are leading the way in Africa, Bitcoin (BTC) holds the position of the most dominant digital currency, with a substantial user base and trading volume. BTC is accepted and used for various purposes, including remittances and as a store of value.","Altcoins, too, are becoming more widespread in the continent, particularly Ether (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB). Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities have fuelled its growth in the region, providing a solution to developers for building DApps (decentralised applications) that address Africa-specific challenges.","Additionally, several homegrown cryptocurrencies have emerged in recent years that are tailored to the local needs of the region. The Akoin token (AKN), for example, was founded by musical artist and humanitarian Akon as a means of powering a digital financial ecosystem in those regions with limited access to traditional banking services.","Cryptocurrencies offer several unique advantages, which, coupled with the economic stagnation still present in the continent, makes them particularly appealing to Africans.","One of the key drivers behind the burgeoning popularity of crypto in Africa is the lack of access to traditional financial services that many Africans still face. Many residents stay either unbanked or underbanked, excluding them from taking part in the global economy.","Decentralised currencies are gaining increased acceptance among the financially marginalised, particularly the low-income population, who have often been excluded from the banking system or had to face disproportionally high transaction costs. By their very nature, cryptocurrencies remove the need for traditional intermediaries, instead offering a borderless alternative that enables individuals to send and receive secure financial transactions instantly.","Currencies in countries such as Kenya and Nigeria have been damaged by decades of inflation, contributing to a surge in both economic and political instability. Cryptos hold the power to remedy financial exclusion and present an alternative to weak domestic currencies.","Unlike the more established traditional banking options in Africa, decentralised finance enables anyone with an internet connection and compatible device — smartphones included — to engage in a variety of financial transactions, from sending remittances to making investments. Crypto investing allows Africans to purchase and hold assets that will not be impacted by financial turbulence, such as rapid depreciation and ever-increasing inflation.","As mentioned above, cryptocurrencies are typically cheaper, easier to use and faster than conventional methods. The blockchain technology that eases peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions exists outside established fiat currency institutions, supplying a far more accessible and user-friendly solution.","Traditional remittance services are often slow, expensive and largely inaccessible to a significant portion of the African population. Digital currencies allow for frictionless cross-border transactions, meaning that individuals can send and receive money globally in a matter of minutes. Not only does this benefit individual consumers, but it also empowers African businesses and entrepreneurs, easing economic growth in the process.","Given that Africa’s crypto ecosystem is still in an evolutionary stage, the popularity of decentralised currencies and blockchain applications will vary between countries and regions. Regulatory environments, infrastructure development and specific social-economic conditions can all influence the popularity and success of a crypto project. However, there’s no denying that the emergence of this industry has sparked a wave of innovation throughout many African countries.","Several blockchain-based startups have found innovative ways to leverage the potential of the technology to address the most prevalent socio-economic challenges. BitPesa is transforming the cross-border payments sector, while other startups have used blockchain tech to make supply chain management more transparent and even improve voting processes. By leapfrogging traditional infrastructures, decentralised currencies and technologies are proving to be the key to sustainable, long-term economic growth in Africa.","","","Cryptocurrencies have disrupted traditional financial systems in recent years, and Bitcoin profiled itself as the most famous crypto. It has already found its way to e-commerce and investment, but this crypto is also present in the world of online gaming. In this article, we will explore the growing influence of Bitcoin in the online gaming world.","Thanks to Bitcoin’s integration into online casinos, players and operators now have a vast range of possibilities. With the use of Bitcoin, online casinos create another level of advantage over traditional payment options. Most of all, if you perform transactions in Bitcoin, they will be quicker and more efficient.","You can deposit or withdraw the funds within seconds without the need for complex verification processes or intermediaries. This makes the gaming experience smoother and more seamless for any player. Additionally, Bitcoin offers a higher level of privacy and security. We have already experienced how much financial and personal information traditional payment methods require.","Nevertheless, unlike them, Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, which means they provide players with greater anonymity. This privacy feature particularly appeals to those who value their online security and wish to enjoy online gaming without revealing their identities. Integrating Bitcoin into online casinos has also resulted in innovative bonus structures and rewards.","Some Bitcoin casinos offer exclusive promotions and bonuses for players who use Bitcoin as their preferred payment method. The best Bitcoin casinos in the Philippines are safe to deposit at, according to this guide, and you can choose the one that appeals to you the most. That’s why more and more players turn to Bitcoin as their payment method, fostering its further adoption in the gaming industry.","Since Bitcoin is decentralized, transactions bypass the regular censorship and control that we can see involved with traditional payment methods. Thanks to this, players from regions with strict gambling regulations can participate in online gaming with fewer restrictions. Bitcoin-powered online casinos do not impose geographical limitations, opening their services to players worldwide.","Beyond online casinos, Bitcoin has made significant breakthroughs in esports betting. We could witness a skyrocketing rise of esports in recent years, which resulted in millions of enthusiasts and viewers worldwide. Thanks to Bitcoin’s integration into esports, players have a wider range of options to engage with their favorite games and gamers.","Esports, or competitive video gaming, has witnessed a meteoric rise in popularity, attracting millions of viewers and enthusiasts worldwide. Bitcoin’s integration into esports betting platforms has revolutionized how fans engage with their favorite games and players.","Bitcoin’s advantages, such as fast and secure transactions, align perfectly with the dynamic nature of esports betting. Users can easily deposit and withdraw funds, allowing for quick reactions to changing odds or game outcomes. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature also ensures that bettors from any location can participate, overcoming the obstacles of regional restrictions and currency exchange complications.","Moreover, Bitcoin’s integration into esports betting platforms has provided players with increased transparency and fairness. The technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, allows for unalterable and auditable records of transactions, ensuring that betting outcomes are tamper-proof.","This transparency has fostered greater trust among players, operators, and regulators, further fueling the growth of Bitcoin-powered esports betting.","As the gaming industry evolves, it has also opened innovative ways for gamers to enhance their gaming experience. With the involvement of Bitcoin, players can use it for in-game purchases. Nowadays, many popular online games support cryptocurrencies for item purchases, upgrades, or other enhancements.","Since crypto transactions are more seamless, Bitcoin has become a better alternative compared to traditional in-game payment methods. Game developers have also benefited from introducing Bitcoin as a payment option. Now they can offer a more convenient way of purchasing in-game items, transaction fees are lower, and processing times have become faster.","Moreover, you, as a player, don’t need to disclose any sensitive information anymore. That way, Bitcoin usage in gaming reduces the risk of potential data breaches. The adoption of Bitcoin in in-game purchases has also opened up new possibilities for cross-platform transactions.","As Bitcoin operates globally, players can easily trade or transfer in-game assets across different games or platforms, fostering a vibrant secondary market for virtual goods. This flexibility enhances player engagement and allows for a more interconnected gaming experience.","The integration of Bitcoin into in-game purchases has also paved the way for blockchain-based gaming ecosystems. Some game developers have embraced blockchain technology to create decentralized gaming platforms where players truly own their in-game assets through blockchain-based tokens. This ownership empowers players and introduces concepts of shortage and value to virtual items.","","Players can enjoy multiple benefits from using Bitcoin in online gaming. The most obvious one is that traditional payment methods cannot match the level of Bitcoin’s security and anonymity. Due to cryptos’ decentralized nature, you don’t need to disclose your sensitive data. If you want to get started in the gaming world easily and quickly, there’s no more attractive option than Bitcoin.","Transactions are completed within seconds, and they are cheaper in terms of fees compared to other popular methods. Since Bitcoin has become more popular in the online gaming industry, gaming platforms recognized its benefits.","Therefore, they introduced it as a payment method, and nowadays, the world’s most popular online gaming platforms accept Bitcoin, including Steam, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.","While Bitcoin offers many benefits for online gaming, such as fast and secure transactions, there are also some security considerations to keep in mind. Performing online financial transactions always brings a high risk of potential hacking and theft of Bitcoin wallets. That’s why you should use a secure and reputable digital wallet and keep your private keys safe and inaccessible to unauthorized persons.","Also, online gaming platforms that you use should have strong security features established to keep your financial and personal information away from the eyes of unauthorized third parties.","Bitcoin’s rise in online gaming has brought many benefits for all entities in this growing industry. From online casinos to esports betting and in-game purchases, Bitcoin’s unique characteristics have reshaped the gaming landscape, offering increased speed, privacy, security, and global accessibility. It shouldn’t take too long before cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance since they are continuously evolving.","That’s why we believe the Bitcoin integration in the online gaming industry will continue. Ultimately, it should unlock new ways of innovation and interaction for gaming fans worldwide, leading to limitless possibilities for the future of online gaming.","","","Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have made an impact on various industries, including the NBA. Over the years, there have been significant developments in the NBA’s interaction with cryptocurrency. Let’s explore the influence of cryptocurrency on NBA odds and how it has affected the world of sports betting.","The influence of cryptocurrency on NBA odds has been an intriguing development in the world of sports betting. Cryptocurrency, with its decentralized and digital nature, has presented unique opportunities and challenges for NBA betting enthusiasts.","One aspect to consider is the volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The prices of these digital assets can experience rapid fluctuations due to various factors such as market sentiment, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. These price movements can directly impact the odds offered by sportsbooks for NBA games.","Crypto-related news and developments have also played a significant role in shaping NBA odds. Positive news, such as NBA teams embracing cryptocurrencies and forming partnerships with blockchain companies, can create a sense of optimism among bettors. These developments can potentially lead to more favorable odds for teams associated with crypto initiatives.","There have been instances where cryptocurrency fluctuations have influenced NBA games and their odds. For example, if a team associated with a crypto-focused sponsorship or partnership experiences a surge in popularity due to positive crypto-related news, the odds of that team winning might decrease, as more bettors may be inclined to place wagers on them. Conversely, if a team’s crypto partner faces significant negative developments, the odds might shift in favor of their opponents.","Cryptocurrency volatility can present opportunities for astute bettors to leverage these price movements in NBA betting. Some strategies that can be employed include:","To effectively leverage cryptocurrency volatility in NBA betting, understanding market sentiment and crypto trends is essential. Following reputable cryptocurrency news sources and staying updated on the latest developments can provide valuable insights into how the market might react and influence NBA odds.","Monitoring social media platforms and forums frequented by crypto enthusiasts can also offer insights into the prevailing sentiment and potential market movements.","Technical analysis, a commonly used approach in cryptocurrency trading, can also be applied to NBA betting to gain predictive insights. By analyzing historical data, identifying patterns, and utilizing indicators, bettors can make informed decisions on which teams to bet on. However, it’s important to note that technical analysis is not foolproof and should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis and research.","In recent years, the rise of crypto-focused NBA betting platforms has provided bettors with specialized options tailored to crypto-savvy individuals. These platforms offer unique features and advantages that cater to the growing demand for crypto-based betting in the NBA.","Specialized platforms catering to crypto-savvy bettors have emerged, offering NBA betting opportunities with cryptocurrency as the primary payment method.

Some of these include:","When considering crypto-focused betting sites, it is crucial to evaluate their reliability and security. Factors to consider include:","NBA players have embraced cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, leading to a synergistic connection between the league and the crypto space.

According to Chainalysis, the African crypto market is one of the fastest growing in the world, with an estimated $20 billion worth of transactions taking place per month.

According to Chainalysis, the African crypto market is one of the fastest growing in the world, with an estimated $20 billion worth of transactions taking place per month. Meanwhile Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa are positioned in bitcoin.com top 10 global countries by Cryptocurrency Adoption.","In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the appeal of decentralised currencies in Africa and discuss how they’re leading the way in the continent’s ever-evolving finance landscape.","For several years now, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have been having a transformative effect on various industries and markets across the globe. From the disruption of the gaming industry via the emergence of play-to-earn gaming and online casino with crypto deposit platforms to smart contracts that are being used everywhere, from healthcare to real estate, the impact is evident.","With the rise of the DeFi and GameFi sectors, it’s clear that the global crypto era is now in full swing, and it’s an industry that’s gaining noticeable traction across Africa. Approximately 1.2 million Africans now actively trade cryptocurrencies, with Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa leading the way. Decentralised crypto trading platforms like Paxful and LocalBitcoins bypass financial institutions and present new opportunities for residents to buy and sell crypto tokens.","In terms of which crypto tokens are leading the way in Africa, Bitcoin (BTC) holds the position of the most dominant digital currency, with a substantial user base and trading volume. BTC is accepted and used for various purposes, including remittances and as a store of value.","Altcoins, too, are becoming more widespread in the continent, particularly Ether (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB). Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities have fuelled its growth in the region, providing a solution to developers for building DApps (decentralised applications) that address Africa-specific challenges.","Additionally, several homegrown cryptocurrencies have emerged in recent years that are tailored to the local needs of the region. The Akoin token (AKN), for example, was founded by musical artist and humanitarian Akon as a means of powering a digital financial ecosystem in those regions with limited access to traditional banking services.","Cryptocurrencies offer several unique advantages, which, coupled with the economic stagnation still present in the continent, makes them particularly appealing to Africans.","One of the key drivers behind the burgeoning popularity of crypto in Africa is the lack of access to traditional financial services that many Africans still face. Many residents stay either unbanked or underbanked, excluding them from taking part in the global economy.","Decentralised currencies are gaining increased acceptance among the financially marginalised, particularly the low-income population, who have often been excluded from the banking system or had to face disproportionally high transaction costs. By their very nature, cryptocurrencies remove the need for traditional intermediaries, instead offering a borderless alternative that enables individuals to send and receive secure financial transactions instantly.","Currencies in countries such as Kenya and Nigeria have been damaged by decades of inflation, contributing to a surge in both economic and political instability. Cryptos hold the power to remedy financial exclusion and present an alternative to weak domestic currencies.","Unlike the more established traditional banking options in Africa, decentralised finance enables anyone with an internet connection and compatible device — smartphones included — to engage in a variety of financial transactions, from sending remittances to making investments. Crypto investing allows Africans to purchase and hold assets that will not be impacted by financial turbulence, such as rapid depreciation and ever-increasing inflation.","As mentioned above, cryptocurrencies are typically cheaper, easier to use and faster than conventional methods. The blockchain technology that eases peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions exists outside established fiat currency institutions, supplying a far more accessible and user-friendly solution.","Traditional remittance services are often slow, expensive and largely inaccessible to a significant portion of the African population. Digital currencies allow for frictionless cross-border transactions, meaning that individuals can send and receive money globally in a matter of minutes. Not only does this benefit individual consumers, but it also empowers African businesses and entrepreneurs, easing economic growth in the process.","Given that Africa’s crypto ecosystem is still in an evolutionary stage, the popularity of decentralised currencies and blockchain applications will vary between countries and regions. Regulatory environments, infrastructure development and specific social-economic conditions can all influence the popularity and success of a crypto project. However, there’s no denying that the emergence of this industry has sparked a wave of innovation throughout many African countries.","Several blockchain-based startups have found innovative ways to leverage the potential of the technology to address the most prevalent socio-economic challenges. BitPesa is transforming the cross-border payments sector, while other startups have used blockchain tech to make supply chain management more transparent and even improve voting processes. By leapfrogging traditional infrastructures, decentralised currencies and technologies are proving to be the key to sustainable, long-term economic growth in Africa.","","","Cryptocurrencies have disrupted traditional financial systems in recent years, and Bitcoin profiled itself as the most famous crypto. It has already found its way to e-commerce and investment, but this crypto is also present in the world of online gaming. In this article, we will explore the growing influence of Bitcoin in the online gaming world.","Thanks to Bitcoin’s integration into online casinos, players and operators now have a vast range of possibilities. With the use of Bitcoin, online casinos create another level of advantage over traditional payment options. Most of all, if you perform transactions in Bitcoin, they will be quicker and more efficient.","You can deposit or withdraw the funds within seconds without the need for complex verification processes or intermediaries. This makes the gaming experience smoother and more seamless for any player. Additionally, Bitcoin offers a higher level of privacy and security. We have already experienced how much financial and personal information traditional payment methods require.","Nevertheless, unlike them, Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, which means they provide players with greater anonymity. This privacy feature particularly appeals to those who value their online security and wish to enjoy online gaming without revealing their identities. Integrating Bitcoin into online casinos has also resulted in innovative bonus structures and rewards.","Some Bitcoin casinos offer exclusive promotions and bonuses for players who use Bitcoin as their preferred payment method. The best Bitcoin casinos in the Philippines are safe to deposit at, according to this guide, and you can choose the one that appeals to you the most. That’s why more and more players turn to Bitcoin as their payment method, fostering its further adoption in the gaming industry.","Since Bitcoin is decentralized, transactions bypass the regular censorship and control that we can see involved with traditional payment methods.

Bitcoin-powered online casinos do not impose geographical limitations, opening their services to players worldwide.","Beyond online casinos, Bitcoin has made significant breakthroughs in esports betting.

By analyzing historical data, identifying patterns, and utilizing indicators, bettors can make informed decisions on which teams to bet on.

However, many new traders overlook the importance of considering their emotional responses and their risk tolerance when formulating their risk management plans. As a result, their plans crumble in the face of high-pressure situations.","As such, always consider your risk tolerance when developing a plan to mitigate trading risks. In fact, many trading consultants use it as a basis for forming your trading plan. By doing so, you can ensure that you are only taking on what you can handle emotionally as you work your way to reaching your financial goals. Over time, as you become more experienced and more in control of your emotional responses, you can decide to take on more risks.","One of the most effective ways to handle frantic feelings is to counter them with cold, harsh facts. Aside from your risk management plan, it is wise to conduct some research on your own that can substantiate or debunk any concerning news or rumors that might cause you to buy or sell on an impulse. For example, after hearing from another trader that one of the digital coins you invested in has died due to a lack of community support, you might be tempted to liquidate the entirety of your investment. However, after some digging, you determined that the community is still active and invested in improving said cryptocurrency.","It is also important to do your homework when picking which coins to support. Make sure to check the cryptocurrency’s whitepaper and the developers’ activities for a clearer idea of the coin’s potential. In this manner, you can feel assured that your investments have a high potential of bearing fruit in the future.","Many traders new to the crypto industry fall into the trap of obsessing over market charts. The constant flickering of colors and lights can be hypnotising to the unaware. They watch price fluctuations all day to ensure that they can take note of sudden price hikes and dips, which may lead down a path to profitable opportunities.","However, this method is not helpful to your mental and emotional health. Indeed, it can feel like an emotional rollercoaster watching prices go up and down continuously. Processing significant amounts of information for too long can wear you down over time and may instead cause you to decide poorly when an opportunity arrives. Thus, a word of advice: do not let the market chart take over you.","Signing into your crypto exchange after some time and learning that the value of your investment has plummeted is a reasonable fear for many traders. After all, it is not healthy to watch market charts like a hawk, and in the crypto space, so many things can happen after a short span of time. Fortunately, many crypto exchanges have stop-loss features. This is a feature that automatically sells your coins once their prices decline to a certain value. In this manner, you can feel assured that your investment remains intact, assuaging any fear or worry you may have while not on the crypto exchange.","Removing emotions from any decision-making process that you make is almost impossible. In a highly complex and volatile market like cryptocurrency, conquering your initial emotional responses and maintaining a clear head is a skill that you have to master through experience. By doing so, you can keep your eyes on the prize and trade in a manner that is most helpful to your needs."],"create_date":"2020-11-04T09:47:08+00:00","tag":"","author":"Angeline Mbogo"}

However, at the same time, investments at this stage maximize the profits.","UMI is one of the young projects created at the crossroad of DeFi and digital assets trends, which draws attention not only by its unique functionality but also by its future plans.","UMI is a universal monetary instrument that allows users to make instant, secure, and free financial transfers, as well as earn crypto through profitable staking. In addition, UMI is a full-fledged blockchain platform capable of executing smart contracts of any complexity.","Let’s take a closer look at UMI capabilities.","","The UMI network can execute approximately 4500 transactions per second. This significantly exceeds the capacity of most other blockchains, including fundamental ones like Bitcoin or Ethereum.","The UMI Mainnet was launched in the summer of 2020 and it’s continuously improving. In the future, the UMI team will roll out an update that will increase enough high capacity to execute 10,000 transactions per second. This brings the UMI platform closer to the transactional conductance of major payment systems such as VISA and MasterCard. The UMI developers also have a long-term goal – to achieve the capacity of 1 million transactions per second. Although this sounds too ambitious, there is a chance to reach it in the long run, and here is why.","First, the UMI network operates on an improved version of the Proof-of-Authority consensus (PoA consensus characteristics will be discussed in detail later in the article). Secondly, such scaling can be achieved through the optimization of programming languages and smart contracts, as well as with such tools as Kubernetes. Finally, upgrades of the UMI network can be carried out faster and with less effort with the planned changes in the internal architecture of the ecosystem.","Another planned function of the UMI ecosystem payment service also appears to be very promising: offline transactions. Other blockchain systems focus on transactions exclusively via the Internet, while in the UMI ecosystem, the procedure of sending transactions can be carried out without access to the World Wide Web using ordinary SMS or other communication methods. For example, the length of a UMI transaction is 150 bytes. That’s 1200 bits of information. The standard length of an SMS is 1120 bits (140 bytes), which means that only 2 SMS are required to send a transfer through the UMI blockchain. This is convenient if the transfer needs to be sent urgently, and the Internet is temporarily not accessible. Technically, the UMI ecosystem is already capable of sending offline transactions without the Internet connection, but the service for initiating transfers has not been launched yet. The UMI team is currently developing it.","Although, the main feature of the UMI blockchain is not the network’s capacity, but the absence of any fees. This has been achieved by the unique technology on which the ecosystem is built, as well as a different economic model in comparison to other popular cryptocurrencies.","","The UMI blockchain is based on Proof-of-Authority technology, a concept created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood.","The difference between PoA and the popular Proof-of-Work algorithms (which Bitcoin runs on) or Proof-of-Stake (Ethereum plans to switch to PoS) is that in the PoA network there is no place for contest between the miners and forgers for the right to generate a block and get a reward. The generation of blocks, and most importantly, their integration into the blockchain, is handled by trusted nodes – ‘master nodes’. In the UMI network, master nodes are large authorized nodes that meet stringent speed requirements. This feature significantly increases the network’s capacity.","However, the original concept of PoA also has its drawbacks. The original PoA model assumes that ordinary users cannot influence the operating mechanics of the system, and only trusted nodes have the right to confirm transactions and record them in the blockchain, and those usually belong to one organization or affiliated companies. These factors increase the risks of network centralization, which deprives the cryptocurrency of its main value – decentralization – and makes it little different from other already existing traditional payment systems. In order to avoid the risk of network centralization, the nodes in the UMI blockchain are divided into two types – ‘master nodes’, that integrate blocks into the blockchain, and ‘validator nodes’ that validate the blocks. Only certain types of nodes can become master nodes – they include nodes launched both by the UMI team and their numerous partners from different countries, while any user can launch a validator node. Validator nodes monitor the work of the master nodes, and if the suspicious actions are detected, the unscrupulous masters are automatically disconnected from the system.","Along with the distribution of power among master nodes and validator nodes, another mechanism that is designed to prevent centralization is planned to be implemented in the UMI system in the future – integration with Proof-of-Stake consensus. The UMI blockchain will continue to operate on the PoA algorithm, but if any problems with the master nodes arise, the system will automatically switch to the reserve PoS consensus. Even if all of the masternodes suddenly stop functioning, the performance of the UMI network and its ability to conduct transactions will not be affected. PoS nodes do not need computing equipment to work, a regular laptop is enough. Any UMI user who has installed a desktop wallet with a validator node will be able to launch a backup PoS node.","Moreover, staking works on a smart contract in the UMI system, which means that the staker does not need to keep the computer on all the time. Thanks to staking on a smart contract, you can generate new UMI coins: up to 40% per month in 24h mode.","With such a profitable economic model, UMI encourages users to actively join the system. This model is one of the features that allows UMI to avoid commissions for transfers – staking participants are interested in developing the ecosystem without additional incentives, such as commissions.","The UMI blockchain allows you to create many specialized multifunctional smart contracts, including those suitable for integration into e-commerce services or for launching decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These include various decentralized finance (DeFi) services.","Areas of application for the UMI blockchain smart contracts:","Thanks to its high capacity, the UMI network will ensure the smooth operation of large DeFi projects, decentralized exchanges (DEX) or decentralized applications (DApps), and users will not face unprecedented high transaction fees, as it happened before with the Ethereum network. Thus, the launch of UMI-based DeFi services will not have a negative impact on those who use the system exclusively for money transfers.","Currently, UMI coins can be mined in two staking structures (pools) – ROY Club and ISP Club. In order to start mining you need to create a personal wallet in the UMI blockchain and transfer a certain amount of UMI coins to your address.","After replenishing the wallet address, you can place your coins for staking in two pools. Unlike other staking systems, coins in the UMI system do not get frozen after joining a pool. They remain in the user’s wallet and no one can access them except the owner. Staking rewards accrue 24/7. The user can withdraw and sell them at any time.","You can buy UMI coins via the SIGEN.pro trading platform, which includes an exchange, an automatic exchanger, and a p2p platform. According to the statistics, the daily trading volume of UMI ranges from $ 250,000 to $ 300,000, and the liquidity of the order book for buying coins has already exceeded $ 3.2 million, taking into account the p2p-platform. For the project that was launched only four months ago, the numbers look very promising. The interest in UMI on the market is indirectly evidenced by the rapidly growing number of active users: their number exceeded 47,000.","Thanks to high-quality and fast mobile apps, users can perform all key operations using a smartphone or tablet. The applications for Android or iOS can be downloaded from Google Play and App Store, respectively.","UMI mobile apps offer a wide list of functions. One can create and manage one or several UMI wallets, receive and send coins, connect to staking structures, view the history of transactions, and get in touch with technical support.","The applications provide the ability to authorize using Face ID, fingerprint, or PIN-code.","You can find all the latest information about the UMI project in the blog.","Nigeria is ranked as Africa’s largest country with the most crypto traders and ranks third globally. The country accounts for the largest volume of cryptocurrency transactions outside the United States. In the last six months, it has been recorded that about 35% of the Nigerian population has traded cryptocurrency.","As encouraging as these numbers may be, Nigeria, as an environment, has been very unfriendly to cryptocurrency and its related aspects. Last year, the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all commercial banks and lenders to stop transactions or operations in cryptocurrencies, citing a significant threat to the country’s financial system.","The ban on cryptocurrency in Nigeria was big negativity to the Nigerian youth, especially knowing that over 50 million of the population are involved in cryptocurrency. During this time, a lot of crypto trading platforms were shut down in the country. Also, many bank accounts suspected of dealing with cryptocurrency were locked, including their funds.","Even today (as of May 27, 2022), any bank transaction with a description or notes of “crypto,” “bitcoin,” “P2P,” or any crypto-related words will be locked away alongside the account(s).","The unfriendly treatment of cryptocurrency in the country is alarming. In the plight of making a positive solution, the community led to adopting systems where crypto traders could trade cryptocurrency without involving the bank.","Today, finding the right crypto trading platform that works for you significantly can be frustrating. Many cryptocurrency exchanges came into existence to aid in safer cryptocurrency transactions in the country. In this plight, some fraudulent platforms were made in disguise to exploit money from crypto investors. How would Nigerian crypto traders know which platform is genuine or not? With some checklists for selecting the best crypto exchange in Nigeria, you will be given key guidelines on how to choose the best place to sell bitcoin in Nigeria.","A fast crypto transaction is important as the speed of cryptocurrency may block. Most times, transactions take hours to complete. Ideally, crypto transactions on regular crypto trading platforms take between 10 minutes to one hour. Surprisingly, some take over 5 hours. However, a few crypto transactions can take less than five minutes, depending on the app. In cases where we need transactions done quickly, or we accept crypto payments for your business, how do we intend to confirm payment before allowing customers to take their products? Should the customer wait for hours?","The speed of transactions has been a damaging factor for most Nigerian crypto traders. This has been a reason why many Nigerian companies find it difficult to accept cryptocurrency as payment options for their businesses.","Crypto transaction fees are another issue many Nigerians face. To really compare the best options for you, you have to look at the fees before and after conversion. What are the withdrawal fees, processing fees, and receiving fees,… These fees cause a huge discouragement in crypto trading in the country.","It is saddening that many Nigerian crypto traders cannot make transactions because many of these crypto trading apps have put some limits on how much they can withdraw, receive, buy or sell. This breaches the purpose of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency has made it easy for people to send money from one place to another without a barrier. Why should I not be able to receive my funds because it is below your limit for withdrawal?","Limitations have made many Nigerians lose interest in cryptocurrency or lose their cryptos.","These factors, alongside many others, have caused the trading of cryptocurrency in Nigeria very difficult.","Breet is an OTC crypto exchange platform that allows users and businesses who simply want to receive crypto and get a flat equivalent of their coin to convert their crypto to cash money immediately.","","With Breet’s over-the-counter system, you are saved from the hassle of boring explanations of what and how crypto works and tedious illustrations of cryptocurrency market charts. Breet enables users to securely convert and withdraw their crypto coin to cash money in less than five(5) minutes without the use of peer-to-peer trading or any third-party agent.","Breet is a revolutionary new way to convert and withdraw your crypto coin without the need for peer-to-peer trading or any third-party agent. With just one click, you can have cash money in hand within five minutes.","With Breet, you can sell your cryptocurrency in less than 5 minutes. This is an incredible feature on its own, meaning businesses can now accept cryptocurrencies as payment options without having their customers wait for hours to confirm payment.","Breet is also completely free. There are no hidden charges, no withdrawal fees, no processing fees and no receiving fees. There are zero charges with Breet. Breet’s free usage solves the issue of high and inconsistent charges for many Nigerian crypto traders.","","There is no limitation to how much you can receive or withdraw on Breet. You don’t have to have about 10,000 Naira worth of cryptocurrency before you can withdraw. You can even withdraw as low as 100 Naira with Breet Exchange.","Breet is simple, free and certified. There is not much sugar coating to tell before believing that Breet is, arguably, the best crypto trading platform in Nigeria currently. The incredible reviews on the Breet app give perfect evidence.","What more do you need? If not, a crypto exchange that makes crypto transactions easy and makes people happy. You should become a Breet user by downloading Breet mobile app available on all Android and iPhone devices.","Remember being a crypto trader in Nigeria can be challenging. This is why it is important for you to learn more about cryptocurrency and the latest news by doing your own research.","The much-anticipated transition of the Ethereum network from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus is finally taking place. The adaptation of PoS has always been the plan and a vital part of scaling Ethereum by future upgrades. However, abruptly shifting to PoS can pose significant technical and community challenges that are not as simple as using PoW to achieve network consensus. Having said that, what exactly are PoS and PoW?","Proof-of-work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm that allows for the secure, decentralised verification of transactions on a blockchain. In a PoW system, miners are responsible for verifying and committing transactions to the blockchain. During the verification process, miners compete against each other to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with cryptocurrency, and the transaction is added to the blockchain.","The Ethereum ecosystem has evolved at an astounding rate in the last year. This growth was primarily due to a significant emergence and explosion of NFTs and Decentralised Finance (DeFi) initiatives. While the change-over was imminent, some factors to be considered for the same are:","With so many downsides to its cap, PoW has many advantages, which is one of the main reasons it has been a reliable consensus for so long. The PoW consensus has been robust and secure all these years. But the consensus can be utilised by a cryptocurrency with a massive valuation and relatively simple use case, such as the bitcoin. With the amount of energy and power involved, it becomes difficult for individuals to meddle with a high valuation asset.","The consensus protocol Proof-of-stake (PoS) has been introduced to address the issue of over-mining. Proof of stake (PoS) is critical to understand because it could eventually replace the proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism that is currently used by most cryptocurrencies.","“PoS is a way to achieve decentralised consensus without using energy-intensive mining. It is an alternative to the more common proof of work algorithm. With PoS, a cryptocurrency’s blockchain is secured by its token holders who are required to lock up their tokens as stake and not by miners equipped with powerful hardware. It’s an energy-efficient, cost-effective and therefore, a popular choice for crypto giants like Ethereum,” states Dev Sharma, CEO of Blockwiz, a crypto marketing agency.","In contrast to PoW, in which the individual who completes the mathematical proof first is rewarded with new coins, with PoS, no new coins are created.","Proof-of-stake introduces several enhancements over the PoS mechanism:","Proof of stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm used by cryptocurrencies to determine who gets to create new blocks on the blockchain. PoS works by requiring users to lock up some of their currency in a smart contract called a stake. In return, they are given the right to validate blocks on the network and earn rewards.","The advantage of PoS is that it doesn’t require the massive energy consumption that PoW does. This non-dependency on massive energy utilisation makes it more environmentally friendly. It reduces the risk of centralisation since few users would be able to control the majority of the currency.

CoinMarketCap is the world’s most-referenced price-tracking website for crypto assets.","The listing has made Quidax the first fully African-owned crypto exchange to get listed on CoinMarketCap signifying a huge milestone for the crypto ecosystem in Africa. Quidax in a press release mentioned that the listing is a great way for people to not only get reliable information on their offerings but that it also helps showcase how important Africa is to the crypto ecosystem.","“This is a proud moment for us as it allows us to provide reliable information on our crypto markets to the millions of people that rely on Coinmarket’s data,” said Uzo Awili, Quidax co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO).","The news comes barely two months after the crypto exchange launched an updated crypto app that’s available for both Android and iOS users.","Data released by Luno on the crypto buying habits of South Africans has shown that the average crypto buyer from the country will be male and spends roughly R450 on their first purchase then HODLs onto it for close to eight months.","“South Africa is one of our strongest markets, in fact, South Africans make up about 43% of our verified customers. Over the past year, we verified more than 3 million new users worldwide. As we expand into new territories, the trend is starting to shift,” said Richard Ball, Lead Data Scientist at Luno.","According to the data, most South Africans will start buying crypto with a relatively small deposit, roughly R90 compared to their biggest local customers who start purchasing crypto at R1,500. The most popular crypto coins in South Africa are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP with more customers buying than selling. While more men are buying crypto than women in South Africa within the age bracket of 18-29, more women are active on Luno than men in the 60+ age bracket.","Additionally, on buying behaviour, Ball said that customers who bought during price surges tend to be more speculative compared to customers who bought when the market was flat and thus end up being long-term investors.","Basqet, an African Blockchain payments startup, has launched its cryptocurrency payment gateway that will enable businesses accept Bitcoin and other digital currencies as payment.","The startup launched its public beta and will be going live and has 118 businesses that have already signed up to start accepting crypto payments such as Bitcoin among others. Before launching the beta version, Basqet revealed that it had already transacted about $1.3 million with just a handful of businesses.","Speaking about the launch of the crypto payment gateway, Bunmi Eleshin, Senior Product Manager at Basqet said, “We are creating a missing link between people who hold cryptocurrency and businesses who want to accept crypto as a means of payment, and we are doing it without merchants having to experience a loss due to crypto’s price volatility.”","Merchants who sign up during the beta launch will be able to accept crypto payments in three ways – payment button, payment link, and Basqet API. Basqet also mentioned that with the beta launch, merchants will be able to accept cryptos such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and USDT with plans to add more over the coming weeks.","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform that has partnered with UniPass to advance crypto adoption in Africa, and more.","Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform with a focus on gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and rewards, has announced the launch of the third version of its platform that features integration with UniPass, a non-custodial smart contract, enabling users to use their email addresses instead of seed phrases and gas.","The partnership will enable Cassava Network to onboard Africans from Web2 to Web3 as users will be able to create Cassava accounts and automatically sign up to UniPass where they will be able to send, receive, and store on-chain digital assets across various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains.","Speaking about the launch of the new platform version, Mouloukou Sanoh, Co-founder of Cassava Network, said, “Cassava v3 serves as a bridge for global Web3 businesses to connect with African Web2 users.”","Sanoh went ahead to mention that 90 percent of the partners engaging with the community feature of the new version are African businesses.","Benjamin Obenze, Cassava Network’s Business Developer, in an interview said that African users and businesses will be able to use the new platform version to enter Web3 spaces.","According to an analysis of Google searches done by Leverage Trading, Nigeria scored the second-highest globally (94) for searches related to crypto leverage in the last five years.","Singapore is the only country that outscored Nigeria with a score of 100 regarding searches but with more emphasis on transactional searches like ‘how to leverage trade crypto’.

The committee is keen on facilitating the development of a crypto regulatory framework that can enable Kenyans to carry out safe and secure crypto transactions. Moreover, the committee also noted that having regulations on cryptocurrency use in the country will help Kenya to harness the benefits of financial innovation while curtailing the risks associated with digital assets. The committee also stated that it is committed to accelerating the implementation of the country’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).","Despite these new developments, the CBK hasn’t outrightly changed its stance on virtual currencies like Bitcoin not being a legal tender.

The news was shared by Zambia’s Technology and Science Minister, Felix Mutati, on the ministry’s website in a move that is aimed at achieving an inclusive digital country.","Speaking about the news, Mutati stated that cryptocurrency is the future that the country desires to achieve,” but a policy framework is required to support this “revolutionary technology.” He went ahead to state that the testing of the technology that will potentially be used to regulate cryptocurrencies in the country will be upscaled in due time as part of deliberate efforts to achieve an inclusive digital economy in the country.","In addition, the minister also claimed that Zambia aspires to become a technology hub in Africa by developing digital infrastructure and attracting investments in the sector.","Momint, a South African startup, recently announced that it had launched a blockchain-powered solution that can alleviate the country’s energy distress by installing more rooftop solar systems in public institutions such as schools and hospitals.","The company has so far piloted the solution at one local school – Delmas High School – in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, according to a news report published by News 24.

The startup is developing a Web3 user acquisition portal across Africa via a “learn, play, earn” and democratizing access to crypto-based income-generation opportunities.","As reported in TechCrunch, Jambo’s seed funding round was backed by major investors who have invested in prominent Web3 companies such as Avalanche, BlockFi, Dharma, and Polygon. The startup received funding from Alameda Research, AllianceDAO, Coinbase Ventures, DeFiance Capital, Delphi Ventures, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Tiger Global, Polygon Studios, and Yield Guild Games. Moreover, Jambo also received funding from various angel investors in the Web3 ecosystem.","Speaking about the investment, Santiago R. Santos, a Web3 investor and ex-ParaFi partner, said, “What WeChat did in China, Jambo will do in Africa. Excited to back this A+ team in becoming the Web3 super app of the continent.”","According to the founders, there is a big opportunity in Africa for Web3 and developing the app will help connect millions of African users to Web3 applications from across the globe. The company has already signed up over 12,000 students across 14 African countries to undertake a curated Web3 curriculum that will help them to explore opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi) and play-to-earn gaming.","Jambo is expected to release its beta version of the super app by Q2 and then go live in Q3 of 2022.","A microwork pilot study done in Kenya by Celo Foundation and Mercy Corps Ventures has shown how the incorporation of crypto payments could help Kenyan youth access digital jobs while reducing cross-border remittance charges.","Besides Celo Foundation and Mercy Corps Ventures, other partners included Celo, a mobile-first DeFi platform; Kotani Pay, a technology stack that enables blockchain protocols; Appen, a publicly-traded data company, and NairoBits, a Kenyan non-profit that uses ICT to empower disadvantaged youth. The pilot was carried out to show how blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies can help drive financial inclusion.","Speaking of the pilot project, Scott Onder, Mercy Corps Ventures Senior Managing Director, said “We trained 200 Kenyan youth to access digital microwork from global platforms using a mobile app and integrated Valora digital wallet, which is built on Celo. Our pilot tested how a stablecoin could reduce the costs and challenges of sending and receiving cross-border micropayments over a three-month period.”","In the trial, users were paid in Celo dollars (cUSD), – a Celo-native stablecoin that tracks the value of the US dollar – which they received a few seconds after completing the assigned tasks. The payments were then temporarily stored in Celo’s digital wallet known as Valora, after which participants could cash out at any time to their M-Pesa, an ease enabled to them by Kotani Pay’s off-ramp tech.","Currently, PayPal, Skrill, and Payoneer are the commonly used payment options for international online jobs. However, some of them tend to have higher charges for lower pay-outs as well as withholding payments with zero explanations. Mercy Corp Ventures believes that these challenges can be overcome using cryptocurrencies.","South African Amapiano Djs, Major League DJZ, with Soga World – a leading UK Web3 creative agency, on February 22, 2022, launched the world’s first Amapiano music non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Rarible.","The collection features 244 super exclusive NFTs that Major League DJZ created in collaboration with Ali Dawood. The 22 NFTs features 11 different editions of artwork based on the different countries that Major League DJZ have performed in including France, Nigeria, the UK, the US, Zimbabwe, and more. The artworks have been priced at 0.22 ETH. There will be an exclusive 1/1 piece with an unreleased track that will be exclusive to the NFT purchaser.","Additionally, the NFTs will also grant purchasers access to the invite-only Major League DJZ exclusive balcony mixes as well as access to their community where there will be opportunities to interact with the duo and various giveaways.","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform that has partnered with UniPass to advance crypto adoption in Africa, and more.","Cassava Network, an African Web3 platform with a focus on gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and rewards, has announced the launch of the third version of its platform that features integration with UniPass, a non-custodial smart contract, enabling users to use their email addresses instead of seed phrases and gas.","The partnership will enable Cassava Network to onboard Africans from Web2 to Web3 as users will be able to create Cassava accounts and automatically sign up to UniPass where they will be able to send, receive, and store on-chain digital assets across various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains.","Speaking about the launch of the new platform version, Mouloukou Sanoh, Co-founder of Cassava Network, said, “Cassava v3 serves as a bridge for global Web3 businesses to connect with African Web2 users.”","Sanoh went ahead to mention that 90 percent of the partners engaging with the community feature of the new version are African businesses.","Benjamin Obenze, Cassava Network’s Business Developer, in an interview said that African users and businesses will be able to use the new platform version to enter Web3 spaces.","According to an analysis of Google searches done by Leverage Trading, Nigeria scored the second-highest globally (94) for searches related to crypto leverage in the last five years.","Singapore is the only country that outscored Nigeria with a score of 100 regarding searches but with more emphasis on transactional searches like ‘how to leverage trade crypto’. South Africa and Ghana follow Nigeria closely as both countries have also dominated Google searches for the term ‘trade crypto.’","Despite Nigeria leading in the crypto leverage searches and South Africa and Ghana following closely, Leverage Trading established that Africa still lags behind when it comes to searches for the term ‘stock leverage.’","To learn more about Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Beginner’s Handbook for free.","","In this week’s news roundup, you will read about the Senate initiating talks with the Central Bank of Kenya to develop policies on digital assets, Zambia’s move to test the tech it desires to use for crypto regulation, and more.","The Committee on Information, Communication & Technology, under the Senate of the Republic of Kenya, has made its intention known that it will engage the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and other stakeholders to develop policies on the use of crypto assets and virtual service providers in the country.","The news was shared on the official Twitter page of the Senate of Kenya. The committee is keen on facilitating the development of a crypto regulatory framework that can enable Kenyans to carry out safe and secure crypto transactions. Moreover, the committee also noted that having regulations on cryptocurrency use in the country will help Kenya to harness the benefits of financial innovation while curtailing the risks associated with digital assets. The committee also stated that it is committed to accelerating the implementation of the country’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).","Despite these new developments, the CBK hasn’t outrightly changed its stance on virtual currencies like Bitcoin not being a legal tender.
