Barnard and Carrillo, who also founded Bitstop, built the first and largest private-label Bitcoin ATM platform based in Miami, FL with over 2,500+ Bitcoin ATMs worldwide. Genesis Coin and Bitstop represent over 75+ operators operating 12,000+ Bitcoin ATMs in the United States and international markets powering billions of dollars in annual sales volume.","As part of the acquisition, Andrew Barnard will become Chief Executive Officer and Doug Carrillo will become Chief Strategy Officer and both will join the Board of Directors of Genesis Coin. Evan Rose, Genesis Coin’s founder, will stay on as a technical advisor and remain a member of the company’s Board of Directors. The Genesis Coin headquarters will move to Miami, Florida.","“Genesis Coin gave birth to the Bitcoin ATM industry,” said Barnard. “It’s the first and largest Bitcoin ATM software platform in The World. Evan built a platform trusted by some of the largest Bitcoin ATM operators in our industry, both domestically and internationally, including the Chivo network in partnership with the Government of El Salvador.","Our industry is now rapidly changing and Genesis Coin will lead the way into the future. Accomplishing this requires a solid team of world-class visionaries and developers. At Bitstop, we built an incredible software team and platform which has partnered with some of the largest companies both private and publicly traded from the traditional ATM industry. We plan to bring our background and expertise in building the best technology and team in the Bitcoin ATM industry to Genesis Coin. We believe this is a win-win for all stakeholders,” furthered Barnard.","“Andrew, Doug, and I have been friends for a long time and have also been friendly competitors,” commented Rose. “They have a reputation for their innovative and creative thinking.

In turn, this has allowed them to attract and retain top-tier talent and build great products. This transaction represents the coming together of the two leading software platforms in the industry and creates value for both companies’ stakeholders. It combines the best product, engineering, and leadership teams in the space. I’m thrilled to work alongside them and look forward to introducing very exciting new products and services we have planned for this year,” commented Rose.","Barnard, Carrillo and Rose stressed the importance of continuing to provide stability to both platforms and continuing to service the needs of operators on both platforms.

Keiser refers to this potential event as the “God Candle,” suggesting a massive influx of capital could create an unprecedented spike.","While price predictions in the cryptocurrency world should always be taken with skepticism, Keiser’s forecast has sparked considerable interest in how such a Bitcoin surge would impact other cryptocurrencies.","In crypto terminology, a “God Candle” refers to a dramatic and sustained price increase for a cryptocurrency, often sparked by major events or shifts in market sentiment.","In this case, the predicted God Candle for Bitcoin investment is linked to the idea that institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds may soon significantly enter the market.","While it’s impossible to say with certainty which altcoins would benefit most from a Bitcoin surge, here are some notable projects worth keeping an eye on, along with reasons why they might see substantial gains:","Ethereum’s strong fundamentals and increasing adoption in the DeFi and NFT sectors make it a prime candidate for a significant price surge. Contrary to Bitcoin, known as a “decentralized currency,” Ethereum should be viewed as a distributed computing network.","With a market cap of over $362.2 billion, Ethereum stands out among the more than 26,000 crypto assets available today, contributing significantly to the total market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.","Solana’s fast transaction processing, low fees, and growing ecosystem of DeFi applications make it an attractive option for investors seeking a high-growth in cryptocurrency future.","Its recent price movements (about 587.1% in the past year) and market trends indicate it could experience a significant price surge driven by increasing adoption and demand.","XRP’s historical performance during similar market conditions, such as the 2017 cryptocurrency boom, suggests it could experience a massive price increase during this period.","Despite its slow market growth compared to other cryptocurrencies, its recent market movements and analyst predictions indicate it could be poised for a significant upward trajectory during this period.","Polkadot’s strong fundamentals, including its growing ecosystem of DeFi applications and its potential for significant adoption in the Web3 space, make it an attractive option for investors.","Its relatively low market capitalization compared to other major cryptocurrencies also increases its potential for significant price appreciation. According to Max Thake, co-founder of Peaq, there is a sustained demand for DOT from projects aiming to build on Polkadot.","Bottom Line","As the crypto market anticipates the potential of a “God Candle” event, getting the best opportunity can greatly maximize your gains.","Among the myriad of altcoins available, more seasoned investors are settling on RCO Finance (RCOF) as a standout option, citing “several compelling reasons.” It has a robust infrastructure that offers unprecedented opportunities, and it integrates AI technology that is becoming vital in trading crypto and stock.","For more information about the RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale:","Visit RCO Finance Presale","Join The RCO Finance Community","TheBitcoinNews.com – Bitcoin News source since June 2011 –","Virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to consumer protections.

Member of Parliament (MP) Rolando Brison has been outspoken for some time now about the benefits of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency for the people and the economy of his homeland. Today, he initiated the proposal of a law to designate TRON as the country’s blockchain infrastructure and TRON-based cryptocurrency as legal tender for everyday usage.","H.E. Justin Sun, founder of TRON, tweeted about the milestone:","“Another milestone for #TRON! St Maarten to adopt TRON as legal tender marks another achievement for our push [toward] worldwide blockchain adoption.”","Early last year, on March 19, 2022, Bitcoin.com News featured MP Rolando Brison, the leader of the United People’s Party and 2nd Vice Chairman of St. Maarten’s Parliament, when he announced “he’s become the first elected official to request his entire salary paid in bitcoin cash.” Brison has long believed and advocated for St. Maarten to become the “Crypto Capital of the Caribbean” by pioneering the integration of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency solutions.","The St. Martin News Network (SMNN) today highlighted MP Brison’s declaration to advance a law that would officially make TRON and TRON-based cryptocurrency part of St. Maarten’s local commerce and economic infrastructure. SMNN noted MP Brison’s intention not to “re-invent the wheel,” but rather to follow the example of St. Maarten’s southern neighbor Dominica. In October 2022, the Commonwealth of Dominica officially announced TRON as its national blockchain, following the passage of the Virtual Asset Business Legislation in May 2022, which the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank assisted in drafting. Dominica also at that time adopted seven TRON-based cryptocurrencies as legal tender. Brison is now working to translate “the law in a manner that fits our Dutch legal system and local economy,” SMNN reported.","According to their website, “The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) was established in October 1983. It is the Monetary Authority for a group of eight island economies namely Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.” St. Maarten, one of four countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, is also a member. The ECCB monetary union has a total Gross Domestic Product of nearly $10 billion USD.","“The ECCB legislation is a great framework for regulation that focuses on protecting the consumer, the economy, and ensuring that virtual asset oversight does not spiral out of control, without stagnating potential growth opportunities for the sector,” Brison said. Crypto is currently unregulated by the Central Bank of Curacao and St. Maarten. “Allowing cryptocurrency to continue totally unregulated in St. Maarten is extremely risky, and we have to be proactive. Hence I use my right of initiative to bring this law with TRON Protocol at the forefront, with possibilities later for other blockchains to be incorporated; this too can be done in line with other countries like St. Kitts, who I know are also working on their own legal tender legislation,” stated Brison, as quoted by the SMNN.","TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. The TRON ecosystem is striving to make decentralized financial solutions and stable currency accessible to every human on the planet. Brison feels that collaboration with TRON will connect St. Maarten’s economy with the fastest-growing DeFi ecosystem in the world, thus increasing the island’s attractiveness both for innovative entrepreneurs as well as international tourists.","Brison will formally engage St. Maarten’s legislative process in the coming weeks, in accordance with the constitutional right MPs have to initiate laws, with the hope that official adoption will soon follow.","About TRON DAO","TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.","Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of January 2023, it has over 138 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.7 billion total transactions, and over $11.0 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry – TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON’s official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens – TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.","TRONNetwork | TRONDAO | Twitter | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum","","Hayward Wong [email protected]"],"create_date":"2023-01-24T01:31:56+01:00","tag":"blockchain","author":"chainwire"}

Launching in two stages, Beta 0.3.0 introduces a variety of new features, as well as improvements and fixes of existing functionalities.","Starting on January 12th, 2023, Phase 1 was exclusively available for Primex Early Users, who could be the first to have a hands-on experience with Beta 0.3.0. From now on, Early Users will get privileged access to all major protocol updates in the future (beginning from Beta 0.3.0). In addition to the chance to test new releases before other community members, participants of the program also enjoy further benefits, such as direct communication with the Primex team and fellow Early Users via Discord, as well as the ability to participate in private challenges and earn exclusive prizes.","On January 18th, 2023, the Primex team will open access for the public to Beta 0.3.0, allowing anyone to launch the application and test the new release without restrictions.","Beta 0.3.0 introduces four new core features. As the first and the most important, Primex now deploys to two new blockchains: the Polygon Mumbai and Polygon zkEVM testnets. Consequently, users can now test Primex by trading and lending digital assets on DEXs across four different blockchains (Ethereum Goerli, zkSync 2.0 testnet, Polygon Mumbai, and Polygon zkEVM testnet). With the new multi-chain functionality, traders and lenders can now swap between different networks via a single interface.","“When we asked our community which chains we should deploy Primex on, Polygon was by far the top choice among voters. While we were happy about the results, they didn’t come as a surprise for our team. Mumbai is the testnet of Polygon PoS, the Layer 2 blockchain with the highest DeFi TVL that can achieve up to 7,000 TPS. On the other hand, zkEVM is a newer solution that uses ZK-rollups via the ultra-fast Polygon Zero technology to achieve a 90% fee reduction for users on Ethereum’s L2. For these reasons, it makes great sense to deploy Primex on the testnets of these two blockchains,” said Vlad Kostanda, Primex Finance’s Co-Founder.","Besides the above core features, the Primex team introduced additional changes to the protocol as part of the Beta 0.3.0 update, including:","About Primex Finance","Founded in 2021, Primex Finance is the first-ever cross-chain prime brokerage protocol that seeks to solve the DeFi market’s liquidity fragmentation issue by enabling spot margin trading backed by lenders across numerous DEXs and blockchains with a totally decentralized trade execution mechanism. In September 2022, the team advanced to the next stage of its roadmap by launching the platform’s Beta release.

Among these has","title":"The Best Altcoins For Top Crypto Narratives: AI, RWA, DePin, Gaming, And Crypto ETFs - The Bitcoin News","content":["In this bull market, the best-performing altcoins are emerging around rising narratives such as AI, DePin, RWA, Gaming, and Crypto ETFs. Among these has emerged a leader, ETFSwap (ETFS), which holds more promise than all the altcoins combined.","The gaming industry has seen tremendous growth in the last few years as altcoins leveraging this sector continue to pop up. To put this in perspective, this sector was worth around $9 billion in 2021. Fast forward three years, and it is currently valued at over $19 billion, thanks to positive gaming narratives.","Despite its growth so far, present narratives indicate that gaming could continue to grow to be worth over $50 billion by 2031. Gaming’s growth is just one example of how powerful narratives can be, showing the possibilities of other narratives.","Just like gaming, Crypto AI is enjoying a lot of positive narratives. Unlike other sectors of the crypto industry, AI tokens are strictly power-specific projects. Despite that, the rise of AI tools continues to position these digital assets in a positive light.","The integration of AI and blockchain is expected to deepen, potentially increasing the demand for AI-based crypto tokens. The leading altcoins in this space include Fetch.ai (FET), Render (RNDR), Golem (GLM), and The Graph (GRT).","These altcoins are already making waves thanks to their affiliation with AI projects. Market experts also predict that AI altcoins are set for more growth despite currently having only a $20 billion market cap.","Real World Assets (RWAs) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are two sectors currently receiving positive narratives in the crypto industry. RWAs are reshaping investment strategies within the evolving crypto narrative.","The RWA crypto market is still new but already worth around $8.5 billion, while companies like Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Centrifuge (CFG) lead this sector. Through their services, these platforms make investing in and trading real-world assets more accessible through blockchain technology.","Similarly, the DePIN narrative has gained substantial traction this year. Messari has listed DePIN as one of the Top 10 Trends in Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure in 2024. The cloud infrastructure services sector boasts a $5 trillion market cap in legacy markets, with DePIN representing just 0.1% of that value.","Messari emphasizes that DePIN’s storage solutions could address the growing storage demand driven by AI and Big Data companies. Trending tokens in this sector include Arweave (AR) and Hivemapper (HONEY).","ETFSwap (ETFS) has grown steadily to become not just the top project around narratives like RWA, but it has championed a whole new narrative: altcoins based on crypto ETFs. By being the first in this sector, the platform has secured the coveted first-mover advantage in what is expected to be a trillion-dollar sector.","The positive narrative surrounding ETFSwap (ETFS) is due to its unique features. This platform intends to bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi by tokenizing ETFs for trading on the blockchain for trading. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this platform tokenizes various ETFs, from crypto ETFs to Mining ETFs, to Commodities, among others, allowing crypto users to own and trade them easily.","This diversification helps users to adequately spread risk and broaden their investments. Additionally, it could lead to potentially huge returns across different investments as previously elusive yet lucrative traditional investments are making it to the blockchain for the first time.","Additionally, ETFSwap (ETFS) empowers flexible portfolio management, as well as an unprecedented two-way conversion. In simple terms, investors can convert any crypto asset into an ETF and back to cash or cryptocurrency. This is possible because the platform provides access to unlimited market liquidity, making real-time swaps and conversions possible.","A rigorous audit by the respected crypto firm Cyberscope has confirmed that the platform is a secure trading environment. Furthermore, it removes barriers to entry by eliminating the need for KYC verification during signup, allowing all investors to enjoy the offers of the platform.","To access the ETFSwap platform, users must hold its native ETFS token, which unlocks the entire ecosystem. This is why its presale has gone viral in the crypto community, selling out over 80 million tokens already. This surge has piqued the interest of numerous crypto investors actively pursuing sustainable investment opportunities.","The ETFS token is currently in stage 1 of its presale, selling tokens at $0.00854 each, presenting a golden investment opportunity. By stage 2, the price is expected to jump 100% to $0.01831, which makes this the best time to invest.","For more information about the ETFS Presale:","Visit ETFSwap Presale","Join The ETFSwap Community","TheBitcoinNews.com – Bitcoin News source since June 2011 –","Virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to consumer protections.

It doesn’t matter if it’s a bull market or a bear market – innovation doesn’t stop. We’ve always been focused on strengthening our resources to support our mission, with a more consolidated approach through Guild Hub,” stressed Ing.","Launched in late 2022, Guild Hub is BSPC’s initiative to help create legitimacy among Web3 communities by delivering an effective way of policing the community and providing a venue to create impactful and valuable partnerships. The Metasports acquisition will be instrumental in fostering further business growth, allowing BSPC to continue supporting the community.","“Esports and guilds are not going away as they are integral to Web3 gaming,” added Ing. “Metasports will be essential in serving these guilds.”","The acquisition of Metasports, with its proven capabilities in the gaming and content creator space, will further expand the opportunities for $GUILD token integration, solidifying BSPC’s position as a leader in providing comprehensive and user-friendly solutions for guilds and Web3 projects.","Metasports, which launched in December 2021, focuses on Web3 and Web2 gaming IPs across esports, creator networks, and news and media verticals. It has quickly proven its value in the Web3 space through the Lunacian Sports League (LSL), the first professionally organized and longest-running esports league for Axie Infinity, and the establishment of its Creator Business Management with renowned content creator KookooTV as the first partner.","While many veer away from high-risk decisions given the market conditions, the two companies view the acquisition as a strategic move based on a thorough understanding of the market, thanks to BSPC’s readily available and growing data sets through Guild Hub.","Joe Josue, CEO and Co-Founder of Metasports, is confident they can strengthen their commitment to enhance experiences around gaming and will bring value to their stakeholders through this acquisition.","“We saw an incredible opportunity to grow and invest in more IPs, and that’s when we started to seek venture. In BlockchainSpace, we found a partner that would be the backbone which we could build on Web3. By tapping BlockchainSpace’s infrastructure, we will finally be able to build technology-backed IPs, which is a powerful next step for us,” Josue shared.","With BSPC’s and Metasports’ sights set on scalability this year, both companies look forward to bringing in major changes that will not only impact their business development but contribute to the success and longevity of the growing global Web3 community.","About BlockchainSpace BlockchainSpace is the one-stop-shop for all guild needs that provides essential, scalable infrastructure, digital tools, financing solutions, and networking opportunities.

Investors included gjmp, DG Daiwa Ventures, Coincheck, and Ceres. Funding will be used to help build out Bunzz’s Smart Contract Hub, which is already used by more than 8,000 dApp developers. (Product page: https://bunzz.dev/ )","Bunzz has established a strong track record since its launch 11 months ago. Over 8,000 DApp developers have been using the platform, and more than 3,000 DApp projects have been deployed on-chain, making it one of the largest DApp development infrastructures in Asia.","The platform has been recognized by top-tier landmarks as a major infrastructure service in the smart contract development sector. It has been featured on the web3 development infrastructure chaos map published by Coinbase. Additionally, Bunzz was also a finalist in Icetea Lab, Singapore’s largest web3 accelerator program.","","Currently, engineers who can handle DApp development are very rare. The reason is that the barrier to developing smart contracts, which are web3-specific programs, is high. In other words, if web2 software engineers could handle contract development, it would be much easier to enter the web3 space.","Bunzz has succeeded in simplifying the previously complex development process by providing frequently used contracts as modules and wrapping the preparation of nodes and the launch of the development environment.","About Bunzz’s core feature “Smart Contract Hub”","Bunzz offers a modularized version of frequently used smart contracts. These are freely available to general users and can be reused by other DApp developers.","On the other hand, there is a similar service called Open Zeppelin, an open-source library. The difference between this and Bunzz is convenience. While OZ’s code is just a library and cannot be deployed right away as it requires a development environment and nodes, Bunzz’s modules can be deployed with just a GUI. It is truly the “web3 version of Docker Hub”.","Partial list of smart contract modules offered by Bunzz","NFT related modules:","DeFi related modules:","Kenta Akutsu, CEO & Co-Founder of Bunzz, explained: “Bunzz ultimately aims to become web3’s equivalent to Docker Hub. Immutable smart contracts on the blockchain are open programs, also called ‘public goods,’ because anyone can access and use them without permission. However, the usage flow and the logic of their operation are difficult to understand, making it inconvenient for engineers who want to reuse them.

Gaming is one such industry. Web3 in gaming may be considered the beginning of this journey now that we are on the verge of welcoming the future with web3.","Web3 games are technically digital games that store data and conduct transactions using blockchain technology.

This drop has shifted investor","title":"Avalanche (AVAX) Signals Potential 25% Price Surge – Here\u0027s the Reason - The Bitcoin News","content":["Avalanche (AVAX) experienced a downward slide after weeks of hovering near the lower boundary of its rising price channel. This drop has shifted investor focus toward reclaiming this crucial level as support, with an eye on a potential rebound.","Main question is, what’s next for AVAX, it’s price and the blockchain? We try to decode, unravel and investigate.","Despite the recent price dip, Avalanche’s long-term holders are increasing their stakes, indicating a potential turnaround. Recent data shows that more AVAX has moved from short- and medium-term holders to those who hold for a year or longer, indicating growing confidence in the asset’s future.","Over the last three weeks, these long-term investors have added about 4% of AVAX’s circulating supply, totaling 4.2 million coins valued at $161 million. This brings their collective holdings to 20.72 million AVAX, demonstrating that these investors are optimistic about the price recovering despite the bearish trend.","The broader market also shows signs of optimism. Technical indicators like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reveal a positive trend. This tool, which identifies shifts in momentum and potential reversals, shows a bullish crossover on its histogram—the first such occurrence in a month—suggesting a possible upward move in the near future.","Right now, AVAX is approaching a critical resistance level at $40. If it breaks through, the next barrier is at $44 or even $50. This upward trajectory would represent a 20.31% increase from current levels, indicating a strong recovery if the market continues to support the asset.","However, if AVAX fails to break through the $44 resistance, it could retrace to $33. Further losses could lead to a drop to $29 or even $27, undermining any bullish progress. Avalanche’s token AVAX is currently priced at $38.90 on Gate.io.","Investors and market observers will watch these key levels to gauge whether AVAX can sustain a rally or if it will face additional headwinds.","Avalanche (AVAX) is a blockchain platform designed to support decentralized applications (dApps), customizable blockchains, and other blockchain-based systems. Launched by Ava Labs in 2020, Avalanche aims to provide a scalable, flexible, and interoperable framework for developers, allowing them to create and deploy innovative solutions across various industries.","Avalanche stands out for its use of a novel consensus protocol, also named Avalanche, which is designed to achieve fast transaction finality with low energy consumption. This consensus mechanism allows the network to process thousands of transactions per second, providing high throughput while maintaining security and decentralization. As a result, Avalanche can accommodate a wide range of applications, from simple peer-to-peer transactions to complex DeFi (decentralized finance) platforms and beyond.","A key feature of Avalanche is its customizable subnets. A subnet is a dynamic set of validators that work together to achieve consensus on a specific blockchain within the Avalanche ecosystem. This architecture allows developers to create customized blockchains with their own consensus rules and governance structures. It also facilitates interoperability between different blockchains, enabling seamless communication and asset transfers.","AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche platform, plays multiple roles within the ecosystem. It is used to pay for transaction fees, incentivize validators, and participate in governance decisions. AVAX also acts as a unit of account and a medium for value exchange, contributing to the platform’s economic security.","Avalanche’s ultimate goal is to create a decentralized network that can support a wide range of applications and use cases while maintaining high performance and scalability. By enabling developers to build custom blockchains and interact with other networks, Avalanche seeks to foster a vibrant ecosystem where innovation can flourish. The platform’s flexible design and efficient consensus mechanism make it a compelling choice for projects that require speed, scalability, and security.","Avalanche (AVAX) operates in a competitive landscape, where several other blockchain platforms share similar goals of scalability, speed, and interoperability. Below are a few key competitors and how they compare to Avalanche:","Ethereum is one of the most well-known blockchain platforms and a significant competitor to Avalanche. As the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum has a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, Ethereum has faced scalability issues due to its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, leading to high transaction fees and network congestion. Ethereum 2.0, transitioning to proof-of-stake (PoS), aims to address these concerns, but the rollout has been gradual. Avalanche’s consensus protocol, offering high throughput and quick finality, positions it as an attractive alternative for developers seeking scalability.","Polkadot, developed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, focuses on interoperability and multichain capabilities, similar to Avalanche’s customizable subnets. Polkadot’s Relay Chain serves as the backbone, allowing different blockchains, known as parachains, to connect and communicate. This approach creates a diverse ecosystem where various chains can coexist and share information. While Polkadot emphasizes interoperability, Avalanche’s subnets allow for greater customization and flexibility, making both platforms appealing to developers with specific needs.","Solana is a high-performance blockchain that emphasizes speed and low transaction costs, using a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH). Solana has gained popularity for its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second, attracting projects in DeFi, NFTs, and other domains. While Solana’s speed and efficiency are noteworthy, Avalanche’s consensus protocol balances performance with energy efficiency, potentially offering a more environmentally friendly solution. Avalanche’s focus on customizable blockchains also sets it apart from Solana’s single-layer approach.","TheBitcoinNews.com – Bitcoin News source since June 2011 –","Virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to consumer protections.

Member of Parliament (MP) Rolando Brison has been outspoken for some time now about the benefits of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency for the people and the economy of his homeland. Today, he initiated the proposal of a law to designate TRON as the country’s blockchain infrastructure and TRON-based cryptocurrency as legal tender for everyday usage.","H.E. Justin Sun, founder of TRON, tweeted about the milestone:","“Another milestone for #TRON! St Maarten to adopt TRON as legal tender marks another achievement for our push [toward] worldwide blockchain adoption.”","Early last year, on March 19, 2022, Bitcoin.com News featured MP Rolando Brison, the leader of the United People’s Party and 2nd Vice Chairman of St. Maarten’s Parliament, when he announced “he’s become the first elected official to request his entire salary paid in bitcoin cash.” Brison has long believed and advocated for St. Maarten to become the “Crypto Capital of the Caribbean” by pioneering the integration of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency solutions.","The St. Martin News Network (SMNN) today highlighted MP Brison’s declaration to advance a law that would officially make TRON and TRON-based cryptocurrency part of St. Maarten’s local commerce and economic infrastructure. SMNN noted MP Brison’s intention not to “re-invent the wheel,” but rather to follow the example of St. Maarten’s southern neighbor Dominica. In October 2022, the Commonwealth of Dominica officially announced TRON as its national blockchain, following the passage of the Virtual Asset Business Legislation in May 2022, which the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank assisted in drafting. Dominica also at that time adopted seven TRON-based cryptocurrencies as legal tender. Brison is now working to translate “the law in a manner that fits our Dutch legal system and local economy,” SMNN reported.","According to their website, “The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) was established in October 1983. It is the Monetary Authority for a group of eight island economies namely Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.” St. Maarten, one of four countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, is also a member. The ECCB monetary union has a total Gross Domestic Product of nearly $10 billion USD.","“The ECCB legislation is a great framework for regulation that focuses on protecting the consumer, the economy, and ensuring that virtual asset oversight does not spiral out of control, without stagnating potential growth opportunities for the sector,” Brison said. Crypto is currently unregulated by the Central Bank of Curacao and St. Maarten. “Allowing cryptocurrency to continue totally unregulated in St. Maarten is extremely risky, and we have to be proactive. Hence I use my right of initiative to bring this law with TRON Protocol at the forefront, with possibilities later for other blockchains to be incorporated; this too can be done in line with other countries like St. Kitts, who I know are also working on their own legal tender legislation,” stated Brison, as quoted by the SMNN.","TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. The TRON ecosystem is striving to make decentralized financial solutions and stable currency accessible to every human on the planet. Brison feels that collaboration with TRON will connect St. Maarten’s economy with the fastest-growing DeFi ecosystem in the world, thus increasing the island’s attractiveness both for innovative entrepreneurs as well as international tourists.","Brison will formally engage St. Maarten’s legislative process in the coming weeks, in accordance with the constitutional right MPs have to initiate laws, with the hope that official adoption will soon follow.","About TRON DAO","TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.","Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of January 2023, it has over 138 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.7 billion total transactions, and over $11.0 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry – TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON’s official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens – TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.","TRONNetwork | TRONDAO | Twitter | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum","","Hayward Wong [email protected]"],"create_date":"2023-01-24T01:31:56+01:00","tag":"blockchain","author":"chainwire"}

Launching in two stages, Beta 0.3.0 introduces a variety of new features, as well as improvements and fixes of existing functionalities.","Starting on January 12th, 2023, Phase 1 was exclusively available for Primex Early Users, who could be the first to have a hands-on experience with Beta 0.3.0. From now on, Early Users will get privileged access to all major protocol updates in the future (beginning from Beta 0.3.0). In addition to the chance to test new releases before other community members, participants of the program also enjoy further benefits, such as direct communication with the Primex team and fellow Early Users via Discord, as well as the ability to participate in private challenges and earn exclusive prizes.","On January 18th, 2023, the Primex team will open access for the public to Beta 0.3.0, allowing anyone to launch the application and test the new release without restrictions.","Beta 0.3.0 introduces four new core features. As the first and the most important, Primex now deploys to two new blockchains: the Polygon Mumbai and Polygon zkEVM testnets. Consequently, users can now test Primex by trading and lending digital assets on DEXs across four different blockchains (Ethereum Goerli, zkSync 2.0 testnet, Polygon Mumbai, and Polygon zkEVM testnet). With the new multi-chain functionality, traders and lenders can now swap between different networks via a single interface.","“When we asked our community which chains we should deploy Primex on, Polygon was by far the top choice among voters. While we were happy about the results, they didn’t come as a surprise for our team. Mumbai is the testnet of Polygon PoS, the Layer 2 blockchain with the highest DeFi TVL that can achieve up to 7,000 TPS. On the other hand, zkEVM is a newer solution that uses ZK-rollups via the ultra-fast Polygon Zero technology to achieve a 90% fee reduction for users on Ethereum’s L2. For these reasons, it makes great sense to deploy Primex on the testnets of these two blockchains,” said Vlad Kostanda, Primex Finance’s Co-Founder.","Besides the above core features, the Primex team introduced additional changes to the protocol as part of the Beta 0.3.0 update, including:","About Primex Finance","Founded in 2021, Primex Finance is the first-ever cross-chain prime brokerage protocol that seeks to solve the DeFi market’s liquidity fragmentation issue by enabling spot margin trading backed by lenders across numerous DEXs and blockchains with a totally decentralized trade execution mechanism. In September 2022, the team advanced to the next stage of its roadmap by launching the platform’s Beta release. Recently, the project rolled out Beta 0.3.0, a major update to the protocol introducing a wide range of important features, functionalities, and fixes.

A decentralized token-gated voting system for the inaugural awards, held at Art Basel Miami in November 2022, was open to the public with a number of nominees across nine categories such as NFT Project of the Year, DAO of the Year, and more.","EtherMail enabled Decrypt Studios to engage members of the community and distribute the Crypties voting NFT to voters, providing a seamless voting mechanism for the community to participate in selecting the winners of the Crypties Awards. Through this integration, Crypties voters will also now be able to receive future updates about the Crypties directly into their EtherMail inbox, driven by token-gated dynamic mailing lists. Thanks to EtherMail, Decrypt Studios received over 64,000 sign-ups with a 40% vote cast rate by airdropping NFTs to their community.","To vote for The Crypties, members simply had to create an EtherMail account, after which they received a welcome email inviting them to cast their vote on The Crypties voting platform.

Investors included gjmp, DG Daiwa Ventures, Coincheck, and Ceres. Funding will be used to help build out Bunzz’s Smart Contract Hub, which is already used by more than 8,000 dApp developers. (Product page: https://bunzz.dev/ )","Bunzz has established a strong track record since its launch 11 months ago. Over 8,000 DApp developers have been using the platform, and more than 3,000 DApp projects have been deployed on-chain, making it one of the largest DApp development infrastructures in Asia.","The platform has been recognized by top-tier landmarks as a major infrastructure service in the smart contract development sector. It has been featured on the web3 development infrastructure chaos map published by Coinbase. Additionally, Bunzz was also a finalist in Icetea Lab, Singapore’s largest web3 accelerator program.","","Currently, engineers who can handle DApp development are very rare. The reason is that the barrier to developing smart contracts, which are web3-specific programs, is high. In other words, if web2 software engineers could handle contract development, it would be much easier to enter the web3 space.","Bunzz has succeeded in simplifying the previously complex development process by providing frequently used contracts as modules and wrapping the preparation of nodes and the launch of the development environment.","About Bunzz’s core feature “Smart Contract Hub”","Bunzz offers a modularized version of frequently used smart contracts. These are freely available to general users and can be reused by other DApp developers.","On the other hand, there is a similar service called Open Zeppelin, an open-source library. The difference between this and Bunzz is convenience. While OZ’s code is just a library and cannot be deployed right away as it requires a development environment and nodes, Bunzz’s modules can be deployed with just a GUI. It is truly the “web3 version of Docker Hub”.","Partial list of smart contract modules offered by Bunzz","NFT related modules:","DeFi related modules:","Kenta Akutsu, CEO & Co-Founder of Bunzz, explained: “Bunzz ultimately aims to become web3’s equivalent to Docker Hub. Immutable smart contracts on the blockchain are open programs, also called ‘public goods,’ because anyone can access and use them without permission. However, the usage flow and the logic of their operation are difficult to understand, making it inconvenient for engineers who want to reuse them. Bunzz aims to solve this problem by incentivizing creators of smart contract modules to create more accurate coding and documentation.

Genesis Coin and Bitstop represent over 75+ operators operating 12,000+ Bitcoin ATMs in the United States and international markets powering billions of dollars in annual sales volume.","As part of the acquisition, Andrew Barnard will become Chief Executive Officer and Doug Carrillo will become Chief Strategy Officer and both will join the Board of Directors of Genesis Coin. Evan Rose, Genesis Coin’s founder, will stay on as a technical advisor and remain a member of the company’s Board of Directors. The Genesis Coin headquarters will move to Miami, Florida.","“Genesis Coin gave birth to the Bitcoin ATM industry,” said Barnard. “It’s the first and largest Bitcoin ATM software platform in The World. Evan built a platform trusted by some of the largest Bitcoin ATM operators in our industry, both domestically and internationally, including the Chivo network in partnership with the Government of El Salvador.","Our industry is now rapidly changing and Genesis Coin will lead the way into the future. Accomplishing this requires a solid team of world-class visionaries and developers. At Bitstop, we built an incredible software team and platform which has partnered with some of the largest companies both private and publicly traded from the traditional ATM industry. We plan to bring our background and expertise in building the best technology and team in the Bitcoin ATM industry to Genesis Coin. We believe this is a win-win for all stakeholders,” furthered Barnard.","“Andrew, Doug, and I have been friends for a long time and have also been friendly competitors,” commented Rose. “They have a reputation for their innovative and creative thinking. In addition, they have been successful in establishing key relationships in the Bitcoin space and their technical expertise and knowledge of Bitcoin is very impressive. In turn, this has allowed them to attract and retain top-tier talent and build great products. This transaction represents the coming together of the two leading software platforms in the industry and creates value for both companies’ stakeholders. It combines the best product, engineering, and leadership teams in the space. I’m thrilled to work alongside them and look forward to introducing very exciting new products and services we have planned for this year,” commented Rose.","Barnard, Carrillo and Rose stressed the importance of continuing to provide stability to both platforms and continuing to service the needs of operators on both platforms. For the time being, both the Genesis Coin and Bitstop platforms will continue to run independently while exploring technical synergies.

We truly believe that this new combination of the best minds in our space will be the catalyst for the Bitcoin ATM industry evolving into its next phase. We are hyper-focused on building the best software for Bitcoin ATMs in the world. Today, the most sophisticated operators in our industry rely on Genesis Coin and Bitstop technology to power their businesses. As a result, we have become ‘The Standard’ in the Bitcoin ATM space where virtually all industry organic M&A activity today is occurring on the Genesis Coin and Bitstop networks.” concluded Carrillo.","“Leverage dominated the entire cryptocurrency space over the last two years. Many other platforms in our industry couldn’t resist the siren song,” said Barnard. “This is a capital-intensive industry where you do not want to be in a lot of debt. Genesis Coin is financially secure with a strong balance sheet, no debt, and strong cash flow. The company does not have external investors. The result of this is that operators can build their future on the Genesis Coin platform with confidence. In a volatile industry, we are a beacon of stability. We are bullish on the potential of this industry. We see significant market growth from here over the next 10 years. We believe we are in the best position in the industry to unite the very best operators and support their growth. Our goal is to listen to our operators and deliver the very best products and features to them so they can deliver maximum value to their customers at scale,” concluded Barnard.","","About Genesis Coin","Genesis Coin is the first and largest white-label Bitcoin ATM network worldwide.

Gaming is one such industry. Web3 in gaming may be considered the beginning of this journey now that we are on the verge of welcoming the future with web3.","Web3 games are technically digital games that store data and conduct transactions using blockchain technology. In web3 games, the underlying component of the economy is tangibly owned assets and a liquid market to trade and sell those assets.","The incorporation of blockchain mechanisms in web3 games has resulted in widespread adoption of concepts such as play-to-earn and NFT. In such games, in-game assets are mostly in the form of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. These tokens promise digital asset ownership proof and seamless trading. The play-to-earn gaming model provided players with the opportunity to not only play and relax, but also to earn money while doing so.","As promising as Web3 gaming appears, realizing it may become more difficult without adequate support for both players and developers.","There are various web3 games development platforms and technology striving to ensure that they cater to the needs of gamers and game developers looking to participate in Web3.

Among these has emerged a leader, ETFSwap (ETFS), which holds more promise than all the altcoins combined.","The gaming industry has seen tremendous growth in the last few years as altcoins leveraging this sector continue to pop up. To put this in perspective, this sector was worth around $9 billion in 2021. Fast forward three years, and it is currently valued at over $19 billion, thanks to positive gaming narratives.","Despite its growth so far, present narratives indicate that gaming could continue to grow to be worth over $50 billion by 2031. Gaming’s growth is just one example of how powerful narratives can be, showing the possibilities of other narratives.","Just like gaming, Crypto AI is enjoying a lot of positive narratives. Unlike other sectors of the crypto industry, AI tokens are strictly power-specific projects. Despite that, the rise of AI tools continues to position these digital assets in a positive light.","The integration of AI and blockchain is expected to deepen, potentially increasing the demand for AI-based crypto tokens. The leading altcoins in this space include Fetch.ai (FET), Render (RNDR), Golem (GLM), and The Graph (GRT).","These altcoins are already making waves thanks to their affiliation with AI projects. Market experts also predict that AI altcoins are set for more growth despite currently having only a $20 billion market cap.","Real World Assets (RWAs) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are two sectors currently receiving positive narratives in the crypto industry. RWAs are reshaping investment strategies within the evolving crypto narrative.","The RWA crypto market is still new but already worth around $8.5 billion, while companies like Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Centrifuge (CFG) lead this sector. Through their services, these platforms make investing in and trading real-world assets more accessible through blockchain technology.","Similarly, the DePIN narrative has gained substantial traction this year. Messari has listed DePIN as one of the Top 10 Trends in Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure in 2024. The cloud infrastructure services sector boasts a $5 trillion market cap in legacy markets, with DePIN representing just 0.1% of that value.","Messari emphasizes that DePIN’s storage solutions could address the growing storage demand driven by AI and Big Data companies. Trending tokens in this sector include Arweave (AR) and Hivemapper (HONEY).","ETFSwap (ETFS) has grown steadily to become not just the top project around narratives like RWA, but it has championed a whole new narrative: altcoins based on crypto ETFs. By being the first in this sector, the platform has secured the coveted first-mover advantage in what is expected to be a trillion-dollar sector.","The positive narrative surrounding ETFSwap (ETFS) is due to its unique features. This platform intends to bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi by tokenizing ETFs for trading on the blockchain for trading. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this platform tokenizes various ETFs, from crypto ETFs to Mining ETFs, to Commodities, among others, allowing crypto users to own and trade them easily.","This diversification helps users to adequately spread risk and broaden their investments. Additionally, it could lead to potentially huge returns across different investments as previously elusive yet lucrative traditional investments are making it to the blockchain for the first time.","Additionally, ETFSwap (ETFS) empowers flexible portfolio management, as well as an unprecedented two-way conversion. In simple terms, investors can convert any crypto asset into an ETF and back to cash or cryptocurrency. This is possible because the platform provides access to unlimited market liquidity, making real-time swaps and conversions possible.","A rigorous audit by the respected crypto firm Cyberscope has confirmed that the platform is a secure trading environment. Furthermore, it removes barriers to entry by eliminating the need for KYC verification during signup, allowing all investors to enjoy the offers of the platform.","To access the ETFSwap platform, users must hold its native ETFS token, which unlocks the entire ecosystem. This is why its presale has gone viral in the crypto community, selling out over 80 million tokens already. This surge has piqued the interest of numerous crypto investors actively pursuing sustainable investment opportunities.","The ETFS token is currently in stage 1 of its presale, selling tokens at $0.00854 each, presenting a golden investment opportunity. By stage 2, the price is expected to jump 100% to $0.01831, which makes this the best time to invest.","For more information about the ETFS Presale:","Visit ETFSwap Presale","Join The ETFSwap Community","TheBitcoinNews.com – Bitcoin News source since June 2011 –","Virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to consumer protections.

The integration introduces an essential tool for developers that automates compliance within their protocols, allowing them to focus on shipping high-impact projects instead of spending time developing tools to meet complex, ever-changing regulations that often differ across jurisdictions.","Institutions are eager to engage with DeFi protocols and technology but need to ensure that all of their trades, and trading partners, meet their compliance standards. Until now, these institutional players have been forced to either trade in manually managed pools with limited liquidity and trading volume, or to avoid DeFi altogether. With DeFi Sentinel on Sui, developers can meet institutional as well as regulator requirements via a one-time integration.","DeFi Sentinel leverages Netki’s advanced technology to provide real-time KYC/AML, wallet screening, financial transaction monitoring, securities compliance, and tax compliance, all now integrated directly within the DeFi protocols on Sui that choose to implement the tool. The solution combines on-chain and off-chain data to ensure each transaction adheres to institutional risk, as well as regulatory standards.","Sui will also integrate Netki’s OnboardID, which, for protocols that enable it, enhances user onboarding and identity verification processes, reducing costs and simplifying compliance around the onramping process for Sui developers’ applications. Netki’s integration represents a significant advancement in making decentralized financial systems safer and more accessible globally.","“DeFi protocols are poised to transform financial services by enhancing accessibility and transparency, but many of the best ideas fail to get off the ground due to compliance concerns,” said Evan Cheng, CEO of Mysten Labs, the original contributor to Sui. “Netki’s integration not only fortifies the security and compliance of transactions on Sui but also assures institutional and individual participants of their adherence to evolving regulatory requirements, and most importantly, gives developers the peace of mind to build with confidence.”","Netki’s DeFi compliance oracle is unique in the industry, enabling transaction-by-transaction compliance, which is crucial for institutional adoption of DeFi tools. With features like real-time name and wallet screening, the solution ensures that compliance and risk management are seamlessly integrated into the transaction flow without compromising the user experience or developer agility.","“By integrating DeFi Sentinel with Sui’s robust and scalable blockchain infrastructure, we are setting a new standard for safety and compliance in the DeFi space,” said Justin Newton, CEO of Netki. “We aim to enable the safe and widespread adoption of DeFi technologies, ensuring that developers can focus on innovation while evolving and expanding compliance requirements are effortlessly met.”","","Sui Foundation [email protected]"],"create_date":"2024-05-16T15:00:38+02:00","tag":"blockchain","author":"chainwire"}

Keiser refers to this potential event as the “God Candle,” suggesting a massive influx of capital could create an unprecedented spike.","While price predictions in the cryptocurrency world should always be taken with skepticism, Keiser’s forecast has sparked considerable interest in how such a Bitcoin surge would impact other cryptocurrencies.","In crypto terminology, a “God Candle” refers to a dramatic and sustained price increase for a cryptocurrency, often sparked by major events or shifts in market sentiment.","In this case, the predicted God Candle for Bitcoin investment is linked to the idea that institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds may soon significantly enter the market.","While it’s impossible to say with certainty which altcoins would benefit most from a Bitcoin surge, here are some notable projects worth keeping an eye on, along with reasons why they might see substantial gains:","Ethereum’s strong fundamentals and increasing adoption in the DeFi and NFT sectors make it a prime candidate for a significant price surge. Contrary to Bitcoin, known as a “decentralized currency,” Ethereum should be viewed as a distributed computing network.","With a market cap of over $362.2 billion, Ethereum stands out among the more than 26,000 crypto assets available today, contributing significantly to the total market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.","Solana’s fast transaction processing, low fees, and growing ecosystem of DeFi applications make it an attractive option for investors seeking a high-growth in cryptocurrency future.","Its recent price movements (about 587.1% in the past year) and market trends indicate it could experience a significant price surge driven by increasing adoption and demand.","XRP’s historical performance during similar market conditions, such as the 2017 cryptocurrency boom, suggests it could experience a massive price increase during this period.","Despite its slow market growth compared to other cryptocurrencies, its recent market movements and analyst predictions indicate it could be poised for a significant upward trajectory during this period.","Polkadot’s strong fundamentals, including its growing ecosystem of DeFi applications and its potential for significant adoption in the Web3 space, make it an attractive option for investors.","Its relatively low market capitalization compared to other major cryptocurrencies also increases its potential for significant price appreciation. According to Max Thake, co-founder of Peaq, there is a sustained demand for DOT from projects aiming to build on Polkadot.","Bottom Line","As the crypto market anticipates the potential of a “God Candle” event, getting the best opportunity can greatly maximize your gains.","Among the myriad of altcoins available, more seasoned investors are settling on RCO Finance (RCOF) as a standout option, citing “several compelling reasons.” It has a robust infrastructure that offers unprecedented opportunities, and it integrates AI technology that is becoming vital in trading crypto and stock.","For more information about the RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale:","Visit RCO Finance Presale","Join The RCO Finance Community","TheBitcoinNews.com – Bitcoin News source since June 2011 –","Virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to consumer protections.

It doesn’t matter if it’s a bull market or a bear market – innovation doesn’t stop. We’ve always been focused on strengthening our resources to support our mission, with a more consolidated approach through Guild Hub,” stressed Ing.","Launched in late 2022, Guild Hub is BSPC’s initiative to help create legitimacy among Web3 communities by delivering an effective way of policing the community and providing a venue to create impactful and valuable partnerships. The Metasports acquisition will be instrumental in fostering further business growth, allowing BSPC to continue supporting the community.","“Esports and guilds are not going away as they are integral to Web3 gaming,” added Ing. “Metasports will be essential in serving these guilds.”","The acquisition of Metasports, with its proven capabilities in the gaming and content creator space, will further expand the opportunities for $GUILD token integration, solidifying BSPC’s position as a leader in providing comprehensive and user-friendly solutions for guilds and Web3 projects.","Metasports, which launched in December 2021, focuses on Web3 and Web2 gaming IPs across esports, creator networks, and news and media verticals.

In BlockchainSpace, we found a partner that would be the backbone which we could build on Web3. By tapping BlockchainSpace’s infrastructure, we will finally be able to build technology-backed IPs, which is a powerful next step for us,” Josue shared.","With BSPC’s and Metasports’ sights set on scalability this year, both companies look forward to bringing in major changes that will not only impact their business development but contribute to the success and longevity of the growing global Web3 community.","About BlockchainSpace BlockchainSpace is the one-stop-shop for all guild needs that provides essential, scalable infrastructure, digital tools, financing solutions, and networking opportunities.
