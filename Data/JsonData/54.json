Imagine having both the speediest EVM in the game and the best tools to build on it – that’s what AppLayer brings to the table!","The Game Changer: Stateful Pre-compiled Smart Contracts","AppLayer is not only a speed powerhouse but also allows for comprehensive composability with game-changing stateful pre-compiles that are a cornerstone of this release, offering an unmatched ability to process complex smart contracts at unprecedented speeds.","But what does this mean for everyday users and developers? It’s simple: AppLayer’s network brings the power of advanced blockchain technology right to the user’s fingertips. Developers can now create their own stateful pre-compiles as smart contracts with features and syntax that are identical to Solidity, but with the added turbo-charge of C++ performance.","The real excitement stems from the intricate workings of AppLayer’s network with these Stateful Pre-compiles. Solidity smart contracts no longer function in isolation but interact with and build upon these ultra-fast pre-compiles. This enhances the sophistication, power, and efficiency of blockchain applications, marking a significant shift in the landscape of decentralization.","The best part for developers is the ease of transition to this high-performance environment. AppLayer allows developers to effortlessly convert their existing Solidity code into C++ with nearly identical syntax, unlocking the potential for more complex and scalable dApps. This feature is especially vital for blockchain projects hitting performance limitations in traditional EVM environments.","AppLayer takes it further with rdPoS (random deterministic Proof of Stake) – a unique consensus mechanism that amplifies network security while ensuring ultra-efficient transaction processing. This ingenious combination of stateful pre-compiles and rdPoS turns AppLayer into a robust platform perfect for handling high-scale and intricate applications.","As Itamar Carvalho, CTO at AppLayer, stated at ETHDenver 2024, “AppLayer is not just an upgrade; it’s a revolution. We’re empowering developers to build without boundaries, pushing the limits of what’s possible in blockchain application development.”","AppLayer stands as a testament to innovation, redefining the standards of blockchain development and opening new horizons in the gaming sector, decentralized finance, and beyond. With its combination of speed, efficiency, and developer-friendly features, AppLayer is poised to become a leading force in the blockchain space.","Expanding EVM Horizons with the Testnet Launch","The next exciting phase for AppLayer is the deployment of its testnet, complete with a front-end user portal coming in June and up to $1.5 million in incentives available now.

Imagine having both the speediest EVM in the game and the best tools to build on it – that’s what AppLayer brings to the table!","The Game Changer: Stateful Pre-compiled Smart Contracts","AppLayer is not only a speed powerhouse but also allows for comprehensive composability with game-changing stateful pre-compiles that are a cornerstone of this release, offering an unmatched ability to process complex smart contracts at unprecedented speeds.","But what does this mean for everyday users and developers? It’s simple: AppLayer’s network brings the power of advanced blockchain technology right to the user’s fingertips. Developers can now create their own stateful pre-compiles as smart contracts with features and syntax that are identical to Solidity, but with the added turbo-charge of C++ performance.","The real excitement stems from the intricate workings of AppLayer’s network with these Stateful Pre-compiles. Solidity smart contracts no longer function in isolation but interact with and build upon these ultra-fast pre-compiles. This enhances the sophistication, power, and efficiency of blockchain applications, marking a significant shift in the landscape of decentralization.","The best part for developers is the ease of transition to this high-performance environment. AppLayer allows developers to effortlessly convert their existing Solidity code into C++ with nearly identical syntax, unlocking the potential for more complex and scalable dApps. This feature is especially vital for blockchain projects hitting performance limitations in traditional EVM environments.","AppLayer takes it further with rdPoS (random deterministic Proof of Stake) – a unique consensus mechanism that amplifies network security while ensuring ultra-efficient transaction processing. This ingenious combination of stateful pre-compiles and rdPoS turns AppLayer into a robust platform perfect for handling high-scale and intricate applications.","As Itamar Carvalho, CTO at AppLayer, stated at ETHDenver 2024, “AppLayer is not just an upgrade; it’s a revolution. We’re empowering developers to build without boundaries, pushing the limits of what’s possible in blockchain application development.”","AppLayer stands as a testament to innovation, redefining the standards of blockchain development and opening new horizons in the gaming sector, decentralized finance, and beyond.

Imagine having both the speediest EVM in the game and the best tools to build on it – that’s what AppLayer brings to the table!","The Game Changer: Stateful Pre-compiled Smart Contracts","AppLayer is not only a speed powerhouse but also allows for comprehensive composability with game-changing stateful pre-compiles that are a cornerstone of this release, offering an unmatched ability to process complex smart contracts at unprecedented speeds.","But what does this mean for everyday users and developers? It’s simple: AppLayer’s network brings the power of advanced blockchain technology right to the user’s fingertips. Developers can now create their own stateful pre-compiles as smart contracts with features and syntax that are identical to Solidity, but with the added turbo-charge of C++ performance.","The real excitement stems from the intricate workings of AppLayer’s network with these Stateful Pre-compiles. Solidity smart contracts no longer function in isolation but interact with and build upon these ultra-fast pre-compiles. This enhances the sophistication, power, and efficiency of blockchain applications, marking a significant shift in the landscape of decentralization.","The best part for developers is the ease of transition to this high-performance environment. AppLayer allows developers to effortlessly convert their existing Solidity code into C++ with nearly identical syntax, unlocking the potential for more complex and scalable dApps. This feature is especially vital for blockchain projects hitting performance limitations in traditional EVM environments.","AppLayer takes it further with rdPoS (random deterministic Proof of Stake) – a unique consensus mechanism that amplifies network security while ensuring ultra-efficient transaction processing. This ingenious combination of stateful pre-compiles and rdPoS turns AppLayer into a robust platform perfect for handling high-scale and intricate applications.","As Itamar Carvalho, CTO at AppLayer, stated at ETHDenver 2024, “AppLayer is not just an upgrade; it’s a revolution.

This is an opportunity to reshape the landscape of blockchain applications,” said Carvalho.","The AppLayer testnet not only represents a pivotal moment for blockchain innovation but also a unique opportunity for both crypto enthusiasts and developers. Whether the user is looking to explore cutting-edge projects on the fastest EVM or the user is a developer eager to build on this revolutionary platform, AppLayer’s testnet is their gateway to opportunity and rewards.","Build on the AppLayer Testnet to Unlock Grants","Developers, on the other hand, are invited to bring their creativity and technical skills to the forefront. Build on AppLayer, the fastest EVM network, and receive $APPL token grants as recognition of the user’s innovative contributions.","With up to 100,000,000 $APPL tokens available for allocation to projects, the potential for reward is substantial. Additionally, for every $APPL token a project distributes to users, an equal amount is granted back to the project, forming a cycle of innovation and reward that continues through to the mainnet launch.","The most engaging and interacted-with projects may be eligible for additional allocations, incentivizing not just development but also user engagement. This is a testnet that rewards utilization and creativity, pushing for more unique and complex smart contracts.","For more information on the Grants Program and how to participate, users can fill out an application to get started and become a part of this transformative phase in blockchain development.

The integration introduces an essential tool for developers that automates compliance within their protocols, allowing them to focus on shipping high-impact projects instead of spending time developing tools to meet complex, ever-changing regulations that often differ across jurisdictions.","Institutions are eager to engage with DeFi protocols and technology but need to ensure that all of their trades, and trading partners, meet their compliance standards. Until now, these institutional players have been forced to either trade in manually managed pools with limited liquidity and trading volume, or to avoid DeFi altogether. With DeFi Sentinel on Sui, developers can meet institutional as well as regulator requirements via a one-time integration.","DeFi Sentinel leverages Netki’s advanced technology to provide real-time KYC/AML, wallet screening, financial transaction monitoring, securities compliance, and tax compliance, all now integrated directly within the DeFi protocols on Sui that choose to implement the tool. The solution combines on-chain and off-chain data to ensure each transaction adheres to institutional risk, as well as regulatory standards.","Sui will also integrate Netki’s OnboardID, which, for protocols that enable it, enhances user onboarding and identity verification processes, reducing costs and simplifying compliance around the onramping process for Sui developers’ applications. Netki’s integration represents a significant advancement in making decentralized financial systems safer and more accessible globally.","“DeFi protocols are poised to transform financial services by enhancing accessibility and transparency, but many of the best ideas fail to get off the ground due to compliance concerns,” said Evan Cheng, CEO of Mysten Labs, the original contributor to Sui. “Netki’s integration not only fortifies the security and compliance of transactions on Sui but also assures institutional and individual participants of their adherence to evolving regulatory requirements, and most importantly, gives developers the peace of mind to build with confidence.”","Netki’s DeFi compliance oracle is unique in the industry, enabling transaction-by-transaction compliance, which is crucial for institutional adoption of DeFi tools. With features like real-time name and wallet screening, the solution ensures that compliance and risk management are seamlessly integrated into the transaction flow without compromising the user experience or developer agility.","“By integrating DeFi Sentinel with Sui’s robust and scalable blockchain infrastructure, we are setting a new standard for safety and compliance in the DeFi space,” said Justin Newton, CEO of Netki. “We aim to enable the safe and widespread adoption of DeFi technologies, ensuring that developers can focus on innovation while evolving and expanding compliance requirements are effortlessly met.”","","Sui Foundation media@sui.io","The post Crypto Pioneer Netki Powers Seamless KYC and Compliance Solutions Across the Sui Ecosystem appeared first on BitcoinWorld."],"create_date":"2024-05-16T13:04:41+05:30","tag":"","author":"chainwire"}

It represents the value that people in the market currently believe the coin holds.","Realised Value (RV) is calculated by multiplying the trade price at which each coin was last traded with the number of coins moved at that price. It shows the price at which each coin was originally acquired, giving a historical perspective on the value.","The standard deviation of market value measures how much the market value of a cryptocurrency varies from its average. Here’s a simple example to understand it with proper clarity:","Step 1: Collect trade price data on the market value of the crypto token over a certain period e.g. Day 1: $100, Day 2: $120, Day 3: $110.","Step 2: Determine the Mean (Average) Market Value by adding all the market trade values we collected in the last step and dividing by the number of data points. For our calculated data we will get $(100 + 120 + 110) / 3 \u003d $110.","Step 3: Now calculate the Variance of this data. For each market value, subtract the mean and square the result.
