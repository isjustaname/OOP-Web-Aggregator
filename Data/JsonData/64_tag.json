As user bases and transaction volumes grow, these networks struggle to keep pace, leading to slow confirmations and skyrocketing fees. Enter Validium Network, a revolutionary blockchain architecture poised to break these barriers and usher in a new era of blockchain innovation.","Validium Network’s secret weapon lies in its modular design. Imagine a high-performance car where the engine and chassis are separate units. Validium Network operates similarly, decoupling transaction processing from data storage. This allows transactions to occur off-chain, significantly reducing the workload on the main blockchain. Think of it as taking the heavy lifting off the shoulders of the network, freeing it up for crucial tasks like security and governance.","This innovative approach unlocks a treasure trove of benefits:","Unmatched Scalability: With transactions happening off-chain, Validium Network can handle a massive influx of activity, paving the way for real-world adoption and high-volume applications.","Lightning-Fast Transactions: Say goodbye to agonizing wait times! Off-chain processing significantly reduces transaction latency, leading to near-instantaneous confirmations.","Ironclad Security: Here’s where things get really clever. Validium Network utilizes the power of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). These cryptographic marvels act as digital receipts, proving the legitimacy of transactions without revealing any sensitive details. Imagine proving you paid a bill without anyone else seeing the amount or recipient! ZKPs ensure the integrity of off-chain transactions while upholding user privacy – a win-win for security and personal data protection.","Reduced Transaction Fees: By decongesting the main chain, Validium Network paves the way for significantly lower transaction fees. This opens up participation in the blockchain ecosystem to a wider audience and fosters greater innovation.","Developer Flexibility: Validium Network isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Its modular design empowers developers to choose between on-chain and off-chain processing based on their application’s specific needs. This flexibility allows developers to optimize their dApps for both performance and privacy.","Future-Proof Efficiency: Validium Network employs a strategic storage approach. Only essential data (hashed transactions and ZKPs) resides on the main chain, minimizing long-term storage requirements and ensuring the network’s efficiency scales with time.","The impact of Validium Network stretches far beyond the realm of financial transactions. Its modular architecture holds the potential to revolutionize various industries:","Validium Network is a testament to the power of innovative thinking in the blockchain space. By addressing the scalability and security challenges that have plagued traditional blockchains, Validium Network empowers developers to build the next generation of dApps across a broad spectrum of industries. This modular mastermind is poised to usher in a new era of blockchain adoption and unlock the true potential of decentralized applications.","Discuss this news on our Telegram Community.

The birds NFT is dropping their collection onto the Bitcoin’s NFT Ordinals Protocol with a $200,000 prize for one of the participants.","Moonbird NFTs attracted nearly $500 million in sales last April. Users now will have a chance to enter the promising Birds NFT collection on Bitcoin via the recently introduced Ordinals protocol.","After a meteoric rise in popularity, the BAYC monkeys have solidified themselves as one of the top-selling NFT collections, with a whopping value of $1.3M. The descendant of the final collection of NFTs has now been released on the Bitcoin blockchain, drawing lots of attention from the NFT enthusiasts worldwide.","The Birds NFT collection is about to pick up the trend, dropping their collection onto the Bitcoin’s NFT Ordinals Protocol with a $200,000 prize for one of the participants. Birds BTC is a collection of unique utility-enabled PFPs that feature a rich, diverse and unique pool of rarity-powered traits on the Ordinals protocol. The collection is bound to live up to its global name and maintain its unchallenged leadership in the NFT “PFP” space, spinning off as Bitcoin NFTs.","Consisting of 10,000 PFPs, the collection comes with a special set of rare traits available on Ordinals. With design elements comparable to projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, it’s no surprise this Bitcoin-based series has sparked excitement in the entire NFT space.","The world of Bitcoin and NFTs is getting more interesting by the minute. The demand for a reunion with the “root of all blockchains” has sent its growth skyrocketing, proving this could be another sign pointing towards the bull market. The ordinals protocol has been shaking up the crypto marketplace ever since making its debut in 2014. However, it was only two weeks ago that things truly started to heat up when NFTs found their way onto Bitcoin’s blockchain thanks to the nifty code updates of SegWit and Taproot. Adding even more fuel to the fire, Ordinals recently made headlines again as they debuted a collection called ‘Ordinal Punks,’ taking inspiration from CryptoPunks’ iconic designs. The Birds NFT collection is the next to join the fast-growing Bitcoin NFT boom. Since the Moonbirds launch on April 16th, 2022 on Ethereum, it has already raked in a whopping $500 million from the buyers, with an impressive first 48 hours being bolstered by over $200 million alone. Ethereum put up quite a fight, but now bets are firmly placed against them as speculators make bold predictions of even greater success for its Bitcoin “spin-offs” down the line. With record revenues and CryptoSlam placing this project second only to their bestselling counterpart, it’s not a surprise that its titanic popularity has attracted some high-profile fans such as Beeple, Tim Ferriss, Garry Vee and Alex Ohanian, among many others. Its 10k utility-enabled PFP tokens provide additional value along with unique mint features, making sure that the Moonbirds stay flying high. After the first 500 Bird NFTs are purchased, $5,000 will be split among 32 purchasers. Once the 10,000 Bird NFTs are sold out, $200,000 will be awarded to a random purchaser. Purchasing more than 10 Bird NFTs in one transaction applies a discount of 5 up to 20%.","Discuss this news on our Telegram Community.

This decision will have significant repercussions for the world economy and is being closely watched by investors, including those in the cryptocurrency market.","The current crisis has put US-based banks in a vulnerable position, and any further increase in interest rates could cripple them. To address this, the Federal Reserve is expected to provide assurances that the banking crisis will be contained.","The main goal of the Fed so far has been to contain inflation, which is still high, particularly in the service sector. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further complicated matters, leading to an increase in food prices as Russia-Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat.","Economists predict that the central bank will also release projections about the economy and the path of rate hikes, though this has not been confirmed yet. The Fed’s decision will have a significant impact on the global economy, and investors will be watching closely for any indications of future market trends.","Impact On Bitcoin & Crypto Markets","Cryptocurrency investors are keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting as they await the outcome of the meeting. Cryptocurrency prices have been trading slightly higher in anticipation of the decision, with Bitcoin leading the way above the $28,000 level. However, experts predict a slight fall in prices if the Fed announces a 25 basis points increase. Despite this, Bitcoin’s open interest has increased to $13 billion, indicating that investors remain confident in the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects.","Discuss this news on our Telegram Community.

While DeFi projects still enjoy a significant market and robust demand from the current user requirements’ standpoint, blockchain games are quickly regaining popularity among blockchain industry enthusiasts.","Comparable to DeFi’s growth trajectory, the industry’s creators and value-capturers are always the first in line to capitalize on new trends in the NFT sector. Versailles Heroes is a massively multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game with a grand epic background that has decided to join this new market trend following the return of blockchain games’ popularity. Versailles Heroes serves as an excellent value creator for NFT collectors as the project devotes itself to creating a blockchain game that players can effectively play.","According to their recent tweet, the Versailles Heroes NFT will soon November 25th be available on Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Before making its way to Binance, this exciting NFT project went live on OpenSea, Coinbase, the OKX NFT marketplace, and other well-known NFT marketplaces.","Incorporating GameFi, DeFi, NFT, and Metaverse aspects into a pure chain game, Versailles Heroes is built on the Ethereum to make use of its ecological prowess and technological effectiveness.","By using the open, fair, and decentralized features of DAO smart contracts, the developers of the blockchain game are quickly realizing its roadmap to offer a game that everyone can contribute to.","Versailles Heroes aims to strengthen the ecosystem by becoming a cutting-edge framework for game planning, design, and production, guaranteeing an exceptional experience of entertainment and gaming excitement, and using robust tools for effective player interaction and participation.","The Empire of Missihill, Empire of Dresk, Rothstein City, Azbanca, and the North Thousand Island are the five places that the game focuses on, with the Versailles continent from star wars serving as a clue. The diverse roles that these areas play in the game are based on their geography and the sorts of people that live there. Rothstein, for instance, is the birthplace of many heroes and the arena of the Versailles continent.","","With a deep storyline in place, classic games like Warcraft and League of Legends take a more visceral approach to developing game modes and settings for hero characters. Heroes and their weapons in the game are assigned certain roles, such as mages, assassins, marksmen, tanks, and support and so on. All these characters’ weapons are based on the NFT of ERC-721 standard, and each one has its own special qualities.","Versailles Heroes offers a variety of distinct game modes, such as the Practice Grounds, Deathmatch (4V4 Classic Match), Battle Royale Solo/Duos, Trophy Collection (4V4 Special Game), Inhibitor Rush(4V4 King’s Canyon), Battle Wager Mode, Custom Wager Mode, and so on to keep players involved and cater to a wide range of preferences.","When the game launches, players who buy NFT heroes or weapons, play in whatever mode they choose, and follow the rules may earn a lot of money.","Versailles Heroes has duo tokenomics which is a consistent economic model with the standard for blockchain games in the NFT space.","The NFT game has two tokens called MOH and VRH. While the former is used mostly for in-game circulation (purchasing gold, NFT, props, etc.), the latter is used to aid with DAO governance outside of the game (voting, pledging, trading, etc.).","Playing for gold is the primary source of MOH while pledging and voting are the primary sources of VRH, both of which may be bought and sold on the market. It is possible to exchange both on the market.","Users that want to speed up the mining of VRH may get Gas by burning MOH, and the quantity of VRH mined by users is calculated based on the weight of the whole network’s Gas, ensuring a more even distribution of MOH and VRH. By utilizing MOH as the form of Gas to boost VRH mining speed to up to 2.5 times is a major function of MOH outside of the game. It is a valuable application of in-game token which helps balance the circulation and avoid devaluation of MOH. The prices of both tokens are stabilized by limiting the expansion of the circulating disk in this manner.","Versailles Heroes classifies its characters and weapons into four tiers—common, rare, epic, and legendary—based on the difficulty level used to balance the game. Upgrading heroes is an essential component of the game since various levels of heroes and weapons receive varying privileges and token awards in battles, such as legendary-level heroes and weapons having access to additional combat fields or daily MOH rewards.","The game also features the ELO system and AI players considering the level restrictions. The ELO system will match players appropriately based on their game experience and win rate, pairing players with opponents of a similar level as far as possible to provide fairness and a positive gaming experience. New players will be paired with AI to lessen the complexity of the game.","After the launch of NFT trading marketplaces like OpenSea, Coinbase, and OKX, the development of the NFT MOBA Game Versailles Heroes has significantly accelerated to provide NFT owners and collectors with the game very soon.","Before the game testing begins, Versailles Heroes will officially release a mystery box worldwide. Those who buy it will have a chance to get legendary-level hero weapons and NFT heroes at random. Top heroes and weapons translate into high game income, therefore participating in mystery box sales allows early NFT adopters to make more profits than making a straight purchase from the NFT market.","When the game launches, the NFT project will shortly begin a round of IDO to give community investors a very cheap price, which, according to the prediction, could be the lowest price in the history of VRH. This is due to the game’s governance tokens, VRH, more than 70% will be distributed to community, ensuring a smooth start of DAO governance.","We predict that Versailles Heroes will become the next best chain game thanks to its massive game design, diversified gameplay, fair game regulations, and acceptable duo pass model, as well as its online NFT release on Coinbase, OpenSea, OKX, and other giants platforms.","Discuss this news on our Telegram Community.

Compatible with EMV standards, zkSync allows for faster and more cost-effective transactions while preserving the security of the Ethereum network. zkSync is created and run by Matter lab. The protocol has raised $469 million in funding from prominent investors.","","zkSync (pronounced “zee-kay-sync”) is a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution that implements Zero Knowledge rollups, a much-awaited scaling solution proposed by Vitalik Buterin for Ethereum. It is one of the first protocols to build a fully EVM-compatible zk-rollup, allowing developers to easily deploy their current Ethereum DApps to zkSync with minimal modifications.","Designed by Matter Labs, zkSync has raised $469 million in funding and has already bridged almost $871 million worth of assets to its network, making it one of the most promising Ethereum scaling solutions.","","zkSync is an EVM-compatible network that is part of a family of Layer-2 scaling solutions. Specifically, zkSync implements zero-knowledge proof cryptography, which allows for transactions to be executed off-chain while still ensuring their validity through a valid cryptographic proof that is submitted to the main chain.","As zkSync is an EVM-compatible blockchain, developers can easily use it with little to no modification on their existing smart contracts. However, it’s important to note that zkSync makes some changes to the Ethereum bytecode, so developers may need to perform an additional compilation step when porting their application to zkSync.","With its implementation of zero-knowledge proof cryptography, zkSync offers a range of benefits for the Ethereum ecosystem, including faster transaction times, lower fees, and increased scalability.","","One major challenge that has plagued the blockchain industry from the start is scalability. To compete with traditional centralized payment networks, blockchains must be able to match their speed, but decentralization and security have made this difficult.","This challenge has been dubbed the “Blockchain Trilemma” which states that a blockchain can only have two out of three things: security, scalability, and decentralization. Popular blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have chosen to prioritize security and decentralization, which has left them struggling to keep up with the transaction throughput of traditional networks.","Many popular blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum focus on security and decentralization.","But if blockchains have to replace the legacy network, they have to match the the transaction throughput of the current systems.","Enter Layer 2 network – these networks build on top of an underlying blockchain protocol to improve speed and efficiency. By shifting the bulk of computation to a different network adjacent to the main network, the base layer is less congested and ultimately more scalable.","zkSync is an example of Layer 2 scaling solutions.","There are currently 5 types of layer-2 scaling solutions:","","A Rollup is a type of scaling solution for Ethereum that operates off the main Ethereum network. It works by bundling individual transactions into batches, which are then executed separately and the resulting data is posted to the main Ethereum network once all the transactions in the batch have been processed. This approach enables faster transaction processing while still ensuring the security of the Ethereum network.","There are currently two types of Rollups","zkSync is an example of ZK-Rollups.","","ZK Rollups are a specific type of Rollup solution for Ethereum that operates off-chain, where transactions are bundled together and processed outside the main Ethereum network. ZK Rollups use zero knowledge cryptography to provide a validity proof that proves the accuracy of the transaction without revealing any transaction details. This proof ensures that the changes made to the Ethereum network are a direct result of the transactions in the batch. This approach allows for faster processing times and increased privacy while maintaining the security and integrity of the Ethereum network.","zkSync is an example of zk-rollup based scaling solution for Ethereum.","","zkSync is a state-of-the-art Ethereum scaling solution that utilizes zero-knowledge rollups technology, which offers several benefits over traditional methods. With zkSync, users can enjoy lower gas fees and higher transaction throughput thanks to the use of zk-rollups. This cutting-edge approach to scaling has positioned zkSync as a promising solution for those seeking faster, more efficient, and cost-effective Ethereum transactions.","Here are a list of the top features and benefits of zkSync","","zkSync is pretty straightforward to use if you are familiar with other blockchains.","For Developers: Developers can instantly port their existing EVM compaitbale DApp to zkSync. zKSync has a great migration guide which can be helpful if you are planning to migrate your DApp to zkSync.","For Individuals: Individual first need to bridge their assets to zkSync via a bridge. zkSync has provided an official bridge for the same. Once bridged, assets can be used similar to any EVM based blockchain.","","With its growing list of DeFi projects and features, zkSync is quickly becoming one of the most important platforms for the DeFi ecosystem. The network has seen a massive bridging of assets on the network, with approximately $871 million USD worth of assets bridged so far.","Some of the DeFi projects that have announced their launch on zkSync are:","and hundreds of more protocols. The full and the latest list can be found on zkSync’s ecosystem page.","","Although ZKSync currently does not have a native token, the company has stated that there will be a token introduced in the future that will be used for staking and becoming a validator on the network. Users may also be rewarded with an airdrop, similar to the Optimism airdrop. This native token will likely play an important role in the ecosystem and offer additional benefits to users of the network.","For the best chance of receiving the zkSync airdrop we suggest you read our guide on how to get zkSync Airdrop.","","zkSync is being designed and developed by Matter Labs, a Berlin based startup with a vision to scale Ethereum.

This surge is spurring innovation throughout the industry.","Amidst this excitement, Real-World assets (RWA) tokenization has rapidly gained popularity in 2024. RWA tokenization transforms tangible assets like real estate, art, and precious metals into virtual investment options. This fresh approach offers many benefits, including lower costs, more liquidity, and quicker settlements.","Despite the growth potential, historical returns from such ventures have often been modest. But now, MAIV has stepped in to change that.","For those wanting to diversify their investment mix, platforms like MAIV (Multi Asset Investment Vehicle) provide valuable help. MAIV stands out from the crowd. While many companies tokenize real estate and distribute rental revenue through ownership-based tokens, MAIV has a different approach. It sees this market as risky, with possibly lower returns.","MAIV gives investors a unique chance to benefit from the development of RWAs while reducing risks and maximizing profits. By giving developers the upfront capital needed for land acquisition, MAIV ensures that the assets’ inherent value secures investors’ money. This special model lets investors access profitable finance options and speeds up property projects for developers.","The platform’s main token is $MAIV.","What’s so appealing about MAIV? It offers market-leading returns previously out of reach for most investors. With yearly profits of up to 20%, MAIV provides an entry point to top-quality, early-stage property investments. By simplifying the capital-raising process, developers linked with MAIV can also speed up project timelines while cutting expenses.","In the past, these investment opportunities were mainly for the wealthy, leaving out the average investor. But with MAIV, everyone gets a shot at investing. MAIV opens doors for all, offering access to profitable, secure investments supported by real-world assets. This levels the playing field and gives a wider range of people chances for financial growth.","Unlike traditional methods, MAIV lets users profit from RWAs’ development, stressing stability and higher returns for investors. This is done by providing secure investments backed by tangible assets.","MAIV provides developers with initial capital for land acquisition while keeping a lien on the land during the project. Users get access to these chances, enjoying market-leading returns that are typically out of reach for the average investor. Investments are secured by the land’s value, with developers guaranteeing returns via contract.","Transparency, integrity, and investor satisfaction are vital for MAIV. It acts as a bridge between developers and investors, fostering financial growth for both parties.","In today’s bullish market, it’s a great time to explore RWA projects and grab the growing opportunities. As traditional investment methods evolve, MAIV emerges as an innovative option, bridging the gap between investors and developers.","The MAIV token is gearing up for its launch on Fjord Foundry as a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool. This exciting development opens doors for investors, offering access to profitable, secure investments backed by real-world assets.","The rise of Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) marks a new era in fundraising, especially at Fjord Foundry. LP Curators oversee projects, while token prices adjust based on demand. The final token price is kept secret until the LBP ends, adding excitement to participation. As the pool size grows, so does the token price, maximizing returns for contributors.","LBPs on Fjord Foundry are overseen by curators who carefully vet projects, collaborate with teams, present projects to audiences, and select projects based on strict quality standards.","This convergence of innovative investment vehicles promises to transform the investment landscape, empowering individuals to diversify their portfolios, seize emerging opportunities, and drive financial growth. As excitement grows and anticipation builds, now is the time to embrace the future of investment with MAIV and LBPs. Get ready for a journey of financial growth and innovation like never before.

Compatible with EMV standards, zkSync allows for faster and more cost-effective transactions while preserving the security of the Ethereum network. zkSync is created and run by Matter lab. The protocol has raised $469 million in funding from prominent investors.","","zkSync (pronounced “zee-kay-sync”) is a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution that implements Zero Knowledge rollups, a much-awaited scaling solution proposed by Vitalik Buterin for Ethereum. It is one of the first protocols to build a fully EVM-compatible zk-rollup, allowing developers to easily deploy their current Ethereum DApps to zkSync with minimal modifications.","Designed by Matter Labs, zkSync has raised $469 million in funding and has already bridged almost $871 million worth of assets to its network, making it one of the most promising Ethereum scaling solutions.","","zkSync is an EVM-compatible network that is part of a family of Layer-2 scaling solutions. Specifically, zkSync implements zero-knowledge proof cryptography, which allows for transactions to be executed off-chain while still ensuring their validity through a valid cryptographic proof that is submitted to the main chain.","As zkSync is an EVM-compatible blockchain, developers can easily use it with little to no modification on their existing smart contracts. However, it’s important to note that zkSync makes some changes to the Ethereum bytecode, so developers may need to perform an additional compilation step when porting their application to zkSync.","With its implementation of zero-knowledge proof cryptography, zkSync offers a range of benefits for the Ethereum ecosystem, including faster transaction times, lower fees, and increased scalability.","","One major challenge that has plagued the blockchain industry from the start is scalability. To compete with traditional centralized payment networks, blockchains must be able to match their speed, but decentralization and security have made this difficult.","This challenge has been dubbed the “Blockchain Trilemma” which states that a blockchain can only have two out of three things: security, scalability, and decentralization. Popular blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have chosen to prioritize security and decentralization, which has left them struggling to keep up with the transaction throughput of traditional networks.","Many popular blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum focus on security and decentralization.","But if blockchains have to replace the legacy network, they have to match the the transaction throughput of the current systems.","Enter Layer 2 network – these networks build on top of an underlying blockchain protocol to improve speed and efficiency. By shifting the bulk of computation to a different network adjacent to the main network, the base layer is less congested and ultimately more scalable.","zkSync is an example of Layer 2 scaling solutions.","There are currently 5 types of layer-2 scaling solutions:","","A Rollup is a type of scaling solution for Ethereum that operates off the main Ethereum network. It works by bundling individual transactions into batches, which are then executed separately and the resulting data is posted to the main Ethereum network once all the transactions in the batch have been processed. This approach enables faster transaction processing while still ensuring the security of the Ethereum network.","There are currently two types of Rollups","zkSync is an example of ZK-Rollups.","","ZK Rollups are a specific type of Rollup solution for Ethereum that operates off-chain, where transactions are bundled together and processed outside the main Ethereum network. ZK Rollups use zero knowledge cryptography to provide a validity proof that proves the accuracy of the transaction without revealing any transaction details. This proof ensures that the changes made to the Ethereum network are a direct result of the transactions in the batch. This approach allows for faster processing times and increased privacy while maintaining the security and integrity of the Ethereum network.","zkSync is an example of zk-rollup based scaling solution for Ethereum.","","zkSync is a state-of-the-art Ethereum scaling solution that utilizes zero-knowledge rollups technology, which offers several benefits over traditional methods. With zkSync, users can enjoy lower gas fees and higher transaction throughput thanks to the use of zk-rollups. This cutting-edge approach to scaling has positioned zkSync as a promising solution for those seeking faster, more efficient, and cost-effective Ethereum transactions.","Here are a list of the top features and benefits of zkSync","","zkSync is pretty straightforward to use if you are familiar with other blockchains.","For Developers: Developers can instantly port their existing EVM compaitbale DApp to zkSync. zKSync has a great migration guide which can be helpful if you are planning to migrate your DApp to zkSync.","For Individuals: Individual first need to bridge their assets to zkSync via a bridge. zkSync has provided an official bridge for the same. Once bridged, assets can be used similar to any EVM based blockchain.","","With its growing list of DeFi projects and features, zkSync is quickly becoming one of the most important platforms for the DeFi ecosystem. The network has seen a massive bridging of assets on the network, with approximately $871 million USD worth of assets bridged so far.","Some of the DeFi projects that have announced their launch on zkSync are:","and hundreds of more protocols. The full and the latest list can be found on zkSync’s ecosystem page.","","Although ZKSync currently does not have a native token, the company has stated that there will be a token introduced in the future that will be used for staking and becoming a validator on the network. Users may also be rewarded with an airdrop, similar to the Optimism airdrop. This native token will likely play an important role in the ecosystem and offer additional benefits to users of the network.","For the best chance of receiving the zkSync airdrop we suggest you read our guide on how to get zkSync Airdrop.","","zkSync is being designed and developed by Matter Labs, a Berlin based startup with a vision to scale Ethereum.

The birds NFT is dropping their collection onto the Bitcoin’s NFT Ordinals Protocol with a $200,000 prize for one of the participants.","Moonbird NFTs attracted nearly $500 million in sales last April. Users now will have a chance to enter the promising Birds NFT collection on Bitcoin via the recently introduced Ordinals protocol.","After a meteoric rise in popularity, the BAYC monkeys have solidified themselves as one of the top-selling NFT collections, with a whopping value of $1.3M. The descendant of the final collection of NFTs has now been released on the Bitcoin blockchain, drawing lots of attention from the NFT enthusiasts worldwide.","The Birds NFT collection is about to pick up the trend, dropping their collection onto the Bitcoin’s NFT Ordinals Protocol with a $200,000 prize for one of the participants. Birds BTC is a collection of unique utility-enabled PFPs that feature a rich, diverse and unique pool of rarity-powered traits on the Ordinals protocol. The collection is bound to live up to its global name and maintain its unchallenged leadership in the NFT “PFP” space, spinning off as Bitcoin NFTs.","Consisting of 10,000 PFPs, the collection comes with a special set of rare traits available on Ordinals. With design elements comparable to projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, it’s no surprise this Bitcoin-based series has sparked excitement in the entire NFT space.","The world of Bitcoin and NFTs is getting more interesting by the minute. The demand for a reunion with the “root of all blockchains” has sent its growth skyrocketing, proving this could be another sign pointing towards the bull market. The ordinals protocol has been shaking up the crypto marketplace ever since making its debut in 2014. However, it was only two weeks ago that things truly started to heat up when NFTs found their way onto Bitcoin’s blockchain thanks to the nifty code updates of SegWit and Taproot. Adding even more fuel to the fire, Ordinals recently made headlines again as they debuted a collection called ‘Ordinal Punks,’ taking inspiration from CryptoPunks’ iconic designs. The Birds NFT collection is the next to join the fast-growing Bitcoin NFT boom. Since the Moonbirds launch on April 16th, 2022 on Ethereum, it has already raked in a whopping $500 million from the buyers, with an impressive first 48 hours being bolstered by over $200 million alone. Ethereum put up quite a fight, but now bets are firmly placed against them as speculators make bold predictions of even greater success for its Bitcoin “spin-offs” down the line. With record revenues and CryptoSlam placing this project second only to their bestselling counterpart, it’s not a surprise that its titanic popularity has attracted some high-profile fans such as Beeple, Tim Ferriss, Garry Vee and Alex Ohanian, among many others. Its 10k utility-enabled PFP tokens provide additional value along with unique mint features, making sure that the Moonbirds stay flying high. After the first 500 Bird NFTs are purchased, $5,000 will be split among 32 purchasers. Once the 10,000 Bird NFTs are sold out, $200,000 will be awarded to a random purchaser. Purchasing more than 10 Bird NFTs in one transaction applies a discount of 5 up to 20%.","Discuss this news on our Telegram Community.

By getting in on the ground floor of these startups, investors can reap the benefits of their growth and success as the industry continues to evolve. According to the Business Research Company, the global blockchain services market is projected to grow from $3.28 billion in 2022 to $4.7 billion in 2023 to a staggering $19.76 billion by 2027.","Established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum have long dominated the space. However, new blockchain-based projects are emerging, challenging their dominance and paving the way for more incredible innovation and competition.","While Bitcoin is primarily a store of value and payment system, and Ethereum focuses on smart contracts and decentralized applications, new projects offer a more comprehensive range of use cases and capabilities. For example, some projects focus on privacy and security, while others develop new solutions for supply chain management, data storage, and decentralized finance.","This article will highlight some crypto companies poised to shape the industry’s future in 2023. These companies use cutting-edge technologies and business models to address some of the industry’s biggest challenges, such as scalability, security, and adoption.","QMALL is an accessible and simple cryptocurrency trading platform. It has sophisticated trading perks and the ability to trade cryptocurrencies quickly.

Bridging is quite easy, so don’t miss out on this opportunity to potentially receive free zkSync tokens.","How To Bridge To ZkSync","1. Go to ZkSync Lite , whieh is the official bridge by the zKSync team.","","2. Click Top Up, scroll down and select Bridges.","","3. Enter the amount you want to bridge. (The recommended amount is 0.1 ETH at least)","","4. Follow on screen instructions, and you would see your assets on your zKSync L2 wallet. That’s it. Repeat the step until you have successfully bridged at least 1 ETH to zkSync.","One of the criteria for the Arbitrum airdrop was transaction frequency and contract interactions. Its safe to assume, zkSync would also track your transaction frequency and contract interactions. One of the best way to increase the transaction frequency and contract interaction is by using a decentralized exchange, and for that we recommend ZigZag exchange by the same team of zkSync.","After bridging your assets to ZKSync, go to https://trade.zigzag.exchange/, and make a few trades. Make 1-2 trades daily, for the best chance to get a higher reward.","You can track your current transactions, go to zkSync’s Blockchain explorer ( https://zkscan.io ) to see how many transactions you have made. It is recommended that you make at least 50-100 transactions on each wallet.","ZigZag Exchange","If you are a developers, or a DAO consider developing and deploying applications on the zkSync Network. Network’s such as zkSync need more applications on their network, and to incentivize further development, applications that develop on a network have the highest chances of getting an airdrop.","ZKSync Developers Guide: https://era.zksync.io/docs/dev/building-on-zksync/contracts/contract-deployment.html","Majority of the methods mentioned above require some form of transactions. If you are interested in some free airdrops, you can take part in ZKSync’s Crew Quests.","There are around 18 quests available (at the time of writing) for you to take part in. Please note, since Crew Quests are free to do, there will be a lot of users (including bots) taking part, so chances of getting an aridrop solely from Crew3 quests are pretty slim. But since its free, no harm in trying.","Steps To Take Part in zkSync Crew Quests","1. Go to ZKSync’s Official Crew3 page: https://crew3.xyz/c/zksync/questboard","","2. Connect your wallet","3. Do the Community and Social Media tasks.","That’s it. You can create multiple wallets to do the tasks.","Discuss this news on our Telegram Community.

While DeFi projects still enjoy a significant market and robust demand from the current user requirements’ standpoint, blockchain games are quickly regaining popularity among blockchain industry enthusiasts.","Comparable to DeFi’s growth trajectory, the industry’s creators and value-capturers are always the first in line to capitalize on new trends in the NFT sector. Versailles Heroes is a massively multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game with a grand epic background that has decided to join this new market trend following the return of blockchain games’ popularity. Versailles Heroes serves as an excellent value creator for NFT collectors as the project devotes itself to creating a blockchain game that players can effectively play.","According to their recent tweet, the Versailles Heroes NFT will soon November 25th be available on Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Before making its way to Binance, this exciting NFT project went live on OpenSea, Coinbase, the OKX NFT marketplace, and other well-known NFT marketplaces.","Incorporating GameFi, DeFi, NFT, and Metaverse aspects into a pure chain game, Versailles Heroes is built on the Ethereum to make use of its ecological prowess and technological effectiveness.","By using the open, fair, and decentralized features of DAO smart contracts, the developers of the blockchain game are quickly realizing its roadmap to offer a game that everyone can contribute to.","Versailles Heroes aims to strengthen the ecosystem by becoming a cutting-edge framework for game planning, design, and production, guaranteeing an exceptional experience of entertainment and gaming excitement, and using robust tools for effective player interaction and participation.","The Empire of Missihill, Empire of Dresk, Rothstein City, Azbanca, and the North Thousand Island are the five places that the game focuses on, with the Versailles continent from star wars serving as a clue. The diverse roles that these areas play in the game are based on their geography and the sorts of people that live there. Rothstein, for instance, is the birthplace of many heroes and the arena of the Versailles continent.","","With a deep storyline in place, classic games like Warcraft and League of Legends take a more visceral approach to developing game modes and settings for hero characters. Heroes and their weapons in the game are assigned certain roles, such as mages, assassins, marksmen, tanks, and support and so on. All these characters’ weapons are based on the NFT of ERC-721 standard, and each one has its own special qualities.","Versailles Heroes offers a variety of distinct game modes, such as the Practice Grounds, Deathmatch (4V4 Classic Match), Battle Royale Solo/Duos, Trophy Collection (4V4 Special Game), Inhibitor Rush(4V4 King’s Canyon), Battle Wager Mode, Custom Wager Mode, and so on to keep players involved and cater to a wide range of preferences.","When the game launches, players who buy NFT heroes or weapons, play in whatever mode they choose, and follow the rules may earn a lot of money.","Versailles Heroes has duo tokenomics which is a consistent economic model with the standard for blockchain games in the NFT space.","The NFT game has two tokens called MOH and VRH. While the former is used mostly for in-game circulation (purchasing gold, NFT, props, etc.), the latter is used to aid with DAO governance outside of the game (voting, pledging, trading, etc.).","Playing for gold is the primary source of MOH while pledging and voting are the primary sources of VRH, both of which may be bought and sold on the market. It is possible to exchange both on the market.","Users that want to speed up the mining of VRH may get Gas by burning MOH, and the quantity of VRH mined by users is calculated based on the weight of the whole network’s Gas, ensuring a more even distribution of MOH and VRH. By utilizing MOH as the form of Gas to boost VRH mining speed to up to 2.5 times is a major function of MOH outside of the game. It is a valuable application of in-game token which helps balance the circulation and avoid devaluation of MOH. The prices of both tokens are stabilized by limiting the expansion of the circulating disk in this manner.","Versailles Heroes classifies its characters and weapons into four tiers—common, rare, epic, and legendary—based on the difficulty level used to balance the game. Upgrading heroes is an essential component of the game since various levels of heroes and weapons receive varying privileges and token awards in battles, such as legendary-level heroes and weapons having access to additional combat fields or daily MOH rewards.","The game also features the ELO system and AI players considering the level restrictions. The ELO system will match players appropriately based on their game experience and win rate, pairing players with opponents of a similar level as far as possible to provide fairness and a positive gaming experience. New players will be paired with AI to lessen the complexity of the game.","After the launch of NFT trading marketplaces like OpenSea, Coinbase, and OKX, the development of the NFT MOBA Game Versailles Heroes has significantly accelerated to provide NFT owners and collectors with the game very soon.","Before the game testing begins, Versailles Heroes will officially release a mystery box worldwide. Those who buy it will have a chance to get legendary-level hero weapons and NFT heroes at random. Top heroes and weapons translate into high game income, therefore participating in mystery box sales allows early NFT adopters to make more profits than making a straight purchase from the NFT market.","When the game launches, the NFT project will shortly begin a round of IDO to give community investors a very cheap price, which, according to the prediction, could be the lowest price in the history of VRH. This is due to the game’s governance tokens, VRH, more than 70% will be distributed to community, ensuring a smooth start of DAO governance.","We predict that Versailles Heroes will become the next best chain game thanks to its massive game design, diversified gameplay, fair game regulations, and acceptable duo pass model, as well as its online NFT release on Coinbase, OpenSea, OKX, and other giants platforms.","Discuss this news on our Telegram Community.

In 2023, several cryptocurrency startups are poised for significant growth, making them excellent investment opportunities for savvy investors.","Investing in cryptocurrency startups can be a high-risk, high-reward endeavor, but the potential for significant returns is hard to ignore. By getting in on the ground floor of these startups, investors can reap the benefits of their growth and success as the industry continues to evolve. According to the Business Research Company, the global blockchain services market is projected to grow from $3.28 billion in 2022 to $4.7 billion in 2023 to a staggering $19.76 billion by 2027.","Established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum have long dominated the space. However, new blockchain-based projects are emerging, challenging their dominance and paving the way for more incredible innovation and competition.","While Bitcoin is primarily a store of value and payment system, and Ethereum focuses on smart contracts and decentralized applications, new projects offer a more comprehensive range of use cases and capabilities. For example, some projects focus on privacy and security, while others develop new solutions for supply chain management, data storage, and decentralized finance.","This article will highlight some crypto companies poised to shape the industry’s future in 2023. These companies use cutting-edge technologies and business models to address some of the industry’s biggest challenges, such as scalability, security, and adoption.","QMALL is an accessible and simple cryptocurrency trading platform.

QMALL, in particular, is working on an extensive product range and will unveil a major overhaul to its offerings later this year.","The XDC Network is among the Blockchain Network that is friendly to the natural world.

The XDPoS consensus assures that the production of XDC coins and maintaining a stable decentralized Network need the same amount of energy as a word processor. Additionally, it may be finished in seconds, making it a very time- and energy-efficient operation.","The amount of energy used to mine XDC is very low compared to that required to mine other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether. The XDC coin consumes a meager 0.000007446 TWh, equivalent to only 7,446 kWh of power.

This surge is spurring innovation throughout the industry.","Amidst this excitement, Real-World assets (RWA) tokenization has rapidly gained popularity in 2024. RWA tokenization transforms tangible assets like real estate, art, and precious metals into virtual investment options. This fresh approach offers many benefits, including lower costs, more liquidity, and quicker settlements.","Despite the growth potential, historical returns from such ventures have often been modest. But now, MAIV has stepped in to change that.","For those wanting to diversify their investment mix, platforms like MAIV (Multi Asset Investment Vehicle) provide valuable help. MAIV stands out from the crowd. While many companies tokenize real estate and distribute rental revenue through ownership-based tokens, MAIV has a different approach. It sees this market as risky, with possibly lower returns.","MAIV gives investors a unique chance to benefit from the development of RWAs while reducing risks and maximizing profits. By giving developers the upfront capital needed for land acquisition, MAIV ensures that the assets’ inherent value secures investors’ money. This special model lets investors access profitable finance options and speeds up property projects for developers.","The platform’s main token is $MAIV.","What’s so appealing about MAIV? It offers market-leading returns previously out of reach for most investors. With yearly profits of up to 20%, MAIV provides an entry point to top-quality, early-stage property investments. By simplifying the capital-raising process, developers linked with MAIV can also speed up project timelines while cutting expenses.","In the past, these investment opportunities were mainly for the wealthy, leaving out the average investor. But with MAIV, everyone gets a shot at investing. MAIV opens doors for all, offering access to profitable, secure investments supported by real-world assets. This levels the playing field and gives a wider range of people chances for financial growth.","Unlike traditional methods, MAIV lets users profit from RWAs’ development, stressing stability and higher returns for investors. This is done by providing secure investments backed by tangible assets.","MAIV provides developers with initial capital for land acquisition while keeping a lien on the land during the project. Users get access to these chances, enjoying market-leading returns that are typically out of reach for the average investor. Investments are secured by the land’s value, with developers guaranteeing returns via contract.","Transparency, integrity, and investor satisfaction are vital for MAIV. It acts as a bridge between developers and investors, fostering financial growth for both parties.","In today’s bullish market, it’s a great time to explore RWA projects and grab the growing opportunities. As traditional investment methods evolve, MAIV emerges as an innovative option, bridging the gap between investors and developers.","The MAIV token is gearing up for its launch on Fjord Foundry as a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool. This exciting development opens doors for investors, offering access to profitable, secure investments backed by real-world assets.","The rise of Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) marks a new era in fundraising, especially at Fjord Foundry. LP Curators oversee projects, while token prices adjust based on demand. The final token price is kept secret until the LBP ends, adding excitement to participation. As the pool size grows, so does the token price, maximizing returns for contributors.","LBPs on Fjord Foundry are overseen by curators who carefully vet projects, collaborate with teams, present projects to audiences, and select projects based on strict quality standards.","This convergence of innovative investment vehicles promises to transform the investment landscape, empowering individuals to diversify their portfolios, seize emerging opportunities, and drive financial growth. As excitement grows and anticipation builds, now is the time to embrace the future of investment with MAIV and LBPs. Get ready for a journey of financial growth and innovation like never before. The future of investment is here, full of endless possibilities.","Discuss this news on our Telegram Community.
