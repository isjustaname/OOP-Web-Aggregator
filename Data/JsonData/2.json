Jackson previously co-founded Doctor On Demand.","","","Employment markets should be two-sided affairs but are often parceled out to third parties, Jackson said. Those parties often fail at sourcing top tech talent and charge large cuts for placing candidates, and are particularly poorly adapted to the strains of an increasingly remote workforce.","","","Braintrust flips the idea on its head by placing candidates in a pool with employers and creating a structure for interaction based on the Braintrust Token, Jackson said.","","","The token allows users to set governance parameters for the platform and is paid out based on actions, such as a successful referral.","","","�It�s not a financial token � it�s not meant to be monetized,� Jackson explained. �You can use it to decide what the rules are, like, �Should we let people in with this qualification or should we go to this category?� or, �What fees should we charge clients and talent?��","","","Based on Ethereum�s ERC-20 token standard, Braintrust�s governance model is a variant of Compound�s.

Unlike a bank, it only borrows and mainly lends cryptocurrency, and it does not have government deposit insurance. The company claims to have gathered a total of more than $1 billion worth of crypto deposits as of June.","As an example of its high lending standards, Mashinsky said Celsius Network strictly demands collateral when making a loan.","�When you�re using any other platforms that are like Celsius, what you care about is, who is the borrower?� Mashinksy said. �Is the lender doing non-collateralized loans? Celsius does not do non-collateralized loans. � Celsius will not do that because that would be taking too much risk on your behalf.�","The statement was at odds with what Celsius� own representative had told CoinDesk just a few days before.","In response to a question from CoinDesk, Anastasia Golovina, an external spokesperson for Celsius Network at the Ditto PR agency, confirmed the company also makes uncollateralized loans, on what she described as a limited basis.","�Celsius� total uncollateralized loans are less than a fraction of 1 percent out of tens of thousands of loans issued since 2018,� Golovina told CoinDesk by email on July 13, referring to the number of loans but not the dollar volume. �All of these were normal size loans and were done to institutions with billions of dollars in equity.�","When subsequently asked about the dollar volume of the uncollateralized loans and about Mashinsky\u0027s denial of their existence on the AMA, Golovina did not provide a response.","Read more: Crypto Lending 101","Even if small, the uncollateralized lending is one of several salient items that Celsius has downplayed or not shared with depositors.","Celsius, which has raised close to $20 million in the past two months on the crowdfunding platform BnkTotheFuture (including $10 million from stablecoin issuer Tether), is a major player in a budding corner of the crypto industry.","In the past year, lending activity has mushroomed as some holders sought to earn a yield on their assets, others sought to raise cash without selling their coins and market makers borrowed to fill orders quickly.","The phenomenon could potentially improve liquidity and price discovery for crypto assets. (Disclosure: Another crypto lender, Genesis Capital, is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.)","But like all lending, the crypto kind carries risk � and Celsius may be taking more of it than depositors fully realize.","Whatever the amount of unsecured lending in which Celsius engages, the majority of Celsius� loans appears to be collateralized. To borrow $1,000 with a 0.7% interest rate, for example, a trader needs to pledge around 0.43 BTC of collateral to Celsius as of this writing, and if the value of that collateral dips, the loan is subject to margin calls.","But Celsius has also at times invested deposits in perpetual swaps, futures-like contracts with no expiry date, people familiar with Celsius� business said.","Reportedly pioneered by the BitMEX exchange, perpetual swaps settle to an index periodically, letting traders maintain their positions without rolling them over. This activity, one source said, increases Celsius� vulnerability to brutal sell-offs like the one bitcoin endured in mid-March, which led to a spike in forced unwindings of such contracts at BitMex.","�The problem is that some of that is done on BitMEX, and you take March 12 again and BitMEX closes down through the margin-call floor � the extra 2% profit is now negative 10% profit,� this person said, describing a hypothetical scenario.","Read more: Genesis CEO Details �Black Thursday� Chaos in Q1 Lending Report","Celsius denied investing in perpetual swaps.","�Our business is to lend out coins to institutions,� Mashinsky said in an email to CoinDesk. �Celsius lends mostly to large institutions and sometimes to exchanges, both provide us with collateral.�","A serial entrepreneur who helped pioneer voice-over-internet-protocol (VOIP) technology, Mashinsky founded Celsius in early 2018. Like many in the crypto space, he touts his service as a way to democratize finance. An August 2019 pitch deck obtained by CoinDesk says the company�s vision is to provide �fair interest income for 7 billion people.�","Also potentially concerning to depositors, people with knowledge of the matter said, is that Celsius lends out portions of the collateral borrowers hand over.","An over-the-counter desk trader likened this practice, known as rehypothecation, to the way subprime loans were repackaged and sold as mortgage-backed securities and then resold as collateralized debt obligations in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.","Because of rehypothecation, which the trader said several crypto lending platforms are engaging in, he is seeing many clients pull out of lending and move toward options contracts.","Another source familiar with Celsius� business said the lender�s rehypothecation of loan collateral is also why crypto miners don�t take out loans from the firm � they don�t want to end up unable to access crypto they mined.","In response to questions about rehypothecation of collateral, Golovina said Celsius won�t �discuss our best business practice and the competitive advantage of our business model.�","Read more: $25 Million in 2 Weeks: BlockFi Booms as Bitcoin and Ether Investors Seek Interest","In its terms of use, Celsius reserves the right to re-hypothecate customers� assets, but it�s ambiguous whether the passage refers solely to depositors� funds or to borrowers� pledged collateral as well. �In consideration for the rewards earned on your Account and the use of our Services,� the document says, �you grant Celsius the right � to pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend or otherwise transfer or use any amount of such Digital Assets � for any period of time.�","Before the aforementioned recent $19.2 million investment from Tether and BnkToTheFuture, Celsius raised its startup capital through an initial coin offering (ICO) in early 2018. The company swapped its CEL token for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the largest and second-largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively.","However, Celsius did not convert the crypto it received in the ICO to fiat until after the market tanked, which caused it to lose about half the value of the proceeds, people familiar with the sale said.","Public information supports this claim. In September 2019, Mashinsky told CoinDesk the ICO was valued at $50 million. But financial statements filed with the U.K. registrar Companies House in May 2020 show proceeds of only $25 million as of Feb. 28, 2019. (Celsius is based in Hoboken, N.J., and privately held, but has a subsidiary in London, and is thus required to file financials with the registrar.)","Celsius chalked up the difference to an accounting practice, but acknowledged it did not convert the crypto to fiat in the same month that it was raised.","�While Celsius reported an ICO worth $50 million, when the coins converted to fiat the value of the coins dropped as the market dropped in accordance,� Golovina said. �In addition, for tax reasons, we recognize revenues over several years as we use the funds to build the product.�","Read more: Here�s Why Interest Rates on Cryptocurrencies Could Be a Game-Changer","Celsius recognizes ICO proceeds as revenue only when it converts the funds to dollars, she said, again citing tax reasons.","It waited to convert the crypto to dollars because the firm identifies as a �HODLer,� she added, using crypto argot for a long-term investor.","CORRECTION (July 29, 20:20 UTC): An earlier version of this article overstated Celsius� recent funding round. It was $19.2 million crowdfunded on BnkToTheFuture including, not in addition to, $10 million from Tether.

This was most certainly seen as a stepping-stone in bringing the crypto and traditional financial markets together � offering a regulated pathway for investment in digital assets.","title":"Crypto IRAs Take Center Stage as Investors Seek Retirement Wealth in the Bull Run","content":["In Q1 2024, the SEC in its landmark judgment approved the listing and trading of a number of spot bitcoin ETFs � including those by BlackRock, Vanguard and Franklin Templeton. This was most certainly seen as a stepping-stone in bringing the crypto and traditional financial markets together � offering a regulated pathway for investment in digital assets.","But still not many investors from both Web3 and traditional investment backgrounds seem to fully understand the key differences between investing in bitcoin versus investing in bitcoin ETFs.","When you purchase bitcoin you gain full ownership and control over your assets (lest we forget with unlimited trading hours and potentially lower fees). But there are some downsides to be aware of. First, you need technical blockchain wallet know-how and an understanding of cryptoeconomics. Secondly, and more importantly, you can�t include your bitcoin investment in traditional retirement plans like 401(k)s.","Investing in bitcoin ETFs can also be advantageous for a few reasons: Ease of access, simplified investment, regulatory and security benefits, market integration, liquidity, diversification and potential tax benefits. The main downside is that you don�t really personally possess actual bitcoin. Add to this high management fees, operational costs, market hours limitation and potential tracking errors.","But what if there was a third option? One that combines the positives of both � direct bitcoin ownership and bitcoin ETFs � while also addressing their respective negatives? If you live in the United States, chances are that you have already heard of an IRA (short for �Individual Retirement Account�), a long-term, tax-advantaged savings account designed for individuals with earned income to save for retirement.","In recent years, IRAs have gone on to cover a broad spectrum � including cryptocurrencies, known as Crypto IRAs � a self-directed Individual Retirement Account (SDIRA) which allows investors to include digital currencies like bitcoin, ethereum and others in their retirement portfolios. And as more investors are flocking to Crypto IRAs in the middle of this ongoing bull run, it\u0027s quite evident that the future of retirement planning is becoming increasingly intertwined with the world of digital assets.","Investing in a Crypto IRA can offer several benefits and advantages: Tax-advantaged growth (either tax-deferred or tax-free), digital asset security and diversification. By incorporating cryptocurrencies into retirement savings, investors are bullish on adding this decentralized asset class to their portfolios � potentially maximizing the compounding effect of investments while minimizing immediate tax liabilities.","Let\u0027s consider a simple example to illustrate the tax benefits. Say you buy $25,000 worth of bitcoin and it increases to $65,000. That\u0027s a $40,000 gain. While this sounds great, the issue is that these profits are now subject to capital gains tax. In comparison, if you buy $25,000 worth of bitcoin in a Roth IRA (with tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and its value increases to $65,000 you\u0027ve still made a $40,000 gain.","And the best part is that when you sell in the future, you\u0027re not subject to capital gains tax and you can keep all of your profits.","But for crypto IRAs to pave the way for the future of retirement investing, we need a trustworthy, reliable and user-friendly approach. We need a solution that not only simplifies the process of buying and selling crypto through tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but also keeps costs low, stays transparent and makes investing in crypto assets with IRAs a walk in the park.","One such platform is iTrustCapital, led by CEO Kevin Maloney, a former compliance officer at the $2.5 trillion asset management firm PIMCO, and best known for working closely with regulatory agencies like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).","The platform has seen a surge in activity recently, with both an influx of new accounts being funded and a large number of holding accounts coming back to life, no doubt after reigniting their interest in the crypto space. Clients who were inactive during the bear market are now returning in droves � not just to check their accounts but to start transacting again.","Clients enjoy the flexibility of being able to buy and sell digital assets 24/7 � unlike ETFs which are only available for trading during market hours. This round-the-clock access allows investors to make decisions based on real-time market movements and their own investment strategies.","iTrustCapital offers a wide range of digital assets for investors to choose from � including popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum and a variety of altcoins. Such an approach allows investors to diversify their portfolios within the crypto space � potentially mitigating risk and capitalizing on emerging opportunities.","Another significant advantage is the ability to buy and sell within the account without creating a taxable event. Clients can buy and sell different digital assets and only incur a small fee, similar to other exchanges. This feature is particularly valuable for investors looking to rebalance their portfolios or take advantage of market fluctuations without worrying about immediate tax implications.","iTrustCapital also offers the option to move assets from other crypto IRAs into its platform. This flexibility allows investors who may be dissatisfied with the limited offerings or high fees from their current provider, to consolidate their crypto holdings under one roof. Thus, investors can enjoy an extensive range of digital assets and a competitive fee structure with iTrustCapital.","iTrustCapital has leveraged the regulated infrastructure of experienced third party compliance and custodial services in Web3. The company has done so by evaluating potential partners based on its deep domain knowledge, clean charters, excellent technology platforms and outstanding experience teams committed to doing the right thing. Ultimately, the company uses a regulated, state-chartered trust company to hold the self-directed IRAs and custody client assets.","The goal is to prioritize customer trust and safety around the purchase and safeguarding of their digital assets. In order to ensure reliability and peace of mind, iTrustCapital never takes custody of its clients\u0027 assets, nor does it leverage those assets for profit.","Moreover, iTrustCapital holds clients\u0027 assets \"off-balance sheet,\" meaning that client assets are never actually recorded on the company\u0027s financial statements. By not including those assets, the company\u0027s business activities, its financial ratios and its overall leverage strategy remain unaffected by the amount of assets held for their clients. This approach demonstrates iTrustCapital\u0027s commitment to being fully transparent with its customer base and to continuously follow ethical practices.","Including iTrustCapital in your IRA strategy means knowing that your assets are safe and secure with a company that puts the highest value on customer trust.","Looking ahead, it\u0027s plausible that Crypto IRAs will become an increasingly common component of retirement portfolios. More investors are recognizing the potential benefits of including digital assets in their retirement portfolios � whether for diversification, long-term growth or as a hedge against traditional market volatility.","As younger generations who are more comfortable with digital assets begin to plan for their financial futures, platforms like iTrustCapital, through its wide range of digital assets and the security of a regulated custodian, will be well-positioned to capitalize on this growing demand for Crypto IRAs.","If you are looking for more information on how to start your crypto IRA with iTrustCapital, visit the website: https://www.itrustcapital.com/. iTrustCapital does not provide legal, investment or tax advice.

FTT futures had a relatively lesser $27 million in liquidations � implying the steep drop was mostly driven by sales of spot tokens.","Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader�s leveraged position because of a partial or total loss of the trader�s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).","FTX came under scrutiny following a CoinDesk report last week that found the balance sheet of Alameda Research, a crypto trading unit owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, who also owns FTX, was full of FTX�s native FTT tokens.

Rival Binance, which held over $500 million of FTT on its books, started to offload its holdings � which culminated in a 24-hour-long drama that ended with Binance signing an intent to acquire FTX, which is now considered by many to be insolvent.","Such market dynamics spooked crypto markets as traders reacted to possible contagion risks.

While bitcoin laid the foundation for this market, the narrative has since expanded to include thousands of diverse tokens collectively valued in trillions of dollars. This growth underscores the dynamic evolution of the cryptocurrency ecosystem beyond bitcoin\u0027s pioneering role.","As this asset class continues to burgeon, investors encounter a fundamental challenge: how to navigate the vast and varied landscape of cryptocurrencies effectively. While the allure of comprehensive exposure to the cryptocurrency market remains strong, achieving this goal presents hurdles around liquidity, wallet management, allocation weightings and ongoing portfolio maintenance through market cycles.","The need to measure, invest and trade in the digital asset ecosystem extending beyond bitcoin is underscored by several factors:","Diversification: While bitcoin remains the cryptocurrency pioneer, the market now boasts thousands of alternative digital assets.

Every one of the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization is assigned to an industry, defined by DACS. Then at least one industry is assigned to an industry group and finally at least one industry group is assigned to a sector.","Currently, there are six sectors defined by DACS including Currency, Computing, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), Digitization, Entertainment and Smart Contract Platform. The Digitization sector is the smallest sector in DACS with nine assets representing 0.1% of the digital asset market worth approximately $1.4 billion in market capitalization as of April 30, 2022.","Exhibit 1: CoinDesk Indices DACS","In this paper, we describe the Digitization sector in further detail by discussing its definition, constituents, and significance in the broader digital asset space.","Defining the Digitization sector","Digitization refers to the transformation of publicly verifiable ownership, identity, and immutability enabled by blockchain technology. With the growth of the digital economy and crypto native ecosystems, participants increasingly need a way to express their digital identity to facilitate fast, verifiable and censorship-resistant transactions on the blockchain. Although Digitization is currently the smallest sector in DACS, it has a wide range of use cases, including helping brands establish digital identity, accept crypto payments directly, and allow patients to digitize their medical records to enable faster exchange of information without loss of privacy.","The DACS Glossary defines the Digitization sector as follows:","Digitization refers to the process by which real world documents, contracts, public names, etc. are uploaded to a blockchain for the purpose of transparency, publicly verifiable ownership, and immutability. Proof of ownership, identity and authenticity are all valuable traits that are made possible by blockchain technology.","Industry groups and industries inside the Digitization sector","The Digitization industry is comprised of one industry group. The industry group is also comprised of one industry. As the digital economy grows, it is likely the digitization sector will expand with more industry groups and industries as the use cases become more specialized.","Exhibit 2: Industry Groups under Digitization Sector","CoinDesk Indices, 5/13/2022. Market capitalization data is based on 4/30/2022.","Major assets inside the Digitization sector","There are currently nine assets in the Digitization Sector. The largest three tokens in the sector are: Ethereum Name Service (ENS) 1, Braintrust (BTRST) 2 and MediBloc (MED) 3 representing 28.9%, 22.7% and 13.9% of the sector market capitalization, respectively, as of April 30.","Exhibit 3: Assets Inside the DACS Digitization Sector","Conclusion","The Digitization sector includes projects that enable the digital transformation of real-world documents, contracts, and identities. With blockchain technology, proof of ownership and authenticity can be achieved in a transparent, secure and trustless fashion. Although Digitization is currently the smallest sector in DACS, it is likely to grow with the increasing demand for establishing identities in the digital economy.","References","1. Ethereum Name Service (ENS) allows user to convert an alphanumeric public address to a recognizable domain name on the blockchain. ENS empowers brands to create their digital identity (ex: Adidas.eth, Nike.eth, Puma.eth) to allow for crypto payments.

The theme, �Unlocking Human Potential,� highlighted the role that streamlined, low-cost and flexible payments play in empowerment and opportunity. The takeaway is that blockchain technology is about more than issuing tokens and trading assets. It is also about utility, helping individuals and businesses around the world connect and transact with each other.","To that end, the SDF showcased the progress made by the Stellar ecosystem in building the tools to make global disbursements and remittances cheaper, faster and more transparent. In a gorgeous setting and in front of an audience of international organizations, small businesses, developers and users of all types, the SDF introduced new upgrades and affiliations, and highlighted the evolving functionality and transparency of its unique distributed system.","Below, we highlight some of the recent innovations that featured heavily in presentations and conversations at the event. More detail can be found on stellar.org.","Many of the Meridian announcements were to do with the upgrade and expansion of developer tools, such as the Anchor Platform, the Stellar Wallet SDK and the Stellar Asset Sandbox.","One of the key announcements at the Meridian event was the expansion of the Anchor Platform suite of tools to further facilitate the implementation of on- and off-ramps between fiat and crypto assets. Via Anchor, companies can now access low-cost and fast cross-border payment rails, and can benefit from streamlined conversion to local fiat currencies via two on- and off-ramp standards. This brings greater flexibility and efficiency to local solutions in one integration, and closes the gap between blockchain solutions and real world utility.","Dozens of startups building with Anchor were in attendance, showcasing their implementations and services. One example was Flutterwave, a Nigeria-based fintech providing payment infrastructure across Africa, which highlighted how the Anchor platform powered its remittance services. Another was Banxa, an Australia-based financial technology platform focusing on Web3 services, which shared details of how the Anchor platform enables it to connect to ecosystem wallets and a broader universe of users.","The Meridian 2023 event also saw the announcement of the new Stellar Wallet SDK (software development kit), a suite of self-service tools designed to simplify the construction of solutions that solve local and global needs. Businesses can now easily spin up Stellar-based wallets that access the network without piecemeal customization and without requiring deep technical expertise.","The Stellar Asset Sandbox, a testing ground for exploring asset tokenization on the Stellar network without intricate coding, also received new features. These include custodial solutions, expanded token management, role-based access control and treasury services. It will also support Stellar�s smart contract network Soroban, currently in testnet. This enables users to engage with and builders to trial a wide range of DeFi applications.","Other key features of the event involved significant partnerships and products:","The Stellar stablecoin system expanded in terms of reach and flexibility. Stablecoin issuer Circle announced the launch of its Euro stablecoin EURC on Stellar to broaden the utility of fast, global blockchain-based payments. Users have been able to send Circle�s dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin around the Stellar network since 2021, supported by MoneyGram and key crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Coinme. Now, users can also use Circle�s euro-pegged EURC to facilitate conversion into fiat, depending on their location.","Building on its successful partnership with the SDF in connecting fiat on- and off-ramps to the convenience of the Stellar blockchain, global payments company MoneyGram recently announced plans to launch a non-custodial digital wallet built on Stellar. This is expected to go live in the first quarter of 2024, and will enhance the security of digital asset holdings for users around the world while offering the same level of fast-payment convenience.","The Meridian event also served to showcase the recent upgrade to the Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP), a payments interface that runs on the Stellar blockchain.","SDP enables blockchain-based batch payments around the world for remittances, payroll, contractor payments and the distribution of aid. Today, recipients across Ukraine receive disbursements of aid directly to their mobile devices thanks to the platform�s use by humanitarian organizations such as the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.","As of August, the SDP platform is now open source, enabling anyone, anywhere to build the services they believe the network should have. What�s more, app developers and users can take advantage of over 300,000 fiat on- and off-ramps in more than 180 countries around the globe.","In September, the SDF revealed the first third-party custodian to connect with the SDP disbursement platform: Zodia Custody, an institutional-grade digital asset custodian majority-owned by the multinational bank Standard Chartered. Zodia�s participation enables organizations that don�t want to set up blockchain integrations to benefit from the low-cost and transparent ease of sending bulk disbursements to thousands of recipients at once, with the assurance of secure asset custody solutions.","The versatility of the SDP was further showcased by the announcement that two new wallets, Beans App and Boss Money, have integrated with the platform.","Beans App is a Netherlands-based, remittance-focused service that offers savings accounts as well as instant and free cross-border transfers in over 50 currencies with QR support and a simple interface.","Boss Money, owned by US-based fintech and telcom provider IDT Corporation, is a pan-African, Stellar-based wallet that does not require a smartphone, enabling US senders to reach a broader demographic.","With these integrations, users of Beans and Boss can interact with an even broader audience, reaching any SDP user, anywhere. And any SDP user can send to Beans and Boss users, even if the sender doesn�t have the relevant app installed. This broadens the range of potential services for businesses and individuals to include aid disbursements, saving and investing initiatives, payroll, payments to suppliers and more.","Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the Meridian event, however, was the passionate drive to improve opportunity and financial access for everyone. The optimism and determination rippled through the venue, on stage, in the hallways, in the breakout rooms and by the coffee tables, as attendees focused their attention and vision on real-world blockchain utility.","The platforms and protocols developed by the SDF using Stellar blockchain technology have created a flexible set of tools for builders to amplify. The big-name partnerships, well as the variety of integrated applications, broaden the potential utility even further.","The past year in the Stellar ecosystem has been one of careful user-focused expansion. Since the coming year will bring more development, more applications and even more cross-industry collaboration, Meridian 2024 is likely to be even more uplifting."],"create_date":"2023-11-17T17:21:05.726Z","tag":"","author":"CoinDesk Staff"}

The investment will be used to grow Moonlighting\u0027s user base and to integrate its existing infrastructure with EOS.","\"We have been exploring blockchain protocols since the end of 2017 and [have] chosen EOSIO due to its ability to scale transaction processing, maintain low transaction costs and enable ease of user account management,\" Moonlighting CEO Jeff Tennery told CoinDesk.","Stepping back, Block.one raised an estimated $4 billion in a yearlong initial coin offering that ended in 2018, using those funds to develop the EOSIO software on which the EOS blockchain is run. Block.one also invested in funders who would support applications meant to run on the new blockchain, most famously in Mike Novogratz�s Galaxy Digital. The FinLab EOS VC fund is a similar effort.","�We believe that Moonlighting contains the three key traits you look for in a decentralized application: real customers, real traction and a bona fide use case for blockchain technology,\" Paul Grotowski, COO of EOS VC, said in a press release.","Germany\u0027s FinLab AG has been investing in financial technology since 2005. FinLab board member Stefan Schuetze said in a release that people at his firm \"believe they will be one of the early winners to validate blockchain.�","Integrating with Web 3.0 technology is a strategic shift for Moonlighting.","\"We decided that we want our users to be able to port their profile to any platform and provide them a simple way to use their Moonlighting profile wherever they chose to use it,\" Tennery said via email. \"The gig economy is so fragmented, and our plan is to let freelancers control the use of their profile and provide a single sign-on, aggregated gateway.\"","Critically, however, the company is not copying all of its data to the blockchain in plain text. Instead, it\u0027s securing the data using hashes that still rely on Moonlighting\u0027s centralized database to decrypt.","\"The hashes on the blockchain provides audit-ability and validity to our freelancer profiles maintained off-chain,\" he said.","This is important because the company plans to use this funding to increase its validation of profiles, for example by authenticating freelancers\u0027 various training certifications.","Said Tennery:","It\u0027s not Moonlighting\u0027s first foray into crypto. The company considered, but never conducted, an initial coin offering in mid-2018 to help facilitate faster payments. \"Too much scrutiny last year,\" Tennery told CoinDesk. \"Plus EOS VC preferred to invest in traditional equity.\"","Moonlighting co-founders photo (left to right: Roy Slater, Ritesh Johar, Jeff Tennery) courtesy of the company"],"create_date":"2019-04-10T19:00:54Z","tag":"News, freelancing, EOS, Block.one","author":"Brady Dale"}

Building on the foundation set in place by Satoshi Nakamoto, the use cases for this technology have transcended from a �peer-to-peer electronic cash system� to tools for human coordination, memes, institutional-grade financial products, yacht clubs and so much more.","title":"Stellar Smart Contracts Bring DeFi to the �Real World�","content":["In the growing world of Web3 and digital finance, the adoption of cryptocurrency and the use cases for smart contract technology is constantly evolving. Building on the foundation set in place by Satoshi Nakamoto, the use cases for this technology have transcended from a �peer-to-peer electronic cash system� to tools for human coordination, memes, institutional-grade financial products, yacht clubs and so much more.","However complex or seemingly simple these use cases can be, many have been developed as a way to follow one of the most foundational principles in crypto: the democratization of finance. Crypto has long been hailed as a revolutionary force with the potential of banking the unbanked and creating a borderless system of financial services through innovations in areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins.","For crypto to truly create an open, inclusive and equitable financial system for all, we need to create clear pathways for all users to access DeFi and remove the barriers that block access to an otherwise boardless, decentralized financial system. In the Stellar ecosystem, projects and developers have long worked to make this mission a reality.","The Stellar ecosystem is creating an equitable financial system, solving real world issues and connecting the digital world of cryptocurrency to the real world of everyday individuals. With the recent launch of Smart Contracts, Stellar is taking the next step and bringing DeFi into the real world.","Related: Tokenization: Real World Assets, Real World Benefits","Even in a growing period of rapid evolution and adoption, the crypto ecosystem remains an intricate maze of technologies and social systems, often only accessible to those who already possess a high degree of financial literacy and are already connected to systems within traditional finance. Underserved and underrepresented communities are often used to validate crypto innovations, but rarely have the means to access them.","Existing services built on DeFi are not broadly accessible, particularly to the underbanked, unbanked and people living in the developing world. Transaction costs on some chains, such as Ethereum, and CEX fees, are not economically tenable to these users, and the necessary infrastructure to bring fiat into DeFi may not exist at all.","Roughly 2 billion workers around the world fall within the informal cash-based economy, or over 60% of the world�s adult labor force. This majority of the adult labor force lacks access to financial services required to easily use these digital assets, often because cash is their preferred method of value.","Despite this population being a key demographic of the digital asset market, most existing methods of onboarding these users require the very things they don�t have access to. CEXs and other popular onboarding tools require bank cards, accounts and other financial services that are both unnecessary and unused by this population.","The Stellar ecosystem stands as a pioneering force in integrating seamless on- and off-ramps to the network, laying significant groundwork for future developments. With the introduction of Soroban, there is an immediate and effortless connection to the network\u0027s existing high-quality assets, along with its well-established on- and off-ramps. This capability positions Stellar uniquely, enabling low-cost transactions in local currencies within markets that other networks find unreachable.","Consequently, this innovation opens up the doors to DeFi opportunities within underserved markets. The advantage of having accessible on- and off-ramps available from the outset means that developers can direct their focus towards creating applications that address the most pressing needs, without the delay of waiting for the necessary infrastructure to gradually expand. This strategic approach accelerates the path towards realizing impactful use cases, enhancing the financial inclusivity and reach of the Stellar ecosystem.","The Stellar network currently is the second-largest blockchain network in terms of on-ramp locations, and the largest on-ramp provider of USDC, with over 81,000 different locations. For context, Stellar�s USDC on-ramps nearly double that of Ethereum, and increases accessibility through a 99% reduction in transaction fees.","Related: Bigger is Better: Why Stellar Is the Leader in Cash-to-Crypto On and Off-Ramps","While some lower-cost alternatives exist � such as Solana, Near and others � Stellar outperforms the competition in terms of transaction costs while also offering a wide breadth of available distribution of on- and off-ramp channels to service underbanked and unbanked users. Combined with its reputation for reliability and uptime, Stellar is an ecosystem for the next generation of finance that can be seamlessly integrated into both cash economies and traditional financial systems.","Focusing on accessibility and the specific needs of the many is how Stellar and Soroban Smart Contracts have truly moved the needle on democratizing finance. In recognizing that there is a world of user needs to be filled, Soroban represents DeFi for everyone. Users can now access DeFi services and applications via a network of global fiat on- and off-ramps, without a bank account required.","More: The Stellar Network: Use Cases Addressing Global Issues"],"create_date":"2024-04-30T17:29:28.356Z","tag":"","author":"CoinDesk Staff"}

{"url":"https://www.coindesk.com/sponsored-content/new-oms-security-mechanism-from-dappos-revolutionizes-its-intent-based-approach/","web_url":"https://www.coindesk.com/","type":"article","description":"In the spirit of 1995�s sea change in internet functionality, this project�s innovative approach to node staking also improves speed, efficiency and scalability.","title":"New OMS Security Mechanism from DappOS Revolutionizes Its �Intent-Based� Approach","content":["DappOS, an intent-execution network, turns intents into on-chain outcomes by creating a two-sided marketplace. On the supply side, service providers stake collateral and opt into executing tasks that support users� intents. On the demand side, dappOS enables developers to find solutions to fulfill users� intents.","DappOS�s �intent-based� approach is distinct from the less user-friendly �imperative-based� protocols that permeate the crypto space.","To improve efficiency, among other things, dappOS introduced a new security mechanism that offers a superior solution for intent tasks. Optmistic Minimum Staking, or OMS, requires users to accept a predefined, agreed-upon compensation when these tasks fail. The network then allows service providers to execute tasks first and verify the results later. If the task fails, the network reaches a consensus about slashing related service providers to ensure that each task will either be successful or that users will be compensated properly.","Intent execution is a critical narrative for Web3, just like Windows95 was in the early days of the internet. It�s that essential nesting of critical apps to a new infrastructure that can support it all. And it could be the incentive beginners need to educate themselves and get Web3-onboarded.","Before 1995, computers required a command line interface, and users had to memorize commands for file management, network requests and graphic displays. Consequently, the total number of Internet users was limited to around 50,000.","Windows 95 transformed all that. By combining a graphical user interface with an integrated browser, Windows 95 enabled people with no technical background to perform complex operations through clicks and drags, leading to an explosive increase in Internet users � from 50,000 to 100 million in a matter of months.","dappOS believes Web3 is at the same point on the hockey-stick curve today. Technological breakthroughs in crypto have led to such novel forms of assets and protocols as Ordinal and Runes. Still, a large number of users have no access to them due to barriers between Web2 and Web3. This, according to dappOS, is the most urgent problem to be solved in order to attract more investors and users.","Web3 users, just like those pioneers in the early �90s, need to master the commands for every intermediate step. But dappOS�s intent execution network now enables them to confirm their intents by clicking with a mouse. They get to obtain the expected results, even with no understanding of the technical details.","Because of dappOS�s OMS mechanism, service providers can provide whatever value-specific service that can be verified and only need to stake minimal collateral. Since the rigorous verifying process happens after the task execution, users benefit from the increased speed to completion.","Almost as an afterthought, OMS contributes to operational efficiency and economic scalability. By allowing tasks to be executed before being verified and requiring minimal collateral, OMS can speed up the overall process and reduce the capital burden on service providers. This makes the market more efficient as resources are utilized more effectively.","Even so, OMS�s primary function is to improve security. This mechanism reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior, since failing to execute tasks as intended results in a financial penalty for the service providers. The fundamental principle is that aligning financial incentives with performance outcomes naturally boosts compliance and reliability.","OMS is a new and innovative approach. It is in fact a dappOS innovation and, to the best of the project team�s knowledge, nobody else is using it yet.","This first-mover advantage is not the only market factor in dappOS�s favor. Even after others catch up, OMS will long provide the competitive advantage inherent in its flexibility and the reduced economic burden it places on participants. DappOS will always be able to say it has provided this potential to offer faster and cheaper operations longer than other networks that now operate under more rigid security mechanisms.","When zooming in on the advancement that is OMS, though, it is important to not overlook the broader context. OMS is an improvement on a working model, and that model � intent-centricity � is the major breakthrough.","Seamless integration with any dapp on any chain, improved performance and heightened security are all among the benefits provided by intent-centricity, and they are only enhanced by the OMS mechanism.","There are also strategic growth opportunities for public chains to consider as dappOS-enabled dapps and chains attract new users and higher TVL.","Powered by OMS mechanism, dappOS already has several intent task frameworks for developers to integrate, such as unified account, intent assets and real-time dapp interaction.","dappOS\u0027s unified account natively supports its intent-execution network, allowing users to smoothly manage and use their assets across different networks. Such technical details as chain-specific issues or gas payments are invisible to users, who can transfer, trade and leverage their assets within any dappOS-supported dapp.","Again, unified accounts bolster dappOS�s original concept of �intent assets,� which are Web3 versions of savings accounts. DappOS�s intent-execution network harmonizes these with a diverse array of blockchain environments. For an example, let�s say dappOS creates an intent asset that functions like a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. This asset can be used as either USDT or USDC depending on the case, and it automatically generates yields when deposited in the account. This makes it easier for new users to explore the Web3 ecosystem without having to understand the nuances between two stablecoins that purport to have equal value.","DappOS intent-execution network provides an excellent framework for real-time dapp interactions.","One more dappOS use case relates to real-time dapp interaction. Using this network, users can transition seamlessly from the initial state to the final state with a simple signature. Instead of injecting manual processes into such multiple on-chain operations as cross-chain transfers, asset swapping and authorization, dappOS\u0027s real-time interaction framework removes these unnecessary intermediary operations, fulfilling users� intents with a single signature.","Because advances in modularity have significantly lowered the barrier of launching blockchains lately, thousands or even millions of L1 or L2 solutions will soon emerge in this space. Each one would be a mini-ecosystem, making Web3 even more fragmented and difficult to navigate than it is already.","Meantime, such circle-breaking dapps as Socialfi and Gamefi have opened up a range of new users from the traditional Wev2 world who are eager to streamline their workflow as completely new navigators.","Taken together, these two trends drive the adoption of intent-centric solutions for blockchain and dapp developers for its capability to unify the fragmented ecosystem and prioritize new users. Intent execution networking is becoming the ideal infrastructure to fulfill these intents for billions of onboarding users and hasten mass adoption for intent-centric chains and dapps."],"create_date":"2024-05-03T15:27:56.138Z","tag":"","author":"CoinDesk Staff"}

The Experimental Standard Whose First Token Has Rocketed 12,000% in One Week","content":["The first token based on a new, unofficial, and experimental type of Ethereum standard has given rise to a new multi-million sub-asset class in the crypto market.","Pandora (PANDORA), the first of the so-called �ERC-404� tokens, traded as high as $32,000 on Friday morning from a low of $250 in just under a week. It has a supply of only 8,000 tokens and traded some $76 million in volumes in the past 24 hours.","Several projects have already latched on to the hype and issued their own versions of ERC-404 tokens.","Some of these have airdropped a small part of their token supply to Pandora holders, boosting demand for the token while also creating hype for their own projects. While, some have launched on other blockchains, such as Arbitrum and Solana, in a bid to be the first mover in an entirely different ecosystem.","Prominent exchanges OKX and Binance have announced support for ERC-404 tokens on their Web3 wallets, adding legitimacy to the standard and further boosting hype.","ERC-404 combines the popular ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards � for token issuance on Ethereum and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), respectively � into one that lets developers create fractionalized NFT collections that can be freely traded and used in the open market.","In their current form, NFTs exist as a one-for-one asset, unlike tokens, where holders can buy a fraction of a whole.","While fractionalized NFTs do exist, they typically depend on an entity that locks up those NFTs in a wallet and issues tokens that represent that NFT. Those fractionalized tokens are freely traded and may not accurately match the locked NFT�s value.","That�s one of the key problems ERC-404 sets out to solve. It allows multiple wallets to directly own a single NFT, and, in the future, create a use case where that specific exposure can be tokenized and used to take out loans or stake holdings.","�People in crypto hate friction,� ctrl, one of the developers of Pandora and ERC-404, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.","�Every solution before ERC-404 had too much friction and was usually a wrapping solution that abstracted the original NFT that people wanted to fractionalize or make liquid,� he said. �Collectors hated this, and it limited adoption significantly.

Every one of the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization is assigned to an industry, defined by DACS, then at least one industry is assigned to an industry group, and finally, at least one industry group is assigned to a sector.","Currently, there are six sectors defined by DACS including Currency, Computing, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), Digitization, Culture & Entertainment, and Smart Contract Platform. The Computing sector is the fifth-largest sector in DACS with 68 assets representing 1.7% of the digital asset market worth approximately $29.9 billion in market capitalization as of April 30,2022.","","Exhibit 1: CoinDesk Indices DACS","","Defining the Computing sector","The CoinDesk DACS Computing sector contains protocols that aim to build and support the infrastructure of Web3 and distributed computing. The decentralization of Web2 services like cloud computing, storage, networking and databases has the ability to increase security and privacy measures by removing the centralized points of failure that exist in Web2 providers. In addition, these systems return ownership of data and information to the network participants in a way that users can earn revenue by contributing to their operation.","The DACS Glossary defines the Computing sector as follows:","The Computing sector consists of projects that aim to decentralize the sharing, storing, and transmission of data by removing intermediaries and ensuring privacy for all users. All projects that aim to gather, transmit, store and share data and web services in a decentralized manner play a key role in building the infrastructure of Web3. This includes on-chain and off-chain data transmission, social data platforms, peer-to-peer secure data transactions, open networks, free market private computation, and decentralized file storage and file sharing.","Industry groups inside the Computing sector","The industry groups in the Computing sector depend on the services the protocol offers. Each project serves a different function in decentralized computing and has varying tokenomics and incentive structures. The industries in the Computing sector include Shared Storage, Oracle, IoT, Private Computing and Shared Network. The CoinDesk DACS Glossary definitions for each of the above industries is as follows:","Shared Storage refers to the decentralization of storage servers that are traditionally owned and operated by a central organization. Shared storage protocols such as Filecoin (FIL) 1 decentralizes the storage responsibilities across an open-source network of miners with a system of economic incentives. This allows for pseudonymous, private file sharing on a decentralized network. The centralization of cloud data storage offers high risks that expose the cloud network to potential hacks. Malicious actors have the potential to access sensitive information of millions of users, through a singular data breach due to the inherent centralization. Shared storage platforms increase security of data storage by running on a blockchain network that allows for privacy and pseudonymity of data transmitters.","Oracle refers to any project with the primary ability to gather, organize and transmit either on-chain to on-chain data or off-chain to on-chain data in real time. Blockchain oracles typically operate with a native token to cover transaction costs and governance rights. Oracles can enable real time off-chain data to be used in decentralized applications. The largest asset in the Computing sector, Chainlink (LINK) 2, is widely used by many DeFi applications as a source of off-chain market data.","IoT includes protocols that contribute to the development of the Internet of Things and Web3 that combine blockchain with real world, off-chain connections. IoT platforms such as Helium (HNT) 3 allow for application interoperability between IoT networks and blockchains. They allow interconnectivity on a trustless network with no reliance on any central entity or centralized database of user info that can be subject to manipulation. IoT can allow the execution of smart contracts using oracles and real-world data.","Private Computing refers to the free market buying and selling of cloud computing power, surplus bandwidth, security as a service, and other computational services for one-off instances on demand. Private computing markets are decentralized, global, and pseudonymous with no barriers to entry. In Private Computing, providers can list their own individual computation or security capabilities which users can purchase based on the listed market prices set by the provider.","Shared Network refers to an open network of distributed cloud computing that allows participants (miners) to offer energy and computation resources at a variable cost to pseudonymous buyers. A Shared Network also includes open networks that provide miners with a low cost, decentralized alternative to the existing web service providers. The decentralized upholding of the network and its growth aligns with Metcalfe�s law of networks and relinquishes the need for large, centralized cloud service providers.","Within the Computing sector, Shared Storage Oracle and IoT are the three largest industry groups, representing 30.1%, 27.4%, and 27.2% of the sector market cap, respectively. Private Computing and Shared Network are smaller, representing 7.9% and 7.6% of the sector market cap, respectively.","","Exhibit 2: Computing Sector Breakdown by Industry Group","","Exhibit 3: Industry Groups Under Computing Sector","(CoinDesk Indices, May 13, 2022. Market capitalization data is based on 4/30/2022.)","Industries inside the Computing sector","Within the Computing sector, each industry group currently consists of a single industry to which a digital asset is assigned. Therefore, the industry composition of the sector is the same as the industry group composition. However, as the sector grows, it is possible for additional industries to emerge.","Major assets inside the Computing sector","There are 68 digital assets inside the Computing sector, with top assets Chainlink (LINK) 2, representing 17.2% of the Computing Sector, and the top 10 assets representing 63.4% of the total market cap. There are 19 assets in the Shared Storage Industry Group, totaling around $9 billion in market cap, with Filecoin (FIL) 1 being the largest. In the Oracle industry group, there are 11 assets totaling around $8 billion in market cap, with Chainlink (LINK) 2 being the largest. There are currently 11 assets in the IoT industry group, totaling $8 billion in market cap, with Internet Computer (ICP) being the largest. There are 12 assets in Private Computing Industry Group with $2 billion market cap and Threshold (T) as its largest token. Finally, there are 15 assets in the Shared Network Industry group, with $2 billion market cap and Ankr (ANKR) as its largest token.","Exhibit 4: Top 10 Assets Inside the DACS Computing Sector","(CoinDesk Indices, May 13, 2022. Market capitalization data is based on 4/30/2022.)","Conclusion","The Computing Sector includes assets that serve as platforms to decentralize the traditional web services; web services that have been prominent throughout Web 2.0. While many assets in this sector are still in the early adoption stage, their technology has strong foundations with decentralization as a key principle. By creating web services that are decentralized, more users can partake in and benefit from the application whilst giving providers economic incentives to sustain network growth. Decentralized distributed computing, storage and other services hold the potential to disrupt today�s web service providers and address the security issues associated with centralized databases as a central point of attack for malicious actors.","Read more: How to Add Value to Real-World Documents With Authentication","References","1. Filecoin (FIL): Filecoin is a distributed file storage protocols built on Ethereum. It enables secure and private transaction of encrypted files on an immutable and censorship resistant blockchain. Transaction costs are paid to both Ethereum miners and the Filecoin miners. This creates an ecosystem in which miners can benefit from supporting the network and running the protocol, and users can benefit from the increased security and privacy achieved by distributed computing.","2. Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized, open-source oracle service built on Ethereum. Chainlink oracles have the ability to connect both on-chain to on-chain data as well as on-chain to off-chain data. It allows smart contracts to access off-chain data feeds securely.","3. Helium (HNT): Helium is a blockchain based network for IoT devices. It allows low-powered wireless devices to communicate with each other and send data across the network nodes operated by users who mine and earn rewards in Helium�s native token HNT.

Notable joiners on today�s round are Omidyar Technology Ventures, the original online marketplace builders.","","","San Francisco-based Braintrust is another example of how the core tenets of DeFi�s multi-billion dollar science experiment can be applied to real-world use cases. Unlike the often vague �utility� of ICO tokens that were sold in the billions back in 2017, Braintrust is focused on solving the liquidity problem encountered when establishing two-sided marketplaces.","","","Braintrust�s solution reflects the pooled flexibility and decentralized governance of protocols like Compound Finance, on which some of its software is based.","","","Read more: This Startup Is Forking Compound to Make Hiring More Efficient","","","Stepping back, Braintrust CEO Adam Jackson is a veteran at building two-sided marketplaces, including an e-commerce platform acquired by Intuit, an automotive marketplace acquired by Advanced Autoparts and another called Doctor on Demand. The common denominator is how expensive it can be to build liquidity into these networks in order to make them fly, and the effect this can have further down the line.","","","�The typical playbook from eBay all the way up to the gig economy players we see now, is you raise hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars, and use that money to subsidize one or both sides of the marketplace,� said Jackson. �You�re essentially paying people to show up.�","","","And the way this typically plays out is the investors, who are the owners of the marketplace, sooner or later start taxing the network, turning up the fees. This then starts to erode the network effects of the business, said Jackson, creating divergent incentives between the operators of the service and the people who make a living there.","","","The depressing nadir of this is encapsulated in the iniquities of Uber; the sort of stuff that has effectively lowered the minimum wage in the U.S., said Jackson.","","","�While five guys in San Francisco became deca-billionaires, a third of all Uber drivers live below the poverty line, some of them even live in the cars they drive,� he said. �So I wanted to figure out how we could create a marketplace that is owned and controlled by its users, instead of investors who just want to tax it.�","","","Jackson describes Braintrust as a �labor protocol� in the same way that Ethereum is a smart -contract protocol. As such, it�s more like a non-profit, a kind of public good, he said, upon which other businesses and use cases will flourish, rather like the composability, or the Lego-like functionality of building with DeFi.","","","�Our business model with Braintrust involves lowering the fees to almost zero. We charge talent zero; we charge clients 10%, that�s just meant to kind of pay our bills and sustain us,� Jackson said. �By lowering fees to zero, you enable a whole new class of big transactions that could never touch a place like Upwork, because the fees are too high.�","","","Likewise, the project�s tokenomics are confined to governance and voting decisions (there will be a free issuance of tokens to Braintrust users in the middle of next year). The tokens are simply a way to get millions of users across the world on the same page because you can�t have someone in Ukraine or in India custody a share of a Delaware C-corp, said Jackson.","","","�A blockchain-secure token is a perfect value-capture incentive and governance instrument to replace a share of stock,� Jackson said. �And when I say replace, I don�t mean a financial token, there�s no dividend.�","","","Once the Braintrust community of freelancers is up and running, they will be able to use their tokens to vote on proposals such as fee levels, categories of work to be added, standards for allowing workers to join and so on.","","","Braintrust�s token voting system is a fork of the governance framework created by DeFi money market Compound Finance, actually using some of the same code. (Compound CEO Robert Leshner is a close ally and advisor to the project.)","","","Jackson pointed out that he started Braintrust well before DeFi was a thing, but said the comparison is apt.","","","�What DeFi figured out was how to use a token as an incentive mechanism to bootstrap liquidity in a two-sided marketplace � DeFi�s lend and borrow,� he said. �We�re doing the same thing, using a token to bootstrap liquidity in a two-sided marketplace. Ours is labor and clients.�","","","Following a two-year incubation and armed with a $6 million seed round, Braintrust�s private beta was just getting off the ground when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.","","","�We thought we were toast,� said Jackson.","","","But after �a terrible few months,� clients started calling back, with more and more large firms accepting that working remotely was becoming the norm. �So that has become a big tailwind,� Jackson said. �Our Q3 was two times our pre-COVID financial plan for marketplace transactions and that has brought us to this fundraising round we are announcing.�","","","In terms of numbers, Jackson said Braintrust currently has several thousand testnet token holders and a waitlist of 40,000 for when the service goes public next year. There�s also an impressive roster of 50 or so Fortune 100 clients.","","","�We just won a job at NASA, where we have a group of engineers building software that will track packages to and from the International Space Station,� said Jackson. �We�re building car software for Porsche, insurance shopping software for Blue Cross Blue Shield. So these are big jobs. It�s not like a logo on a website.�","","","The thing that�s attracting big enterprise players like Porsche and Nestle are the low fees, Jackson reiterated, and not some kind of tech wizardry.","","","�It�s not because we are building on a blockchain,� he said. �These guys don�t give a shit about that.�",""],"create_date":"2020-10-01T16:00:23Z","tag":"Uber, Porsche, Nestle, NASA, DeFi, Compound, Braintrust","author":"Ian Allison"}

It underscores the role that sound, professional journalism can play in bringing transparency to the too-often-opaque and, sadly, scam-ridden crypto industry.","As Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker and Executive Editor Marc Hochstein put it in their write-up of the three award-winning stories (Ian�s initial scoop on Alameda�s balance sheet, his followup on Binance being likely to withdraw its bailout and Tracy�s bombshell on CEO Sam Bankman-Fried�s �cabal of roommates� that ran FTX): �There is little precedent in journalism history for a story that made such an impact and did it so quickly.�","It�s painful to see so many FTX victims in the fallout from what Ian and Tracy uncovered. But the reality is it would have eventually been exposed. That it wasn�t earlier is, in fact, the problem. It�s why a professional, independent media is vital for an industry with trust issues.","But it takes a technical grounding to cover this complex topic properly. Just as bankers exploited miscomprehension of collateralized debt obligations pre-2008, crypto scammers hide behind techno-fog. That can be challenging for reporters unfamiliar with the tech. It�s why some mainstream coverage of Bankman-Fried left a lot to be desired.","Here, CoinDesk is unique. Sure, there are quality crypto reporters in mainstream media as well as in the crypto press, but no outlet has nearly as deep a bench as we do. We combine the best of mainstream and crypto journalism.","We are led by Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds in editorial, who had a storied 23-year career at Bloomberg, and by Joanne Po, executive producer and head of multimedia, who led TV and digital multimedia teams at CNBC, The Wall Street Journal and Fox Digital. We have other senior editors with decades of newsroom experience. Just as importantly, we employ many scoop-hungry, crypto-native reporters � some of them straight out of school, others older � with deep, personal understanding of the technology and its opportunities and challenges.","This two-way approach is more important than ever. Contrary to its critics, crypto isn�t going anywhere. But, clearly, it needs to be improved, both on the technical side and in the regulatory framework. If it is to live up to its transformative potential, it�s vital that crypto�s problems be exposed, so that solutions can be iteratively developed and so that promising projects are given the attention they deserve.","It has become popular in some crypto circles to argue that this should be left to solo �citizen journalists� on Twitter. But while there�s definitely a place for the crowdsourcing of information that happens on social media, Ian and Tracy�s work is Exhibit A in the case for why independent, structured press organizations like CoinDesk remain vital.","Until someone comes up with something better � perhaps, one day, a workable, trusted decentralized system for uncovering facts and holding bad actors accountable � there�s no substitute for the training or the embedded principles of professional journalism with which reporters develop trust with sources, report accurately and work with integrity.","Do we occasionally get things wrong? Sure. But there�s a commitment, day in and day out, to endeavor to get it right, promptly correct and disclose our mistakes and strive for objectivity and transparency. The best way to address the conspiracy theorists who blindly claim we serve some puppet master�s interests is to point to the proof in our pudding.","Today is therefore not only a day to celebrate Ian and Tracy and their editor, Nick Baker, but every single person at CoinDesk. They have all contributed to a workplace that allows and encourages our journalists to pursue these high standards � one result of which is this highly deserved accolade. It�s a day, also, to recognize why it�s so important that the wider crypto industry supports media institutions like CoinDesk that live by these principles."],"create_date":"2023-02-20T15:15:43.271Z","tag":"CoinDesk, Journalism, Opinion","author":"Michael J.

But while this volatility makes them a concern for regulators, it also presents an opportunity for investors to generate significant profits, particularly when compared to traditional asset classes like stocks and commodities. Over 2020, amid the coronavirus outbreak, bitcoin ended the year up 160% versus the S&P 500 at 14% and gold up 22%.","","","Adding to this volatility is the potential to increase the size of crypto trading positions through the use of derivatives products like margin trading, perpetual swaps and futures. Derivatives are contracts based on the price of an underlying asset and allow people to bet on the asset\u0027s future price. Crypto derivatives first appeared in 2011 and have gathered huge momentum in more recent years, especially among gung-ho retail investors looking to get the most out of their trading strategies.","","","With margin trading, traders can increase their earning potential by using borrowed funds from a cryptocurrency exchange. Binance, Huobi and Bitmex are some of the leading examples of centralized crypto exchanges that allow customers to trade on margin.","","","But there�s something very important to note here. While borrowing funds to increase your trade positions can amplify any potential gains, you can also lose your invested capital just as easily, making this type of trading a two-edged sword.","","","Margin trading involves increasing the amount of money you have to trade with by borrowing third-party funds. Think of it as borrowing money from a stranger to buy bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. But in this case, you are borrowing from a crypto exchange. This allows investors to increase the size of their trading positions, also known as �leverage.�","","","Naturally, a stranger would not lend you money to trade for free. Similarly, in margin trading, the exchange will require you to put up an amount of crypto or fiat as collateral � known as an �initial margin� � in order to open a trading position. This initial margin is like an insurance fund for the exchange in case the trade goes against the borrower.","","","It is also worth mentioning that the amount of money you can borrow from an exchange relative to your initial margin is determined by the leverage. For example, if you use a 5x leverage on an initial margin of $100, you will be taking a $400 loan to increase your trading position from $100 to $500.","","","Each trade has the potential to make or lose more money depending on the size of the leverage. For instance, using the 5x leverage example above, if the price of an asset rises by 10%, you will make a profit of $50 on your $500 trading position, which represents a 50% profit relative to your initial $100 margin. You could then repay the $400 loan you took out and keep $150 for yourself ($50 profit + $100 initial margin.)","","","However, if the value of the cryptocurrency you�re trading drops by 10%, you would have lost $50 from your initial margin (50% loss.)","","","There is a simple formula to calculate your potential profits/losses when using leverage.","","=fit or Loss \u003d (Initial Margin) x (% price movement) x (leverage)","","","For clarity, use �plus� to represent positive price movements and �minus� for negative price movements. In general, remember that leverage is how much your initial margin can gain OR lose. Ensure you keep your potential losses to manageable levels.","","","In the context of cryptocurrency markets, liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader�s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader�s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.) Liquidation occurs in both margin and futures trading.","","","Trading with a leveraged position is a high-risk strategy, and it is possible to lose your entire collateral (initial margin) if the market makes a large enough move against your leveraged position. In fact, some countries like the United Kingdom consider it so risky it has banned crypto exchanges from offering retail investors leveraged trading products to protect novice traders from being liquidated and losing all their invested capital.","","","You can keep track of the percentage the market needs to move against your position it to be liquidated by using this f=:","","","Liquidation % \u003d 100 / Leverage","","","For instance, if you use 5x leverage, your position will be liquidated if the price of an asset moves 20%=st your position (100/5 \u003d 20.)","","","When using leverage, there are a handful of options available to mitigate the chances of being liquidated. One of these options is known as a �stop loss.�","","","A stop-loss, otherwise known as a �stop order� or �stop-market order� is an advanced order that an investor places on a crypto exchange, instructing the exchange to sell an asset when it reaches a particular price point.","","","When setting up a stop loss, you will need to input:","","","If the market price reaches your stop price, the stop order automatically executes and sells the asset at whichever price and amount stated. If the trader feels the market could move quickly against them, they might choose to set the sell price lower than the stop price so it�s more likely to get filled (bought by another trader.)","","","The primary purpose of a stop loss is to limit potential losses. To put things in perspective, let�s consider two scenarios.","","","Scenario 1: A trader has $5,000 in his account but decides to use an initial margin of $100 and leverage of 10x to create a position of $1,000. He places a stop loss at 2.5% from his entry position. In this instance, the trader could potentially lose $25 in this trade, which is a mere 0.5% of his entire account size.","","","If the trader does not use a stop loss, his position will be liquidated if there is a 10% drop in the price of the asset. Remember the liquidation formula above.","","","Scenario 2: Another trader has $5,000 in his trading account but uses an initial margin of $2,500 and a 3x leverage to create a position of $7,500. By placing a stop loss at 2.5% away from his entry position, the trader could lose $187.5 in this trade, a 3.75% loss from their account.","","","The lesson here is that while using higher leverage is typically considered very risky, this factor becomes very important if your position size is too large, as seen in the second scenario. As a rule of thumb, try to keep your losses per trade at less than 1.5% of your entire account size.","","","When it comes to margin trading, risk management is arguably the most important lesson. Your primary goal should be to keep losses at a minimum level even before thinking about profits. No trading model is infallible. Therefore, you must deploy mechanisms to help you survive when the market doesn�t go as expected.","","","Placing stop losses correctly is vitally important, and while there is no golden rule for setting a stop loss, a spread of 2%-5% of your trade size is often recommended. Alternatively, some traders prefer to set stop losses just below the most recent swing low (provided it�s not so low you�d stand to be liquidated before it triggered).","","","Secondly, you should manage your trading size and the associated risk. The higher your leverage, the higher your chances of being liquidated. Using excessive leverage is akin to exposing your capital to unnecessary risk. Moreover, some exchanges manage liquidations aggressively. BitMEX, for example, only allows traders to hold BTC as initial margin. This means if bitcoin�s price falls, so too does the amount of funds held in collateral resulting in faster liquidations.","","","Due to the risk associated with leverage trading, some exchanges have moved to lower the limit traders can access. Both Binance and FTX are among the leading centralized crypto exchanges to slash leverage limits from 100x to 20x.",""],"create_date":"2021-08-13T21:06:01Z","tag":"Crypto Trading, Learn, Evergreen, Explainer","author":"Andrey Sergeenkov"}

While some markets like the United States had taken a passive approach through regulation by enforcement, almost nobody wanted to take action and create a workable framework to separate the good actors from the bad in the crypto industry.","Though this status quo approach was maintained for the majority of crypto�s existence, eventually the industry became too big to ignore. Industry participants and consumers have grown tired of �black swan� and �once in a lifetime� events. Bad actors have repeatedly set the crypto industry back and continued to diminish the reputation of what should be the future of finance.","For the crypto industry to move forward, it�s time to stop asking, �Why regulation?� and start asking �When regulation?� To have a truly fresh start, global regulators and the industry need to work together to create a workable framework that fosters innovation, supports the good actors and filters out the bad.","If you�ve ever tried to convince your friends or family to get into cryptocurrency, then you definitely already know all the reasons they believe it\u0027s a scam. You can tirelessly try to explain to them that crypto isn�t for criminal activity or money laundering, or that the crypto providers and services you use are regulated, but these rebuttals often fall on deaf ears.","To their credit, those statements aren�t exactly incorrect; crypto has been used in criminal activity and money laundering and moved by unregulated services. Even if all of these activities combined made up only 1% of the crypto industry, that one percent is going to leave the wrong impression on those who may be unwilling to enter the industry.","Until we can ensure that the industry properly deals with bad actors, these arguments will always be used against adoption. For every 1,000 industry participants acting correctly, there�s going to be one company like FTX that will damage the reputation and validity of crypto. It�s not your responsibility to make sure that the one bad actor doesn�t exist � that�s the responsibility of regulation.","We need regulations set in place for this industry to succeed because people need to know their crypto providers and be assured that they are acting legitimately. Until recently, many crypto exchanges operated in an unregulated manner and many international exchanges still operate similarly today.","Just recently in the United States, Binance CEO CZ pled guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) for failing to maintain proper AML programs and now faces up to three years in prison. At the same time, exchanges like zondacrypto have long held compliance as a top priority, and possess regulatory licenses in Canada and several European markets.","Without proper regulation, users will not know where to find a trusted crypto service provider and the industry will continue to suffer as the result of a few bad actors. While zondacrypto has put clients first and embraced regulations for over ten years, the crypto industry needs clear policies globally in order to create a clear and safe path toward adoption.","When on the subject of regulation, the EU�s recent enactment of Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is almost always the first topic of discussion. For those opposed to crypto regulation, this was one of the largest blows to the industry. But for everyone else, MiCA demonstrated that providing regulatory clarity to the crypto industry is possible, and serves as a blueprint for future legislation around the world.","Cryptocurrency knows no borders, and the EU-wide legislation supports this notion with a framework for consistent enforcement and regulatory compliance for anyone looking to do business in Europe. A cohesive and tailored framework is essential for fostering innovation and ensuring fair competition in the crypto industry, while simultaneously maintaining robust consumer protection and upholding market integrity.","Rather than push back at regulations and jeopardize the safety of client funds, zondacrypto has wholly embraced MiCA as an opportunity to operate and better safeguard the industry. Maintaining regulatory compliance isn\u0027t new to zondacrypto; in fact, the company was already licensed in key European markets, including Estonia, Switzerland, Lithuania, Italy, Slovakia and Poland. While the crypto industry tried to run fast and break things, zondacrypto made a the decision to self-regulate and regularly met with regulators in Europe to prepare for upcoming regulation.","While MiCA�s innovation supporting measures don�t take action until 2025, zondacrypto is already ready for compliance, with its existing license in Estonia providing protections exceeding that of MiCA itself. When Estonian license requirements saw the number of licensed entities drop by 90%, zondacrypto embraced regulation and continued to operate. Now, without having to move quickly and adjust to new regulations, zondacrypto can continue to focus on innovation and building new products like the ZND platform and app.","With crypto receiving a fresh start in Europe, MiCA also presents consumers and industry participants with the opportunity to do the same and start asking whether your crypto-asset service provider is ready or risking being kicked off the market.","The crypto industry is ready for a fresh start and more regulation. While zondacrypto is committed to providing effective and compliant crypto services, we cannot rely on others to do the same. To foster both adoption and innovation, we need to stop questioning and start embracing international regulation."],"create_date":"2024-04-30T21:43:16.301Z","tag":"","author":"CoinDesk Staff"}

This is the news organization�s first major journalism award.","CoinDesk�s Ian Allison and Tracy Wang won the prize for financial reporting, according to a statement Monday. Previous winners in that category include The Wall Street Journal�s series on Theranos and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists� stories on the so-called Panama Papers.","Created in 1949 by Long Island University to honor murdered war correspondent George Polk, the Polk Awards are among the most prestigious prizes in journalism and emphasize �investigative work that is original, resourceful and thought-provoking.� The trio of honored CoinDesk stories exemplified those qualities.","�This is an important milestone, not only for CoinDesk, but for crypto media generally,� said Michael Casey, CoinDesk�s chief content officer. �Despite all that Ian and Tracy�s incredible reporting exposed � and the fallout that it triggered � the crypto industry will continue to have a significant impact on the world. It�s vital that it be covered with the kind of probing, well-informed, professional journalism embodied by these two reporters and their attentive, dedicated editors.�","The industry-shaking Nov. 2 story from Allison, a senior reporter, resulted from a source�s tip that Sam Bankman-Fried�s closely held trading firm, Alameda Research, was on shakier financial footing than was generally known. Allison got to work finding evidence and nailed it by obtaining the company�s balance sheet, which was not a public document.","It showed that a significant portion of Alameda�s billions of dollars in assets was secretly made up of FTT, a sort of digital Monopoly money issued by Bankman-Fried�s better-known FTX crypto exchange.","The resulting story raised concerns about the stability of Alameda and FTX, and called into question Bankman-Fried�s image as a white knight capable of backstopping struggling companies and as an �adult in the room� in a field notorious for fly-by-night outfits and scammers. The article debuted in a world where FTX was fast becoming a household name thanks to a marketing blitz featuring Larry David, Tom Brady and Gisele B�ndchen.","Within days the price of FTT plummeted and Bankman-Fried agreed to a bailout from rival exchange Binance. Almost immediately, Binance got cold feet, as revealed by another Polk-winning scoop from Allison that instantly drove down prices in the entire crypto market. Hours later, Binance confirmed it was backing out of the deal.","Wang, a deputy managing editor, provided the third CoinDesk scoop honored by the Polk Awards: A story revealing that Bankman-Fried and nine co-workers lived together in a luxury Bahamas condominium and at times dated each other while running his companies � including the fact that Bankman-Fried and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison had once been a couple. The piece raised concerns about nepotism, secrecy and conflicts of interest, previewing the tone of a scathing report issued soon after on FTX�s extremely lax administrative procedures.","Nine days after Allison�s initial story, Bankman-Fried�s companies filed for bankruptcy protection. Not long after, Bankman-Fried was arrested and the U.S. Congress held hearings.","There is little precedent in journalism history for a story that made such an impact and did it so quickly. The fallout reverberated throughout the crypto industry and even hurt CoinDesk�s corporate sibling Genesis and parent company Digital Currency Group, underscoring CoinDesk�s editorial independence and dedication to telling important stories.","More than 2,000 news stories have credited CoinDesk for setting off the chain of events, including pieces from high-profile publications like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The Financial Times, The Verge, New York Magazine, CNN and NPR�s �Planet Money� podcast.","�As great an honor as the George Polk award is, I gotta say Ian and Tracy totally deserve it for some of the best journalism it�s been my pleasure to witness,� said Kevin Reynolds, CoinDesk�s editor-in-chief. �They and the work they did are totally awesome. I also need to give a shout-out to Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, who was a key partner to Ian and Tracy in bringing these market-shaking stories to life, and to the rest of the CoinDesk news team, which kicked butt on covering the maelstrom that resulted from Ian and Tracy�s incredible scoops.�","Read More: CoinDesk�s Major Award Is a Huge Moment for Us and Crypto Media Generally"],"create_date":"2023-02-20T15:00:00Z","tag":"FTX, Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried, CoinDesk, Journalism","author":"Nick Baker and Marc Hochstein"}

This could be a novel technology, an unmet market need, or a disruptive approach to solving an existing problem. Next, they have to convince others of what they believe is possible. Instead of limiting their talent search to traditional channels, successful entrepreneurs actively seek out individuals from unconventional backgrounds or industries who possess the skills and creativity needed to drive their ventures forward. For example, I�ve hired former special forces officers who have repeatedly proven to be among the most valuable contributors to my teams. By casting a wider net, and embracing divergence in their teams, entrepreneurs can access fresh ideas and perspectives that fuel innovation and differentiation.","What role do you believe blockchain technology will play in shaping the future of financial services?","Blockchain technology has the potential to democratize access to financial services, making it more inclusive and efficient. By facilitating faster, cheaper, more transparent, and inherently less risky transactions, Oasis Pro has rapidly become the trusted middleware layer and solutions provider powering legacy financial institutions and fund managers into blockchain. We enable global banks and asset managers to swiftly leverage these solutions without the need for a substantial resource allocation. One of our strategic partner�s average implementation period is 12-18 months, whereas we completed our implementation with them in just two-and-a-half months.","How does your work in the blockchain and digital asset space differ from your time in traditional financial services?","What has been most striking is the collective effort among creators, builders, and developers to shape the evolving landscape of blockchain and digital assets. Despite fierce competition, there\u0027s a notable culture of mutual support and collaboration among operators. There is a very real shared goal of pioneering innovative infrastructure and reshaping established systems. Partnerships and collaborations hold significant value, driving collective progress and fostering a sense of community among industry players in the space.","How did partnerships shape your success at Figure Technologies and Provenance Blockchain?","We were incredibly tactical in using partnerships to lay the foundation for widespread adoption of our fintech solutions. Forging alliances with leading financial institutions like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Jefferies empowered us to revolutionize the lending industry through innovative blockchain solutions. We also collaborated closely with regulatory bodies like the OCC to ensure compliance and credibility - key during the early stages of new technology innovation. The power of these kinds of strategic partnerships is evident in last year�s Project Guardian proof of concept, with the participation of Oasis Pro, Provenance Blockchain, J.P.

Here\u0027s a look at the sector, its significance as a digital asset sector and how CoinDesk Indices is setting standards that define this sector.","title":"What Is So Smart About Smart Contract Platforms?","content":["Ether (ETH) is the main token of the Ethereum blockchain and is now the world�s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Just like the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), ether can be used to send payments directly to another person without the need for an intermediary.","The long-term vision for Ethereum is to power more than just financial transactions. Software developers can build applications on Ethereum, ranging from decentralized platforms for lending money to social media networks to develop and exchange content. ETH is unique in its ability to fill the role of a capital asset, consumable/transformable asset, and as a store of value.","The innovative qualities of Ethereum have led to an explosion of new digital assets in the Smart Contract Platform (SCP) sector. This blog post takes a brief look at the Smart Contract Platform sector, its significance as a digital asset sector and how CoinDesk Indices is setting standards that define this sector.","Smart contracts are computerized blockchain protocols that execute terms of a contract. Smart contracts represent computer codes ensuring that when both parties meet the terms of the contract they will execute automatically, allowing for trustless, peer-to-peer transactions. SCP assets are designed for the building of decentralized applications, layer 2 scaling systems, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and other custom protocols.","Every platform has a unique open-source user and miner incentive structure that utilizes the Byzantine Fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism. Every platform also utilizes a native token for the payment towards building on the platform, providing liquidity and allowing interoperability between the native token and the newly created tokens built on the platform.","In December 2021, CoinDesk Indices launched its Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) to set the standard for defining the industries of digital assets. Every one of the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization is assigned to an industry defined by DACS. Then, at least one industry is assigned to an industry group. Finally, at least one industry group is assigned to a sector.","The SCP sector is the second-largest sector in DACS, with 88 assets representing over 35% of the digital asset market worth approximately $750 billion in market capitalization as of March 31, 2022. In addition to the SCP sector, DACS offers five other sectors: Currency, Computing, Culture & Entertainment, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and Digitization. The six sectors in DACS represent 22 industry groups and 35 industries.","To be assigned to an industry in the SCP sector, the digital asset must be transparent, self-executing and trustless. Smart contract platforms tend to have their own blockchains and consensus mechanisms, but it is disputable how to classify tokens with smart contract capabilities, depending on whether they are used for specific applications or not intended to build dapps (decentralized applications). There are also debates on whether smart contracts need to be decentralized and whether a permissioned blockchain can be classified as smart contract platform.","There are two single-industry groups: Multi-Chain/Parachain and Single Chain.","The Multi-Chain/Parachain industry includes smart contract platform assets that enable multiple parallel blockchains and cross-chain interoperability. The platform can be structured with a relay chain that allows slots for external parallel chains, or parachains.","The Single Chain industry includes layer 1, or base, blockchain in which all transactions are recorded on the primary distributed ledger. The Single chain allows for layer 2, or companion, scaling systems that remain tied to the primary blockchain for transactional competency.","At present, CoinDesk Indices offers two indices based on the SCP sector. The flagship index is the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Index (SCPX) that constitutes a diversified basket of smart contract platform assets with ETH making up 73% of its portfolio from its market cap weighting. However, many investors who already hold ETH do not look for that much exposure to it.","Therefore, the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Ex ETH Index (SCPXX), which is just like SPCX but without ETH, offers flexibility to investors to get exposure to assets in the smart contract platform to complement their existing positions in ETH. Alternatively, SCPXX can be used simply to get exposure to the smaller assets inside the SCP sector. The two, taken together, can be analyzed for insights on performance between ETH and the rest of the sector.","The digital assets in the SCP sector indices are determined by eligibility criteria for investability and liquidity that have the following requirements:","� Ranked in the top 200 of the DACS universe","� Listed on eligible exchanges for at least 30 days","� Supported by eligible custodians","� Market cap is higher than the median of the top 20 eligible assets","� Median daily trading volume over the past 30 days is higher than the median of the top 20 eligible assets","The SCP sector tends to foster a rich environment for innovation that attracts a high level of development and resources. These platforms leverage network effects, decentralized consensus mechanisms and compatibility with various programming languages that enable creative and innovative developers to build protocols for a wide range of purposes such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.","The SCP sector serves as a foundation for the digital economy as the dapps built on these platforms attract numerous users, empowering individuals to take greater ownership over their finances and transactions and creating a burgeoning economy with a wide range of opportunities. They also facilitate a positive reinforcement cycle through the network effect.","The SCPX and SCPXX indices offer investors greater transparency into the sector, offering essential intelligence needed to allow them to express their views by making decisions and executing more efficiently.","To find out more about DACS and its indices, contact us at info@coindesk-indices.com.","Relevant indices","Smart Contract Platform Index (SCPX)","Smart Contract Platform ex-ETH Index (SCPXX)","Index-linked products","Smart Contract Platform ex-ETH Index (SCPXX) underlies the Grayscale� Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund","Disclaimer:","CoinDesk Indices, Inc.

Much of it is the FTT token issued by FTX, another Bankman-Fried company.","title":"Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried�s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda�s Balance Sheet","content":["Billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried�s cryptocurrency empire is officially broken into two main parts: FTX (his exchange) and Alameda Research (his trading firm), both giants in their respective industries.","But even though they are two separate businesses, the division breaks down in a key place: on Alameda�s balance sheet, according to a private financial document reviewed by CoinDesk. (It is conceivable the document represents just part of Alameda.)","That balance sheet is full of FTX � specifically, the FTT token issued by the exchange that grants holders a discount on trading fees on its marketplace. While there is nothing per se untoward or wrong about that, it shows Bankman-Fried�s trading giant Alameda rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, not an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto. The situation adds to evidence that the ties between FTX and Alameda are unusually close.","Read the latest: Binance Is Strongly Leaning Toward Scrapping FTX Rescue Takeover After First Glance at Books: Source","The financials make concrete what industry-watchers already suspect: Alameda is big. As of June 30, the company�s assets amounted to $14.6 billion. Its single biggest asset: $3.66 billion of �unlocked FTT.� The third-largest entry on the assets side of the accounting ledger? A $2.16 billion pile of �FTT collateral.�","There are more FTX tokens among its $8 billion of liabilities: $292 million of �locked FTT.� (The liabilities are dominated by $7.4 billion of loans.)","�It�s fascinating to see that the majority of the net equity in the Alameda business is actually FTX�s own centrally controlled and printed-out-of-thin-air token,� said Cory Klippsten, CEO of investment platform Swan Bitcoin, who is known for his critical views of altcoins, which refer to cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin (BTC).","Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison declined to comment. FTX didn\u0027t respond to a request for comment.","Other significant assets on the balance sheet include $3.37 billion of �crypto held� and large amounts of the Solana blockchain�s native token: $292 million of �unlocked SOL,� $863 million of �locked SOL� and $41 million of �SOL collateral.� Bankman-Fried was an early investor in Solana. Other tokens mentioned by name are SRM (the token from the Serum decentralized exchange Bankman-Fried co-founded), MAPS, OXY and FIDA. There is also $134 million of cash and equivalents and a $2 billion �investment in equity securities.�","Read the latest: Bitcoin Falls Below $17K, First Time in 23 Months, as Binance Said to Waver on FTX Deal","Also, token values may be low. In a footnote, Alameda says �locked tokens conservatively treated at 50% of fair value marked to FTX/USD order book.�","Owners of the FTT token get discounts on FTX trading fees, increased commissions on referrals and earn rewards. The value of FTT is maintained by FTX�s rolling program of buying back and burning tokens, a process that eats up a third of the exchange�s trading commissions, which will continue until half of all tokens are burned, according to FTX.","There are about 197 million FTT tokens worth $5.1 billion in circulation, according to FTX�s website.","Tracy Wang and Oliver Knight contributed reporting to this story.","UPDATE (Nov. 2, 2022, 15:00 UTC): Adds that Alameda\u0027s CEO declined to comment, and a comment from Cory Klippsten.","Edited by Nick Baker."],"create_date":"2022-11-02T14:44:22.018Z","tag":"Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research, FTX, Exclusive ","author":"Ian Allison"}

The BTC price was down 14% on the day, the biggest plunge in almost five months.","title":"Bitcoin Hits 2-Year Low Below $16K After Binance Backs Out of FTX Deal","content":["Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to its lowest level in two years on Wednesday as crypto traders processed the news that Binance exchange retreated from an earlier plan to buy its once-mighty but suddenly ailing rival FTX.","The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index fell to $15,625, the lowest since November 2020, after Binance said that, after conducting due diligence on FTX, it would not go through with the deal. BTC was down 14% on the day, the biggest single daily drop since mid-June.","Binance on Tuesday said it would buy the billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried�s FTX after what appeared to be a severe run on deposits but backed out on Wednesday afternoon citing \"mishandled funds and alleged U.S. agency investigations.\"","The fear among crypto traders is that the distress at FTX or at Bankman-Fried\u0027s trading firm, Alameda Research, might lead to forced selling, potentially hitting not just the FTX\u0027s own exchange token, FTT, but other cryptocurrencies from bitcoin to ether and Solana\u0027s SOL.","\"This is another one of those catalysts,\" said Bob Iaccino, Path Trading Partners co-founder and chief market strategist. \"I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if bitcoin went as low as $9,000, which for me, as someone who got out of bitcoin and is waiting to get in again, would actually be a positive.\"","Read More: Crypto Exchanges Scramble to Compile \u0027Proof-of-Reserves\u0027 as FTX Contagion Grips Markets","CoinDesk reported previously that the balance sheet of Alameda Research, also under Bankman-Fried\u0027s control, was heavily weighted toward the FTX exchange\u0027s own token, FTT � signaling billions of dollars of exposure for which there might not be ample buyers, and thus prone to steep losses in the event of a sell-off.","Binance described its initial agreement as a non-binding letter of intent, and executives said the deal would be subject to due diligence.","\"I still believe crypto is here to stay but these things need to clean out before you can do serious investments in the space, especially from a traditional finance perspective,\" Iaccino said.","Read More: \u0027Long\u0027 Crypto Traders Take on $700M in Losses as Markets Falls on FTX Contagion Fears","The downward move in bitcoin reverberated in traditional markets on Wednesday, where at one point the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) briefly had to halt transactions as the underlying BTC futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plunged � in turn triggering a stock-exchange circuit breaker on the ETF.","Trading quickly resumed but the incident showed the sudden viciousness that has reappeared in crypto markets following months of seemingly rangebound trading in bitcoin around $20,000.","UPDATE (Nov. 9, 21:53 UTC): Updates BTC price and latest Binance news."],"create_date":"2022-11-09T16:13:58.888Z","tag":"Bitcoin, Markets, FTX, Trading, Investing, Binance","author":"Helene Braun"}

Other Employees Have Lots of Questions","content":["\"Shocking\" is a word that aptly describes the rapid fall of Sam Bankman-Fried�s cryptocurrency empire. To a surprising degree, it�s a sentiment that pours out from people who worked for him, people who you�d think would�ve had a clue.","How can that be? It may have something to do with a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas. That�s where 30-year-old Bankman-Fried is roommates with the inner circle who ran his now-struggling crypto exchange FTX and trading giant Alameda Research.","Many are former co-workers from quantitative trading firm Jane Street, others he met at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his alma mater. All 10 are, or used to be, paired up in romantic relationships with each other. That includes Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, whose firm played a central role in the company\u0027s collapse � and who, at times, has dated Bankman-Fried, according to people familiar with the matter.","CoinDesk spoke to several current and former FTX and Alameda employees who agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity, citing ongoing harassment and death threats due to the exchange�s solvency issues. And they said essentially this: It�s a place full of conflicts of interest, nepotism and lack of oversight.","�The whole operation was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas,� a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity.","FTX and Alameda employees CoinDesk interviewed say they have been kept in the dark about the events of the past week, adding that only CEO Bankman-Fried�s inner circle may have had knowledge that the exchange, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, siphoned customer funds into corporate sibling Alameda.","�It�s been radio silence from Sam,� a second Bankman-Fried employee told CoinDesk on Wednesday. �When we saw the CZ [CEO Changpeng Zhao] tweet saying Binance was going to buy FTX, we honestly thought it was fake. But then Sam�s tweet just confirmed it.�","Bankman-Fried finally addressed employees later on Wednesday � a week after a CoinDesk article set the crisis in motion � writing, �I completely understand if you want to step away,� per an internal message to employees viewed by CoinDesk.","Among his nine housemates are FTX co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang, FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and Ellison of Alameda, Bankman-Fried�s trading business that�s at the center of the current chaos and on which the Wall Street Journal reported got $10 billion of FTX customer money. The remaining six are also FTX employees.","�Gary, Nishad and Sam control the code, the exchange\u0027s matching engine and funds,� the first person familiar with the matter said. �If they moved them around or input their own numbers, I\u0027m not sure who would notice.\"","A third person familiar with how the company operated said: �They�ll do anything for each other.�","Bankman-Fried and Ellison did not respond to a request for comment sent directly to them. Wang and Singh could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for FTX was also asked to pass on CoinDesk�s request for comment to Bankman-Fried, Ellison, Wang and Singh.","Bankman-Fried�s father, Stanford Law professor Joseph Bankman, also plays a role at the company. He appeared on an episode of the \"FTX Podcast\" in August, describing charity and regulation-related projects in which he was involved in for the company.","Wang, Singh and Ellison also comprise the board of Bankman-Fried�s FTX Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the company. Several housemates, including Bankman-Fried and Ellison, are active participants in effective altruism, a movement that �aims to find the best ways to help others,� possibly through philanthropy.","In the Bahamas, FTX and Alameda�s offices are also located steps apart in a coworking compound that also housed Solana developers and other crypto incubation projects.","�All of the stakeholders would have a hard look at FTX governance,� tweeted Bankman-Fried on Thursday. �I will not be around if I\u0027m not wanted.�","While some FTX employees have voiced approval for Bankman-Fried�s more frequent communication of late, others are not so consoled.","�Some employees kept their life savings on FTX,� the second anonymous employee told CoinDesk. �We trusted that everything was fine.�","Edited by Nick Baker."],"create_date":"2022-11-10T22:00:00Z","tag":"FTX, Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried, Exclusive , Bahamas","author":"Tracy Wang"}
