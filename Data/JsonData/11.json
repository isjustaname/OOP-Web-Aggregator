In other words, traders participate in the market by determining the price of one currency against another currency.","It’s a lot simpler than it sounds. For example, if you have ever travelled overseas you have likely made a forex transaction. For instance, if you travel from the US to most of the European countries and you want to have cash in you instead of just credit cards, you would have to exchange your dollars for euros – the currency used in the EU. This is basically a forex transaction. Now, imagine spending 1 dollar to get 0.5 euros (not an accurate comparison – solely for educational purpostes). By the time your vacation ends, the dollar might have become more expensive against the euro, which means that when you exchange your euros back to dollars, you will receive less.","This is how forex trading works in a nutshell. The forex market is, of course, global, and it’s comprised of a range of different currency pairs that you can trade with.","In this regard, forex trading looks a lot like cryptocurrency trading, but instead of digital currencies, you use fiat.","A forex broker is an entity which would provide you with access to a trading platform which allows you to buy or sell currencies. A forex Bitcoin broker is the same company but it would also have to allow you to trade Bitcoins. A wide range of the forex brokers have already adopted cryptocurrency trading and offer their users access to the market. These are also referred to as cryptocurrency forex brokers.","The forex market is incredibly liquid and it has an immense daily trading volume. This provides certain benefits for those who want to make money out of it. Of course, it is absolutely critical to understand that forex trading bears a significant risk warning and it’s best to consult with a professional before putting any of your money in.","The benefits of trading forex include:","Incredible Liquidity","Liquidity is a term used to describe the ability of an asset to be quickly converted into cash without any price discount. In terms of trading forex, this means that traders can move substantial amounts of money in and out of foreign currencies with minimal movement of the price.","Traditionally Low Transaction Costs","The tranasction costs of trading forex are typically incorporated within the price. There is a term for that – it’s called spread. It refers to the difference between the buying and the selling price.","Traders Can Use Leverage","Forex brokers usually allow traders to use leverage. This is the ability to trade more money on the market in comparison to what you actually hold in your account. Imagine having $10 in your account and there is a leverage trading provided by your forex broker capped at 10:1. This means that you can trade $10 for every $1 you have in your account. In this case, you’d be able to control a trade of $100 using only your $10 capital.","Risk warning is in place because leverage trading could see your account drained a lot quicker.","Constant Action","The forex market doesn’t have a directional trading restriction. In other words, if you think that a currency pair such as USD / EUR will increase in value, you can either buy it or go long. On the other hand, if you think USD / EUR will decrease in value, you are free to sell it or go short.","There is a lot of action going on the forex market, simply because there is a tremendous amount of currency pairs you can trade with. Of course, it would depend on which ones your trading platform supports.","Naturally, Forex trading also has its disadvantages. These include:","Serious Risk Factor","Much like cryptocurrency trading, forex trading carries a serious amount of risk. Price uncertainty is constant. Professional traders take advantage of technical analysis, and a whole lot of trading instruments in order to minimize their risk. Technical analysis, however, is not that easy to understand and it requires a lot of expertise.","Volatility is High","If you want to start trading, prepare for serious volatility. This is also associated with serious risk. While the upside potential is undoubtedly there, you can also lose a lot of money pretty quickly.","Low Barrier to Entry and Lack of Knowledge","Cryptocurrency trading, as well as forex trading, are becoming particularly accessible and, what is more – popular. The low barrier to entry means that anyone, irrespective of whether they have any prior knowledge or not, can enter the market and lose their money.","A few forex brokers also offer the so-called binary options. This is one of the trading instruments which allows traders to capitalize on short-term price fluctuations. In other words, it allows you to decide whether a certain currency pair like, for example GBP / USD will go up or down in value. If GBP /USD goes up and that’s what you’ve traded, you get a pre-determined return on your investment. Binary options trading is also incredibly risky and bears a lot of risks.","Choosing the best Bitcoin forex broker would require you to go through a range of different characteristics. These include:","For a more in-depth look at all of the above and more, you can take a look at our piece on the best bitcoin brokers, as the same considerations apply for the best Bitcoin forex brokers.","One particularly important thing to consider if you want to begin Bitcoin trading through a broker is to take a look at the payment methods. Different platforms have various payment options and you need to choose one which fits your needs.","eToro","eToro is a company founded back in 2007 and it’s amongst the best bitcoin forex brokers. One of the interesting trading instruments this Bitcoin forex broker provides is the ability to copy a trader. In other words, you would be able to mimic the trades of someone that you have confidence in.","There is no additional cost to it and the spreads remain the same, regardless of whether you are currently copying someone or you are trading manually on your own. It allows bitcoin trading.","As it is with the majority of forex brokers, eToro has demo accounts that users can take advantage of to test out the platform and ensure it provides all the trading instruments they might need.","There are plenty of payment methods as eToro is one of the most recognizable forex brokers. You can deposit and withdraw using PayPal, Skrill, Neteller, WebMoney, credit cards, bank transfers, and whatnot.","","","Moneta Markets","Moneta Markets are a regulated Forex and CFD broker that offers traders access to a range of the most popular Crypto CFDs, Forex pairs, Indices, Commodities and Share CFDs of some of the biggest companies in the world, all at the lowest possible costs.","With some of the lowest spreads in the industry across all instruments, traders can open an account in just minutes and deposit funds using 20+ different cryptocurrencies, and start trading their choice of 300+ CFD markets via the Moneta Markets next-gen WebTrader Platform, or the popular MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platforms.","The broker also offers all traders access to uncapped deposit bonuses, daily trading signals, a range of research and educational resources, and trading tools to help traders of all styles boost their edge, as well as 24/7 customer support.","Visit Moneta Markets to find out more!","","SimpleFX","SimpleFX is another forex broker which allows cryptocurrency trading and, respectively – Bitcoin trading.

Now, many exchanges recognize Bitcoin Cash ABC as Bitcoin Cash with a separate listing for Bitcoin SV. Let\u0027s take a look at how the Bitcoin Cash \u0027hash war\u0027 started and its implications moving forward.  The Bitcoin Cash hard-fork on November 15, 2018, resulted in two coins. In this article, we\u0027ll analyze the ABC vs. SV \u0027hash war.\u0027","title":"Bitcoin Cash ABC vs. Bitcoin Cash SV – Examining the Bitcoin Cash Hash War | Bitcoinist.com","content":["The Bitcoin Cash hard-fork on November 15, 2018, resulted in two coins. Now, many exchanges recognize Bitcoin Cash ABC as Bitcoin Cash with a separate listing for Bitcoin SV. Let’s take a look at how the Bitcoin Cash ‘hash war’ started and its implications moving forward.","Bitcoin Cash (BCH) came into existence in August 2017, but the fundamental argument behind its emergence traces back to the origins of Bitcoin (BTC) itself – the scalability debate. It was the inability to come to a consensus over increasing the block size limit that ultimately made ‘Bitcoin Cash’ fork off the Bitcoin network.","As early as April 2009, the block size limit already formed a debating point on the Bitcointalk online forum. At the time, with Bitcoin still in its infancy, the 1MB block size limit meant that the blockchain would have problems scaling once the network effect grew (more nodes on the blockchain).","","However, throughout the early days, developers in the community like Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, and others, couldn’t seem to reach a consensus. Thus, by the time Bitcoin achieved mainstream status, the 1MB “attributed” to Satoshi Nakamoto block size limit was considered “de facto.” Nevertheless, proponents of the 1MB limit argue that larger blocks would ultimately prevent individuals from running their own full nodes as only large-scale datacenter would be able to verify transactions in the future, resulting in centralization of the network.","Fast forward to 2017 with the BTC price and popularity growing; the network began to experience transaction backlogs. Around May 2017, some users complained of having to wait several days before their transactions could be confirmed on the network.","Preference was given to transactions with higher fees. Thus, BTC appeared ill-suited for microtransactions. This situation caused serious debates within the community with two main approaches suggested – Bitcoin Unlimited and Segregated Witness (SegWit).","Bitcoin Unlimited meant completely removing the block size limit. It also meant that the network would have to hard-fork, which is considered to be a riskier approach since the software client would no longer be backward compatible with older versions.","Miners like Bitmain preferred raising the block size limit as SegWit (Segregated witness), would expose the mining giant’s covert ASIC-boosting algorithms. However, those in opposition argued that the move would centralize Bitcoin mining by forcing out smaller, independent miners.","It must also be noted that SegWit also raised the block size limit, or to be more specific the ‘block weight’ to 4MB. In fact, the blocks mined by the Bitcoin network today are regularly over 1MB compared to Bitcoin Cash whose mined blocks are much smaller on average.","With SegWit, part of the transaction data is stored outside the blockchain creating room for more transactions inside a single block. Proponents argued that is a safer approach (compared to a hard-fork) that also increases throughput capacity. Critics, however, described the approach as only a palliative measure that did little to solve the core problem.","On August 1, 2017, the majority of Bitcoin miners signaled for the implementation of SegWit2x – an agreement among predominant Bitcoin companies (BitPay, Coinbase etc.) to implement SegWit and later raise the block size limit to 2MB (hence the “2x”).","However, a User Activate Soft Fork (UASF) eventually proved that Bitcoin full-nodes (i.e. users) are ultimately in control since it is they who actually verify and/or reject transactions based on the Bitcoin protocol.","Nevertheless, Bitcoin Cash developers elected to increase the block size limit to 8MB meaning more transactions could fit into a single block. This, however, went against the Bitcoin protocol as the vast majority of nodes supported SegWit while leaving the 1MB limit intact.","Bitcoin Cash forked away from the original Bitcoin blockchain on August 1, 2017, implemented replay protection, and quickly entered the top-ten cryptocurrency rankings based on market capitalization. This also meant that bitcoin holders also received an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH).","The opposing views that resulted in the 2017 Bitcoin Cash hard fork hinged on two distinct economic classifications – Bitcoin as an investment asset and Bitcoin as a payment system – or at least which should be prioritized first. The BCH brigade maintained that Satoshi’s vision was that Bitcoin must become a cheaper and quicker alternative to fiat payments despite centralization concerns.","On August 20, 2018, Bitcoin Cash Adjustable Blocksize Cap (Bitcoin Cash ABC, BCH ABC), which at the time was the largest software client for the blockchain, announced a hard fork slated for November 15, 2018. A part of the announcement read:","A new opcode called OP_CHECKDATASIG that improves the BCH scripting language to permit the validation of messages from outside the blockchain.","The introduction of canonical transaction ordering.","Several minor technical fixes and improvements.","This ‘upgrade’ had two main goals, the introduction of non-cash transactions like smart contracts and oracle prediction services on the blockchain, as well as canonical transaction ordering to replace topological transaction ordering.","Again, not everyone supported the changes in the source code with opponents criticizing the prioritization of non-cash transactions in a blockchain that they felt ought to deal with payments only. With the emergence of two opposing views, it appeared that another blockchain split was on the horizon.","Dr. Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre were among the most prominent opponents of the protocol updates proposed by BCH ABC.","","Craig Wright earned potentially eternal notoriety in the cryptocurrency industry when he claimed to Bitcoin creator – Satoshi Nakamoto. Calvin Ayre, on the other hand, is a billionaire and the CEO of Coingeek, one of the major BCH mining pools.","For Ayre, his miners don’t support canonical ordering of transactions and so, opposed the protocol change. The Coingeek CEO also called for increasing the block size limit to 128MB. Wright for his part didn’t see the value of incorporating smart contracts and oracles into the blockchain.","Roger Ver and Jihan Wu were on the other side of the conflict. Roger Ver is the owner of Bitcoin.com and was one of the first Bitcoin evangelists who turned into an apostle of Bitcoin Cash. Roger Ver has been heavily criticized for using his Bitcoin.com platform to trick people into thinking Bitcoin Cash is the “original Bitcoin” while labeling Bitcoin (BTC) as ‘Bitcoin Core’ – the name of the most popular Bitcoin software client.","Jihan Wu is the co-founder of Bitmain, which apart from being the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer, also owns BTC.com and Antpool, which control a significant portion of the Bitcoin hash rate.","","As November 15, 2018, drew closer, so did the vitriol which became apparent all over cryptocurrency and blockchain news media. The situation was rife with the usual mix of name calling and outright threats. Wu, the co-founder of Bitmain reported called Wright ‘Fake Satoshi,’ referring to the latter’s claim of being the Bitcoin creator. They also blocked or unfollowed opposing actors on several social media platforms.","With the Wright/Ayre coalition insistent on their rejection of BCH ABC, nChain released Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (Bitcoin SV, BSV). Wright argued that Bitcoin SV embodied Nakamoto’s original vision for Bitcoin. The company created an SV mining pool with miners onboarded in September.","For the anti-BCH ABC brigade, the SV client established Bitcoin Cash as a payment protocol. With such heavyweight owners of mining pools backing two different Bitcoin Cash clients, the ‘hash wars’ that followed saw both factions vying for the right to claim the BCH ticker post-hard fork.","The D-day – November 15 finally arrived, and the hard-fork resulted in a split, resulting in BCH ABC and BCHSV. Thus, commenced the next stage of the saga; “The Hash Wars – ABC vs. SV.” Both parties, desperate to exert dominance over the other by computing power, concentrated the bulk of their miners to their respective chains.","The heated contest even saw Roger Ver direct Bitcoin.com pool hash power from BTC mining to BCH mining to give his side the edge. The goal – win the hash race by becoming the longest chain, i.e., producing more blocks.","These actions were not without consequences, however, as it soon became apparent that there would be losses on both sides. Barely a week after the hash rate war, Bitcoinist reported that both sides had burned $12 million to sustain their mining operations, which were unprofitable as the price of BCH fell to record lows.","The BTC price also tanked along with the entire cryptocurrency market falling to its lowest level in over a year by market cap. Some commentators attributed the price crash to these so-called ‘hash wars’ particularly after Craig Wright threatened that he’d sell a lot of BTC to fund mining costs.","According to Coin Dance, a cryptocurrency data aggregator platform, the ABC faction continues to push ahead of SV based on hashing power – total Proof of Work (PoW) post-hard fork. Major cryptocurrency exchange platforms like Coinbase, Bittrex, Bitstamp, and Kraken began to assign the BCH ticker to the ABC chain.","Many exchanges halted trading on BCH altogether during the onset of the war as no replay protection was implemented. Without replay protection, a transaction would be valid on both chains resulting in chaos and disruption. As it became clear that ABC was ‘winning,’ cryptocurrency hardware wallet, Ledger resumed support for BCH. The hardware wallet company, however, didn’t add support for BSV to criticism from SV supporters who claimed that these companies were choosing favorites despite SV having a higher hash rate (from time to time).","Then Ayre came out on November 23 stating that SV was ready to put an end to the conflict by adding replay protection, which would prevent double-spending on both chains. With this move, those on the fence had to now ‘pick a side,’ as the cryptocurrency landscape now had two versions of Bitcoin Cash.","On CoinMarketCap, the ABC chain is now recognized as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Craig Wright’s chain as Bitcoin Cash SV (BSV) [coin_price coin\u003dbitcoin-sv], thought Ayre and Wright maintain that BSV is the ‘original Bitcoin.’","While the ABC vs. SV hash war may be coming to a close, there isn’t any indication of a cessation of hostilities between both camps. Presently, BCH is only marginally above Stellar based on market cap.","One critical event to look out for is the next scheduled Bitcoin Cash hard-fork ‘upgrade.’ It will be interesting to see if the Bitcoin Cash community keeps this strategy moving forward, however. As we have seen, regularly scheduled hard-forks may not always be the safest approach to ‘upgrading’ the protocol.","What do you expect will happen next in the Bitcoin Cash hard fork saga? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.","Images courtesy of Bitcointalk, BBC, Casino.org, Entrepreneur.com, Youtube (crypto zombie), and Fortune"],"create_date":"2018-12-03T05:00:30-05:00","tag":"bitcoin cash","author":"Bitcoinist"}

As the hearing unfolded, it became increasingly clear that the fallen crypto mogul could be handed the harshest punishment.","During the live coverage of the sentencing by Inner City Press, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan’s remarks shed light on the severity of Bankman-Fried’s crimes. The judge adopted the pre-sentence report and addressed the substantial disputes surrounding the sentencing guidelines.","Judge Kaplan pointed out that investors, lenders, and customers were all victims of Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent activities. These crimes included misappropriating FTX customer funds for speculative investments by Alameda and engaging in illicit activities. The judge emphasized that any fortuitous gains from the rise in cryptocurrency values did not diminish the gravity of the offenses committed.","Regarding the loss amount, Judge Kaplan stated that the loss exceeded the $550 million threshold, with investors losing $1.7 billion, lenders losing $1.3 billion, and customers suffering losses of $8 billion.","Additionally, the judge found Bankman-Fried guilty of obstruction of justice, citing his text messages to the former general counsel as attempted witness tampering. Based on the trial testimony, the judge also made three perjury findings, highlighting Bankman-Fried’s false statements regarding his knowledge of Alameda’s use of FTX customer funds.","As Sam Bankman-Fried addressed the courtroom, he expressed remorse for his actions’ impact on FTX customers and colleagues. He acknowledged the losses suffered by customers and their prolonged wait for resolution. Bankman-Fried also mentioned the dangers faced by Alameda and his efforts to salvage the situation, including receiving an “anonymous” message offering advice.","Bankman-Fried acknowledged his understanding of how the prosecutors perceived him, the court, and the media, referencing his earlier attempts to help the general counsel.","Sam Bankman-Fried expressed regret for not being able to do more to ensure that customers, lenders, and investors were appropriately compensated. Despite his statements, the judge’s remarks earlier indicated that the potential sentence could still be severe.","According to Inner City Press, the judge stated that Bankman-Fried’s guideline in the case is life imprisonment, which may amount to a maximum of 1,320 months (110 years).","The case has also been marred by tragic outcomes, with victims, such as Sunil, criticizing the liquidator for the handling of creditor’s rights and alleged suicides linked to the FTX fraud.","As this high-profile case reaches its conclusion, the crypto community awaits the final verdict that will determine Sam Bankman-Fried’s fate. His actions have left a significant impact on investors, lenders, and customers alike.","Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"],"create_date":"2024-03-28T10:33:07-05:00","tag":"crypto","author":"Ronaldo Marquez"}

DTX, a new presale crypto, has an impressive ongoing presale, cutting-edge trading features, and the potential for substantial gains even in a volatile market. It’s, therefore, no wonder that such a strong market leader would naturally influence ETH and SHIB investors. Here’s more!","\u003e\u003e\u003e BUY DTX TOKENS HERE \u003c\u003c\u003c","May 2024 saw a strong start for the global cryptocurrency market as investors heaped on cash inflows throughout the first week. But the market has not rallied as much since the first week of May ended, with bears erasing much of the earlier gains.","Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, felt the bearish pressure and saw a price decline, shedding some of its earlier highs. From the beginning of Q2 to the second week of May 2024, Ethereum’s (ETH) price declined by 21% from $3,648 to a low of $2,881.","The lacklustre performance of Ethereum (ETH) may be due to unfavorable perceptions and several setbacks regarding Ethereum ETF approval chances in the United States. Furthermore, the ongoing decrease in ETH open interest compared to spot market activity may hinder the possibility of Ethereum’s price surpassing $3,100 by the end of May 2024.","Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been one of the best-performing meme coins in 2024. In the first week of March, Shiba Inu’s price jumped by 338.49% to a high of $0.00004534 from its starting of the year amount of $0.00001034.","Consequently, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) market cap grew from $6 billion to $21 billion in the same period. However, things have not been so rosy for Shiba Inu in Q2 of 2024 as SHIB has traded below the $0.00003 price level, erasing most of its earlier gains.","Still, things look up for SHIB. Experts predict that the Shiba Inu coin burn in the second week of May could help push the price to the $0.00003 level by the end of May 2024. Conversely, a market downturn and a shift to a bearish outlook could see Shiba Inu (SHIB) tumble to $0.000022 in the same period.","Investors are increasingly drawn to the new presale token DTX Exchange (DTX) as they seek more stable investment opportunities amidst the uncertain future of Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). One of the reasons why DTX Exchange (DTX) stands out is its strong emphasis on security and wide range of features.","In addition, DTX Exchange (DTX) offers an inclusive platform that enables anyone to quickly start trading with its high leverage of 1000x. The signup process is straightforward, and there are no KYC requirements. In addition, the platform offers a DTX Wallet for secure cryptocurrency storage and various trading options for global equities.","The platform’s attractive features, such as lower trading fees, opportunities for governance participation, and the possibility of airdrops, make it an appealing option for individuals seeking to expand their cryptocurrency portfolio. In addition, DTX provides a trading platform that combines the advantages of decentralized and centralized exchanges, offering a wide range of features.","DTX Exchange (DTX) successfully raised over $2 million in its private/seed sale and an additional $100,000 in a public presale, all within an impressive two-day timeframe. Given the current token price of $0.04, investors eagerly anticipate a significant increase of 50% to $0.06 in the next stage.","Given its cutting-edge features and strong market position, DTX is well-positioned to take advantage of the changing dynamics resulting from the ETH and SHIB movements.

This can be seen from the various BTC- institutional-grade offerings","title":"How To Earn Bitcoin: The Definitive Passive BTC Income Guide","content":["Have you ever wondered how you can earn bitcoin passively in the modern crypto age? Well look no further, here is the perfect guide to help you get started.","Bitcoin has generated massive returns since it began publicly trading in 2010. BTC has had its bearish periods but the overall trend has remained very bullish. The graph below shows the market cap of Bitcoin from 2014 to date.","It is clearly evident that Bitcoin has garnered much prominence as an investable asset. This can be seen from the various BTC- institutional-grade offerings designed by key industry players like Bakkt and Fidelity, to involve Wall Street market participants.","BTC has gone through quite some market cycles to achieve the market valuation it currently possesses. Hence, it may not be financially viable for a lot of traders to buy large amounts of Bitcoin. Even buying fractions of BTC would require shelling out of generous amounts of cash.","In light of this, here is a list of alternative ways to generate passive income through earning free BTC just before the 3rd Bitcoin Halving in May 2020.","The master list","Working in exchange for BTC is the easiest and most legitimate way of earning bitcoin.","Whether you are a developer, designer, writer, translator, editor, internet marketer, freelancer or engineer, you can start working for Bitcoin right now.","","There are numerous platforms and websites that offer you bitcoin in exchange for your service.","Some of these platforms include:","Each bitcoin (BTC) is divisible up to8 decimal places, so each BTC can be split into 100,000,000 units. Each unit of bitcoin, or 0.00000001 BTC, is called a satoshi. A satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin.","One of the ways to earn bitcoin is to accumulate large amounts of Satoshis through trading altcoins/ all cryptocurrencies except BTC, and then convert them to bitcoin.","Every trading pair is formed as ALTxBTC, not ALTxUSD","When you’re buying and selling an altcoin in sats (Satoshis), if you sell when it’s up in USD but not sats, you end up inadvertently trading away your bitcoin. You must learn to trade relative to bitcoin, as accumulating satoshis is the only way to win this game. The key is to value bitcoin individually and not relative to USD.","Start: 100k sats is worth $5. Altcoin is worth 100k sats. You buy 1 altcoin at 100k sats.","Scenario 1: 100k sats are now worth $4. Altcoin is now worth 100k sats.","Scenario 2: 100k sats is now worth $6. Altcoin is now worth 100k sats.","Scenario 3: 100k sats is now worth $5. Altcoin is now worth 120k sats.","With #1, Altcoin is down 20% in USD but you’ve stayed the same in satoshi value. Which means you have the same value as Bitcoin. Which is good!","With #2, you’re up 20% in USD but not Satoshi. Which means you have the same value as Bitcoin. Which is again good!","With #3, you’re up 20% in satoshi, but the same in USD. Which is better!","Since the value of BTC is higher than USD, always trade in Bitcoin or Satoshi and you reap more profits.","This example highlights the issues in valuing crypto assets in USD. #3, you’d realize your Satoshi gains by converting to BTC. #1\u0026 #2 there are no conversions to be made as your sats are the same, but #2, people trading USD value may make a trade, and see a gain in USD but with Bitcoin value, they have neither booked a profit nor a loss. To people trading, USD value for #2 \u0026 #3 are actually the same, even though the alt is going from $5 to $6 in USD.","The difference is that in #3 the alt is outpacing BTC growth, which is the outcome we are looking for while in #2 it’s just pacing the same as BTC. #2 is not a trade to be made.#3 is the only trade to be made.","","Ebates, a popular Google Chrome Extension, offers customers cash-back for their purchases from thousands of websites. They work with almost all major online retailers, including everything from Best Buy to Groupon, to Nike. Once you install the extension and create an account, Ebates will notify you if there are discounts available while you browse a retailer’s website. In one click you can activate the discounts. At the end of every quarter, you get a check from Ebates with your cashback balance. It’s that simple.","In crypto, a company called Lolli is offering similar services. Make purchases on websites like Sephora, Macy’s, CVS or any of the 500+ partner stores, and get cash-back in Bitcoin. Every store has a different incentive amount. Some offer as much as 9% cash-back. Others will offer a set amount of BTC. This is a very easy way to earn free Bitcoin while making your everyday purchases.","Other similar apps are:","Certain companies will pay you (in Bitcoin or fiat) if you invite paying customers on to their platforms. This marketing method, called “affiliate marketing,” has been around for a long time and allows users to establish an additional income stream.","There are different structures provided by firms for their affiliate programs. With a lot of e-commerce brands, you can earn a percentage on your referred customer’s total order amount. For others, you may get a set fee for every person who signs up for a service using your promo code.","Few referral programs offered by well-established Bitcoin and crypto trading businesses are worth looking into this regard.","Binance boasts of harboring the globe’s most actively traded exchanges. It is one of the industry’s most trusted crypto trading platforms and regularly updates its services to give customers new trading opportunities. According to the Binance referral page, some of the top referrals have made commissions of 115 – 186 BTC.","How does the Binance Affiliate Program work?","Step 1: Sign up for a Binance Affiliate","Submit your application by filling a form. Their team evaluates your application and decides whether to approve it or not based on certain criteria.","Step 2: Create and Share your referral links","Create and manage your referral links from your Binance Account. You can track the performance for each referral link you share. These can be customized for each channel and for various discounts you would like to share with your community.","Step 3: Sit back, relax and earn commissions","When someone signs up or registers an account on Binance with your referral link, you can get up to 50% commission every time they complete a trade.","San-Francisco based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is one of the oldest and most well-known crypto trading platforms. Coinbase will pay you $10 for every customer who signs up and deposits at least $100. You also receive 50% of your referees’ trading fees for the first 3 months","Step 1: Become an affiliate","After you signed up and your application is approved, you’ll get access to promotional assets and Coinbase’s tracking software.","Step 2: Promote Coinbase","Link to Coinbase in articles, create new content or place ads on your website.","Step 3: Earn commissions","When new customers join Coinbase through your promotions, you earn a commission.","Changelly is one more known crypto exchange that provides a great affiliate program.

However, the court also sided with the US-based exchange on certain SEC claims regarding its wallet. As a result, the case will proceed, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing dispute.","The court’s decision stemmed from the SEC’s allegations that Coinbase facilitated transactions in crypto-asset securities without proper registration, violating Sections 5, 15(a), and 17A(b) of the Exchange Act.","The SEC contended that Coinbase acted as a marketplace, bringing together buyers and sellers of “crypto-asset securities”, while also serving as a custodian of securities through its wallet system. In this regard, the court denied the exchange’s motion to dismiss Counts I, II, and III of the complaint, affirming the SEC’s claims.","Furthermore, the court found that Coinbase’s parent company, CGI, could be held liable as a control person of Coinbase under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. It determined that CGI exercised power and control over the crypto firm, managing and directing its operations, thus denying Coinbase’s motion to dismiss Count IV.","Regarding the exchange’s Staking Program, the court agreed with the SEC’s argument that it constituted an investment contract under the Howey Test, making it subject to registration under the Securities Act. According to the ruling, the program allowed customers to stake various crypto assets, and the court found that Coinbase’s managerial efforts provided financial returns, meeting the definition of an investment contract.","As a result, the court concluded that the SEC adequately alleged the exchange’s unregistered offer and sale of securities, denying Coinbase’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.","However, the court granted Coinbase’s motion concerning the SEC’s claims concerning its Wallet application. While the SEC alleged that the crypto firm conducted brokerage activity through Wallet, the court found the factual allegations insufficient to support the inference that the exchange acted as an unregistered broker.","Finally, both parties are directed to submit a proposed case management plan by the court on or before April 19, 2024.","Commenting on the potential implications of this outcome, Edward Snowden wrote the following on his X account:","This doesn’t bother me. If the SEC keeps acting in bad faith like this, they’re going to lose so hard in court that they’ll never be able to do this to anyone ever again. Remember when the SEC got spanked so badly that Gensler had to approve BTC ETFs with tears in his eyes? yeah","Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"],"create_date":"2024-03-27T10:16:04-05:00","tag":"coinbase","author":"Ronaldo Marquez"}

With that said, the emergence of VPN use and/or cryptocurrency shows that online gambling even in countries where gambling is frowned upon is more popular than ever.","There are a number of online casinos across the globe that will welcome players from around the world with open arms. Thanks to reputable review sites like Bitcoincasinokings.com, getting updated information about crypto gambling is easy peasy.","All the latest information regarding the most popular crypto casinos, games, best bonuses and what crypto is allowed at each casino is at your fingertips and only a click away. As you can understand, the amount and level of detailed information you can get at these sites is priceless.","Just a heads up, if you are planning on using a VPN, make sure it is allowed (check terms and conditions) or you may have some issues with your withdrawals.","We all have our favorite crypto and reasons for why that is. Roughly 15% of the US population (36.5 million) own some sort of digital coin. When it comes to using them as currency while taking a shot at the slot machines, Bitcoin and Ethereum are clearly the player favorites.","That doesn’t mean that other coins aren’t being used. Au contraire, but these are the ones sitting at the top of the list.","Playing casino games online is so much more than a chase for the quick buck and the fact that even the biggest winners keep coming back for more proves it.","So if online gambling, especially the crypto version, is so popular, what type of games are Americans turning to?","The two online casinos that allow cryptocurrency and have the most players from the US are Stake and Bitstarz. After taking a look at their most popular games, I came up with the following list of 3 that I will now share with you all.","This is a sugar rush at its finest and with the wins to go with it. There’s a reason why Sweet Bonanza is number one on this list and it is simply a colorful candy-land that will tickle your sweet tooth and fill your pockets. Luckily racking up winning combos on these reels doesn’t add to your calorie intake because players simply can’t get enough. Loaded with multipliers (21,100x), free spins and the ever-so-appealing ante bet make it easy to understand the game’s popularity.","Start spinning and start winning is all I have to say as you will find out soon enough what Sweet Bonanza is all about!","Greek mythology is one of the most popular themes when it comes to slots and considering the number of powerful Gods, it all makes sense. When it comes to the life of the divine, few places are as mythological as Mount Olympus. I personally enjoy the fact that you can click a button, cough up a 100x your bet and be off to the races and free spins. To be honest, I don’t see why all slots don’t have the buy option.","I’m also a big fan of the Ante Bet. By activating it, your stake will get a 25% increase but the chances of hitting the bonus rounds doubles so in my book it’s an easy decision. I keep it locked and loaded each and every spin to maximize my chances of winning. This is your chance to dance with the Gods!","Is it a coincidence that the top 3 most popular US crypto games come from Pragmatic Play? Who knows but the proof is in the pudding and I guess Pragmatic Play keeps serving players the good stuff. We can all use a boost of nutrients, especially these days, and Fruit Party will give you a chance to stock up on Vitamin-C and by C I mean cash. Get ready for a color explosion where you’ll be poppin’ clusters to a groovy soundtrack that will put you in the right mood.","The truth is that Fruit Party has been a popular slot for a long time, meaning it’s not a random game. Besides a ton of free spins, its success leans heavily on the tumble feature where a hot streak can keep things going for ages while the cash continues to roll in. Don’t threaten me with a good time, am I right? A lot of players still enjoy the old 3-reel fruit machines but I prefer the bigger grids and this game is sitting on a 7×7 monster which I think also adds to its popularity. You will be glad to see there’s a by option to take advantage of.","Don’t be surprised if you were to scoop up huge wins after just a few spins.","As you can see, the rules and restrictions surrounding online gambling will not be able to stand in the way of the online casino freight train. With crypto now making powerful strides, the interest surrounding the industry will continue to increase.","Just like you, I’m excited about what’s to come and one thing is for sure, crypto gambling in the USA is bigger and better than ever!","","About the Author: Jakob King is the founder of bitcoincasinokings.com where he reviews crypto casinos since March 2015.

With the constant influx of funds in the meme coin space, evident by the current $9 billion trading volume within the last 24 hours, crypto enthusiasts think that both KANG and FLOKI could be ready for a 50% price hike.","Not just any meme coin, FLOKI is a cryptocurrency with sound fundamentals that is poised to lead the field during the current bull run.

As the hearing unfolded, it became increasingly clear that the fallen crypto mogul could be handed the harshest punishment.","During the live coverage of the sentencing by Inner City Press, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan’s remarks shed light on the severity of Bankman-Fried’s crimes. The judge adopted the pre-sentence report and addressed the substantial disputes surrounding the sentencing guidelines.","Judge Kaplan pointed out that investors, lenders, and customers were all victims of Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent activities. These crimes included misappropriating FTX customer funds for speculative investments by Alameda and engaging in illicit activities. The judge emphasized that any fortuitous gains from the rise in cryptocurrency values did not diminish the gravity of the offenses committed.","Regarding the loss amount, Judge Kaplan stated that the loss exceeded the $550 million threshold, with investors losing $1.7 billion, lenders losing $1.3 billion, and customers suffering losses of $8 billion.","Additionally, the judge found Bankman-Fried guilty of obstruction of justice, citing his text messages to the former general counsel as attempted witness tampering. Based on the trial testimony, the judge also made three perjury findings, highlighting Bankman-Fried’s false statements regarding his knowledge of Alameda’s use of FTX customer funds.","As Sam Bankman-Fried addressed the courtroom, he expressed remorse for his actions’ impact on FTX customers and colleagues. He acknowledged the losses suffered by customers and their prolonged wait for resolution. Bankman-Fried also mentioned the dangers faced by Alameda and his efforts to salvage the situation, including receiving an “anonymous” message offering advice.","Bankman-Fried acknowledged his understanding of how the prosecutors perceived him, the court, and the media, referencing his earlier attempts to help the general counsel.","Sam Bankman-Fried expressed regret for not being able to do more to ensure that customers, lenders, and investors were appropriately compensated.

While DOGE holders are well aware of Dogecoin’s established position in the crypto market, their concerns have intensified with the impending launch of RETIK’s coin on May 21st. The prospect of RETIK potentially outperforming Dogecoin post-launch has sparked contemplation among DOGE holders, with some even considering switching their investments to the rapidly emerging altcoin, Retik. In this article, we’ll delve into the reasons behind these considerations and explore the implications for both DOGE and RETIK in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.","Retik Finance (RETIK) has ignited a flurry of discussions within the cryptocurrency market, posing a potential challenge to established players like Dogecoin. Unlike ordinary fast-rising coins, Retik stands out as a formidable contender poised for success. Its rapid ascent within the crypto sphere has positioned it as a viable competitor against numerous cryptocurrency predecessors. In the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi), Retik Finance is causing a significant stir. With a mission to empower individuals and democratize access to financial services, Retik offers a comprehensive range of DeFi products. This adaptability has attracted a growing community of individuals seeking greater control over their financial assets. In contrast, Dogecoin, primarily known as a meme coin, lacks real utility or function.","Retik Finance (RETIK) distinguishes itself from Dogecoin through its diverse range of financial services, including decentralized trading, borrowing, and lending. By providing users with access to liquidity and opportunities for passive income generation, Retik enhances the utility and value proposition of the RETIK token. One key advantage RETIK has over Dogecoin is its highly successful presale, which raised over $32 million. This achievement underscores Retik’s potential for growth and adoption within the cryptocurrency market. Analysts believe that Retik Finance (RETIK) possesses the capabilities to challenge Dogecoin’s dominance, especially with its early utility launch and increasing momentum and investor confidence. As the project continues to roll out new features and forge strategic partnerships, Retik Finance emerges as a formidable player capable of disrupting Dogecoin’s market position.","Retik Finance (RETIK) has experienced an impressive growth rate of over 400%. Despite this already remarkable trajectory, Retik has the potential to more than double its current growth rate following the announcement of its launch date as May 21, 2024. This anticipated launch has the potential to trigger a surge in Retik’s token prices, compelling Dogecoin holders to reconsider their investment strategies. Scheduled to launch on multiple exchanges and Uniswap at 12 pm UTC on May 21, Retik’s entrance into the market signals significant growth opportunities. The coin’s innovative DeFi solutions, coupled with its presale success, have positioned it as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency space. Many Dogecoin holders may find themselves tempted to shift their investments to Retik Finance, recognizing the potential for higher returns and unique market features. With its rapid ascent and promising prospects, Retik Finance presents investors with an enticing opportunity for substantial growth and lucrative returns.","The announcement of Retik Finance’s launch date has prompted Dogecoin holders to reassess their investments and contemplate a shift towards Retik as a more favourable option. With Retik poised for its official launch on May 21st, the coin is poised to make a significant impact on cryptocurrency history by establishing itself as a leading contender in the market.","Visit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):","Website: https://retik.com","Whitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf","Twitter: www.twitter.com/retikfinance","Telegram: www.t.me/retikfinance","","Disclaimer: This is a paid release.

Notably, MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) stock has doubled this year to an all-time high (ATH) of $1,195, surpassing the record gains of the largest cryptocurrency on the market. For context, at the end of 2014, MSTR was trading around $160.","The report notes that despite concerns that Saylor, as the controlling shareholder, may be selling at the peak, MicroStrategy’s stock’s performance has mitigated such worries among investors.","During a conference call in November, Saylor clarified that he had been paid a mere $1 salary over the past decade and was ineligible for cash bonuses. He explained that exercising the options would enable him to address certain obligations and acquire more Bitcoin for his account.","Lance Vitanza, a managing director at TD Cowen, commented that the media has perhaps emphasized the story more than investors, who acknowledge that Saylor still retains a substantial amount of MicroStrategy’s stock.","However, the premium that MicroStrategy commands over Bitcoin, particularly since the introduction of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold the cryptocurrency, has begun to raise eyebrows.","In March, Kerrisdale Capital Management LLC announced that it was shorting the stock, apprehensive that it was outpacing the surge in the digital asset’s price.","Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and a consultant for blockchain firms, questioned the rationale behind purchasing MSTR at a premium when ETFs are now available.","Campbell described MSTR as a “retail magical belief stock,” similar to Tesla TSLA, which often defies fundamentals and trades on sentiment. Campbell added that while this trend may continue for some time, it is not indefinite.","MicroStrategy reported a first-quarter loss of $53 million. Interestingly, this loss was incurred despite the surge in the value of its Bitcoin holdings.","According to the report, under current accounting rules, the company cannot recognize increases in the value of its Bitcoin holdings, including the nearly 67% jump in the recent quarter.","However, a recently passed accounting rule will require valuing digital assets at market prices, and companies have until 2025 to implement this revision. Instead of adopting the revision for the first quarter, MicroStrategy recorded a $191.6 million impairment loss related to its digital assets.","Since MicroStrategy began purchasing Bitcoin to hedge against inflation, its holdings’ value has risen to approximately $13.5 billion. During the first quarter, the company acquired an additional 25,250 Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 214,400 as of April 26.","Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a digital asset management firm, summarized Saylor’s strategy for MicroStrategy as follows: sell equity or debt and use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. As the value of Bitcoin appreciates, so does the price of MSTR stock, enabling the company to sell more stock or bonds and repeat the cycle.","Currently, BTC is trading at $61,200, down over 7% in the last seven days alone, after several failed attempts to consolidate above higher levels as selling pressure mounts.","Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"],"create_date":"2024-04-30T13:00:09-05:00","tag":"bitcoin","author":"Ronaldo Marquez"}

Everything You Need to Know | Bitconist","content":["Bitcoin mining is a term that everyone in the cryptocurrency and even many outsiders are familiar with. This is a process performed by high-powered computers (also known as nodes), which solve complicated computational math problems.","While distinct, there are certain similarities between bitcoin mining and actual mining for precious metals such as gold, for example. Both processes are carried out with the intention to earn a reward.","Furthermore, bitcoins actually exist in the bitcoin protocol but they haven’t been brought out yet – just as gold exists in the ground but it hasn’t been mined yet.","But the aim of bitcoin mining is, however, twofold. For once, when the above-mentioned high-powered computer or any other type of mining hardware, for that matter, successfully solves the complex math problem on the network of Bitcoin, they produce a new bitcoin.","On the other hand, by solving the computational math problems, bitcoin miners are actually making the payment network a secure through the proof-of-work consensus algorithm.","In order to break down bitcoin mining, there are a few important considerations that need to be taken into account.","Consumers tend to trust different types of printed fiat currencies because they are backed by central banks. In the US, for instance, this is the Federal Reserve. This is even true for digital payments made with fiat currencies.","Bitcoin, however, is not regulated by any central authority. It can be said that it is ‘backed’ by the computing power, which secures the network. This vast network of computers and mining hardware records transactions and make sure that they are accurate.","Unlike central authorities, however, bitcoin miners are spread throughout the entire world and record the transactional information on a public ledger available to anyone. This ledger can be viewed using a block explorer and there are many different websites that provide this service.","In other words, bitcoin mining is necessary for two different reasons – first, it is needed to create new bitcoin and second, it’s needed to confirm the transactional information. So, in theory, if you don’t want to buy Bitcoin, you can earn it through mining. Whether or not that’s efficient for you as an individual miner, however, is a different story.","","In order for a bitcoin miner to get block rewards, there are two conditions which need to be met. First, the miner needs to confirm a certain amount of transactions and second, which is the trickiest part, solve a complex computational math problem.","Put simply, if that’s at all possible, each miner is competing with all of the others to come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number which is referred to as a “hash” which is less than or equal to the hash which is targeted. In other words, the computer will be spitting out different hashes at a certain rate per second guessing all of the possible 64-digit numbers until they reach the correct solution.","Therefore, computational power is essential – the more powerful your mining equipment, the larger hash rate per second you’d be able to achieve. This is why the Bitcoin mining hardware is particularly important. Naturally, the cost of mining would be based on a the operation costs such as electricity, internet connection, hardware maintenance, and so forth.","This is the main reason for which back in 2013 bitcoin miners started to use machines which were specifically designed for mining cryptocurrencies. These are called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits or ASIC mining, for short. ASIC mining devices can cost a serious amount of money but are more efficient than traditional computers.","There are a few important things to be considered when it comes to BTC mining. These are some of its pillar components, so to speak.","One of the things to be aware of in the world of Bitcoin mining is blocks. Transaction data is recorded in files which are called blocks. Think of it as a page from your city’s recordbook. Blocks are organized into a chain in chronological order – hence, blockchain. New transactions, as they are being confirmed by miners, go into new blocks, with each new block is being added to the end of the chain. This is why blockchain is also referred to as records of blocks.","Is Bitcoin mining profitable? This is probably the most commonly asked question. Unfortunately, there is no one answer. Block rewards are what miners compete for. Other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, for instance, also have their own block rewards which differ from those of Bitcoin.","At inception, every single bitcoin block reward was worth 50 BTC. However, the protocol works in a way where the block reward is being halved after 210,000 blocks have been discovered. This takes roughly around four years to complete. As of July 9th, 2016, the reward for discovering one block is 12.5 BTC.","So is Bitcoin mining profitable? It depends. One would have to calculate the current block reward based on the current prices and compare that to the cost of mining, which varies from miner to miner.","It’s worth noting that the reward for successful Bitcoin miners will drop once again in May 2020 and it will decrease to 6.25 BTC per block from the current 12.5.","To put it in the most basic terms, hash rate represents the speed at which bitcoin mining hardware can guess the correct hash. Therefore, the faster your hash rate is the higher the chances of discovering the new block you have. BTC mining has become highly competitive and, as such, you need to consider getting powerful bitcoin mining hardware. Individual miners, can, on the other hand, take advantage of cloud mining or mine a coin with lower difficulty, but more on that later.","The difficulty of bitcoin mining is adjusted frequently in order to maintain an average time of about 10 minutes to process a block. The rate is recalculated every 2,016 blocks.","In case you wonder why ten minutes – it’s because bitcoin developers have decided that this is the time needed for a steady and diminishing flow of producing new coins.","When it comes to cryptocurrency mining, a mining pool is the combined resources by miners who are sharing their overall computational power over a network in order to split the reward equally based on the amount of work that they have contributed to discovering a new block.","A “share” would be awarded to each member of the mining pool who manages to present a valid partial proof of his work. Mining pools became popular as the difficulty of bitcoin mining increased over time and when it became apparent that individual miners could no longer compete with bigger pools and large-scale mining operations.","Cloud mining, on the other hand, is what allows individual miners to participate in the process without having to purchase particularly expensive bitcoin mining hardware.","If you want to take part in BTC mining but you don’t want to spend the time and resources to get powerful machines, you can use shared processing power provided by remote data centers. The only thing you’d need is a home computer. Generally, there are three types of cloud mining that you can take advantage of. These include:","You can lease a mining machine which is hosted by the provider.","This is a method which would require you to create a virtual private server and after that install your own mining software.","Cloud mining also allows you to lease a certain amount of hash power without having the best bitcoin mining hardware. This is likely to be the most popular method of all. Most of the providers offer comprehensive calculators that you can take advantage of to determine the current profitability based on the resources you are ready to spend.","However, it’s important to pay special attention when it comes to cloud mining as there are fraudulent service providers. It’s crucial to make proper and in-depth due-diligence, especially if you intend to lease hash power. One of the largest cloud Bitcoin mining companies out there is Genesis Mining.","Mining bitcoin is intentionally designed to be energy intensive. The computational power needed to solve the abovementioned complex math problems requires a lot of electricity to power up the specialized mining hardware.","On the flipside, it requires even more resources to attack the network than to defend it, making Bitcoin the most secure blockchain today.","","In fact, there is an entire pseudo-environmentalist brigade which aims to have the regular user believe that Bitcoin mining would somehow be the death of the planet. A lot of their arguments revolve around the fact that large data centers used for carrying out the math computations use tremendous amount of electricity. However, Bitcoinist recently outlined three reasons for which this rhetoric is complete nonsense.","According to clean energy researcher Katrina Kelly-Pitou, the entire debate on the overall electricity consumption by bitcoin mining facilities is headed in the wrong direction. The research outlines that electricity consumption can increase while, at the same time, have minimal impact on the environment. This is because those facilities gradually begin to use more efficient, sources of energy which are renewable. Not only does this make mining more profitable, but it also lowers the impact on the environment. The researcher also outlined that banks use three times more electricity than Bitcoin’s network.","What is more, a brand new report concluded that 80 percent of Bitcoin mining is running on renewable energy. This is unsurprising since miners are naturally incentivized to seek the cheapest and cleanest sources of energy, many of which are renewables such as hydroelectricity (e.g. Iceland).","If you’re worried about Bitcoin consuming too much energy, you might want to think twice about lighting up the Christmas lights this year. That’s right – the lights that American consumers alone use to decorate their homes for the occasion make up a gigantic 6.63 billion kilowatt hours of electricity consumption every single year. That’s more than the entire national energy consumptions of a lot of the developing countries every year. For example, both Ethiopia and El Salvador used less electricity per year.","However, if you decide to set up a mining rig in your garage, you can most definitely expect a more expensive electricity bill next month.","There are a few key parameters to look out for when it comes to choosing the best bitcoin mining hardware. These include:","Naturally, you want to be aware of how much electricity does your miner consume. The lower this number, the better.","As we explained above, the hash rate is essential for bitcoin mining. The larger this number is, the better the machine is, generally.","This measurement accounts for the efficiency of your machine. If this particular number is low, it means that the machine will consume less power for the same amount of work done by the machine.","There is a range of different devices produced by some of the largest companies in the field such as Bitmain Technologies, Canaan Creative, Halong Mining, Innosilicon Technology, and others of the kind.","Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency which can be mined. It’s worth noting, though, that if you are using a specialized cryptocurrency mining hardware you’d have to check the compatible digital currencies, as some of the devices would only allow you to mine selected cryptocurrencies. However, apart from Bitcoin, other popular choices include Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and so forth.","If you managed to make it thus far, you should have a general understanding of the main principles behind bitcoin mining and why it is essential to its network.","At the same time, bitcoin mining represents an alternative method to acquire the digital currency. Of course, if you don’t feel like investing time and efforts into it, let alone designating specialized bitcoin mining hardware, you can always check our detailed guide on to how to buy cryptocurrencies.","We’ve gone in depth on how to buy Bitcoin with Paypal, credit card, debit card, and even with cash. We’ve also covered some of the most popular platforms where you can buy Bitcoin.","Once you’ve done that, you can hop to our comprehensive guide to Bitcoin wallets and determine whether you want a web-based one or an offline, hardware solution instead.","What do you think of the process behind bitcoin mining?

It was built to accomplish a social mission - to make the world more open and connected","title":"Facebook: The Rise of a Giant and the Libra Cryptocurrency","content":["Facebook has wrapped up almost 16 years of history. Founded in 2004 chiefly as a social network company, Facebook initially launched to connect Harvard University students together. The company’s first steps happened at a notorious historical moment, with the first iteration starting off in a Harvard dorm room.","The company’s initial mission sounded innocent enough, based on the idea of connecting people through a single platform. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder, has mentioned in multiple variances.","Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission – to make the world more open and connected","In late 2019, Facebook counted almost 2.5 billion users worldwide, once again making it the largest social network. The connectivity and invitation algorithms expanded the number of users, leading to global network of people.","In the early 2000s, Facebook arrived just as MySpace and other ways to connect online were unraveling. With the possibility of sharing multiple media, building a Facebook profile was immediately appealing.","","The chief promise of Facebook is that its service is free, and always will be. Over the years, the company boosted its advertising revenues, while constant growth reflected on the market capitalization. Of course, the service did not go without revenues, as Facebook grew its ad outreach, harnessing algorithms to tailor content.","And it was precisely that tailored content, personalized tools and timelines which increased engagement. Facebook allowed each user to tweak the relevance of their information, honing in on the most important news from their own perspective. Zuckerberg has remarked on this phenomenon with a direct explanation on how he sees news relevance.","“A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa,” Zuckerberg has mentioned.","Facebook’s model is to apply this thinking to almost all news, in the end leading to constant engagement and user interest.","Facebook went public in 2012, when it had accrued over one billion users, a milestone for any company. The company debuted with 421 million shares, and was considered one of the biggest tech IPOs in history. After negotiating on a per-share range of between $28 and $38, Faccebook went public with a price of $26.81, sparking hopes for an ultra-growth valuation.","But the months after the IPO were underwhelming, as prices on the open market slid to around $19. But in the years after that, FB stock became one of the stars in the new tech boom. Part of the FAANG group of companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google), the shares were at the forefront of a new stock boom.","Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) now trades at $221.32, reaching new price records after a successful 2019. After the slump in the fall of 2018, which created fears the US bull market could break, the stock went on to have another successful year, climbing out of the lows near $124. Combined with user growth, and an expansion of 20% on earnings per share year-on-year, Facebook keeps itself in the spotlight.","The Facebook stock price took off in earnest after 2016. But that was also the time when the influence of Facebook was being questioned. It was precisely the news-tailoring algorithms which were taken to talks.","It turned out the business model of Facebook was not just centered around tailored advertising. It was also a monster data collector.","","The Cambridge Analytica scandal pointed out that pattern. Facebook had accrued massive amounts of data, as well as experience in sifting through it. Users, at that point, were also comfortable with the platform and would provide a constant flow of all manners of data – including geolocation, news preference, and other types of information.","At that point, Facebook contained multiple tools to tailor one’s account, and this also produced more data.","In the end, it turned out Cambridge Analytica used the data to tweak news and stories, with accusations arising that this tailored campaign ended up swaying the US election results in 2016, which allowed Donald Trump to become President.","The data collection happened at a time when regulations were lax on what could be done with user data. There was no explicit consent, and no regulation in place to make users realize that each one of their actions on Facebook generated data.","The harvesting also happened based on a private effort, as Cambridge Analytica was hired to gather data for US Senator Ted Cruz. But the effect of data collection and tailored content spread much further, possibly contributing to a narrative that led to voting in favor of Brexit.","The entire scope of the scandal was exposed in the spring of 2018, just in time to temporarily tank the FB stock price.","The data collection was done through an innocent-looking app, which curated users’ digital footprint. But the app also collected and stored data, which were later used within the scope of political campaigns.","The final count held that more than 78 million user profiles were affected, with the majority belonging to US-based accounts. Seemingly innocent data like birthdays, locations and a few other data points were used to create profiles, and tailor advertising and stories to those users. Those stories matched and, according to accusers, amplified certain political moods, which had nothing to do with news about squirrels or cute cat pictures.","Zuckerberg’s public involvement increased in the spring of 2018. The company’s founder had to explain to a worldwide audience, and even apologize about its data handling practices. The company ended up paying a small fine of $653,000 for the trespass, which was specifically about not safeguarding user data.","But the real scandal that affected Facebook was that the social network had the potential to boost certain phenomena. Fake news, believably-built stories produced in content farms in third-world countries, spread throughout the social network, leading countries like Germany to openly attack the platform’s potential for disseminating harmful content.","","The social media giant was also accused of enabling foreign meddling in election results, and having a general potential in its very mechanisms to sway public opinion.","And that potential has been realized with only a handful of the users. Despite calls to boycott Facebook, the social network still hosts billions of new accounts, from vastly different cultures, making it a global force.","Based on the most recent news, the data harvesting has not stopped. Data Propria, a company founded in 2018, has reportedly been tasked with working on the US election cycle in 2020, with the aim to boost the chances of President Trump’s re-election.","It was during the biggest crypto boom that Facebook set entirely different priorities. Initially, Facebook had little to do with Bitcoin or crypto assets, only exercising caution and banning crypto-related ads in early 2018.","At that point, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were going through their frenzy phase, and ads helped thinly concealed scams gather more users. Facebook moved in with an outright ban, which lasted for about a year.","For a while, the blowout of the Cambridge Analytica scandal took the forefront for all Facebook efforts. Cryptocurrencies were, at that point, a relatively minor issue.","The world of crypto was also going through a crunch, entering a two-year bear market that affected most assets. The entire 2018 was counted as a bad year in crypto, when the initial hype unraveled, and the promises of digital projects failed to materialize.","Overall interest in crypto assets diminished, including a dissipation of social media groups and overall searches. Hence 2018 was not the ideal year for crypto interest, and Facebook stood on the sidelines. In the meantime, multiple crypto startups came up with the idea of combining a social media platform with a crypto-based coin or token.","However, none of those projects had the resources to build a highly usable, popular platform. The biggest platform, Steemit, ended up firing most of its staff. The Steemit ecosystem also held an unfair advantage for early adopters, essentially becoming a pyramid scheme.","Other similar projects failed to take off, lacking the resources and runaway funding, as the bear market diminished the potential of startups.","Additionally, token-based projects lost their credibility, and Bitcoin became the leading field of speculation. All of those factors meant no big company wanted to touch crypto assets with any seriousness.","The biggest defect of crypto assets was their volatile price. Merchants soon found out Bitcoin was not the ideal tool for payments, as its price could be extremely volatile.","Soon, the idea of stablecoins appeared – an asset that kept its valuation intuitive at $1. At the same time, those assets allowed for fast, borderless transfers of value. Reportedly, their chief idea was to collect actual funds in dollars, store them in bank accounts, then issue the respective token that matches the value.","This initial idea was realized by Tether, Inc., one of the most notorious companies in the crypto space. Over the course of two years, Tether issued USDT tokens, claiming to reflect real interest in crypto investment. The growth of USDT supply also coincided with price booms for Bitcoin, leading skeptics to believe it was a direct effort to manipulate prices.","But the idea of stablecoins picked up, and was expanded upon by new startups. It was precisely the flaws of Tether which built the new generation of stablecoins. Those projects required customer screening and de-anonymization before taking in dollars and issuing new tokens. Projects like TrueUSD, Paxos, and USDC by Circle also tried to be compliant with the latest regulations.","Even the Winklevoss twins joined the stablecoin bandwagon. They are still supporting a relatively small stablecoin, Gemini USD (GUSD), mostly active on the Gemini exchange. The asset has shown that stablecoins can work even under the strict regulations of New York.","","This model turned rather successful for the crypto space, ushering in new forms of trading and access for both retail investors and large-scale buyers. Stablecoins had an international outreach, and relied on public blockchains to deliver the tokens anywhere around the globe.","In a world even more used to connectivity, stablecoins, especially USDT, were a lifeline. Those assets made it possible to acquire crypto coins and hold onto them without the price risk. Additionally, stablecoins offered a cheaper way to transfer funds worldwide, while avoiding some of the capital controls.","A stablecoin can be sent in minutes, also serving as a form of fintech solution, while avoiding the waiting time for bank transfers.","The utility of stablecoins was established at the time of relatively stagnant trading. Nevertheless, stablecoin projects appeared and started to spread through exchanges. When the bullish attitudes returned in 2019, the usability of stablecoins was even bigger, as they had already spread through exchanges.","Facebook’s Libra project was announced in June 2019, just after a few months of significantly improving performance on the cryptocurrency markets. Around that time, the Cambridge Analytica scandal had blown over in its worst.","So Facebook suddenly announced it would copy the stablecoin model, and introduce Libra, a digital coin complete with an ecosystem and a wallet. David Marcus was put at the helm of the project.","Facebook, it turns out, had copied multiple ideas from the crypto space. Beyond the idea of an asset-backed stablecoin, Facebook also waited for more innovation in building networks.","Facebook’s Libra, it became known, would not copy Bitcoin. Instead, it would resemble coins like TRON and EOS, which used a series of delegates to produce blocks. This approach is known as delegated proof-of-stake, and goes beyond mining and democratic staking. Instead, it allows big players to support a network and allocate resources.","Facebook, with its big influence, went further. It enlisted 27 big companies to participate in the Libra Association. Among the listed were large telecoms, as well as VISA, MasterCard, and a handful of other payment processing companies.","The announcement of Libra was initially greeted by the crypto market, unleashing a rally in most assets which lasted for a few months. It seemed Facebook, of all companies, would be the entity to spread the usage of digital assets into the mainstream.","But instead, Facebook’s Libra opened a can of worms. Worldwide, regulators quickly recalled the big influence of Facebook, and its effect during the years of data gathering and targeted content. Almost immediately, Mark Zuckerberg had to visit Congress once again, and explain the case for Libra.","Zuckerberg conceded that Libra would not launch without regulatory green light.","…Some have suggested that we intend to circumvent regulators and regulations. We want to be clear: Facebook will not be launching the Libra payments system in any part of the world unless all U.S. regulators approve it. And we support Libra delaying its launch until it has fully addressed all U.S. regulatory concerns","The initial plan was for Libra to launch in early 2020. But so far, there is little clarity on what regulators intend to do. Libra has been ready with a plan to base its value on a basket of global currencies, with a prevalence of the US dollar (50%), but also including the euro (18%), yen (14%), British pound (11%), and Singapore dollar (7%).","Libra has been running as a testnet token, inviting developers to add use cases. The Calibra wallet has been created, though it is useless without the mainnet token launch.","According to David Marcus, the Libra project will aim to build a new protocol for money, and still sticks to its original purpose to give access to the unbanked.","The Libra Association is still gathering new members, with no strict timeline on when they would become block producers. The entity has gained regulatory approval in the canton of Zug, Switzerland, thus making use of the regulatory climate in what has become known as “Crypto Valley.”","When it comes to adoption, skepticism about Facebook’s data gathering has created a backlash. Facebook has spoken multiple times about the company having no direct guidance on the usage of Libra, and has promised it would not gather transaction data.","Central banks in Europe and Asia have also spoken against Libra, suggesting it may lead to the formation of a grey economy and reduce financial transparency. So far, there has been no clarity on how funds would be transferred or exchanged for Libra tokens.","It is possible Libra may be used within the Facebook ecosystem, including within the WhatsApp chat. Libra has the potential to reach millions of unbanked in almost all world regions, but the acceptance may be a lengthy process with many more regulatory hurdles.","Technically, the Libra network will use gas to pay for transactions, building on the idea of the Ethereum network and even using the very name for the resource. Unlike TRON and EOS, the network will not be free.","Additionally, the newly appointed Technical Steering Committee will oversee how Libra develops in the future.","The council of the Libra Association appoints an independent Technical Steering Committee to govern technical development for the Libra project. Meet the members: @diogomonica @JoeLallouz @ricoflan @nickgrossman @gc3tweets https://t.co/ytQj1NJKAf","— Diem Developers (@DiemDevelopers) January 17, 2020","","The most optimistic news about Libra is that its development continues. And with crypto markets starting the year on a high note, there may be more demand for this digital asset. However, there is still no strict deadline for the launch.","Do you think Facebook will have success with its Libra cryptocurrency?

However, the court also sided with the US-based exchange on certain SEC claims regarding its wallet. As a result, the case will proceed, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing dispute.","The court’s decision stemmed from the SEC’s allegations that Coinbase facilitated transactions in crypto-asset securities without proper registration, violating Sections 5, 15(a), and 17A(b) of the Exchange Act.","The SEC contended that Coinbase acted as a marketplace, bringing together buyers and sellers of “crypto-asset securities”, while also serving as a custodian of securities through its wallet system. In this regard, the court denied the exchange’s motion to dismiss Counts I, II, and III of the complaint, affirming the SEC’s claims.","Furthermore, the court found that Coinbase’s parent company, CGI, could be held liable as a control person of Coinbase under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. It determined that CGI exercised power and control over the crypto firm, managing and directing its operations, thus denying Coinbase’s motion to dismiss Count IV.","Regarding the exchange’s Staking Program, the court agreed with the SEC’s argument that it constituted an investment contract under the Howey Test, making it subject to registration under the Securities Act. According to the ruling, the program allowed customers to stake various crypto assets, and the court found that Coinbase’s managerial efforts provided financial returns, meeting the definition of an investment contract.","As a result, the court concluded that the SEC adequately alleged the exchange’s unregistered offer and sale of securities, denying Coinbase’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.","However, the court granted Coinbase’s motion concerning the SEC’s claims concerning its Wallet application. While the SEC alleged that the crypto firm conducted brokerage activity through Wallet, the court found the factual allegations insufficient to support the inference that the exchange acted as an unregistered broker.","Finally, both parties are directed to submit a proposed case management plan by the court on or before April 19, 2024.","Commenting on the potential implications of this outcome, Edward Snowden wrote the following on his X account:","This doesn’t bother me. If the SEC keeps acting in bad faith like this, they’re going to lose so hard in court that they’ll never be able to do this to anyone ever again.

DTX, a new presale crypto, has an impressive ongoing presale, cutting-edge trading features, and the potential for substantial gains even in a volatile market. It’s, therefore, no wonder that such a strong market leader would naturally influence ETH and SHIB investors. Here’s more!","\u003e\u003e\u003e BUY DTX TOKENS HERE \u003c\u003c\u003c","May 2024 saw a strong start for the global cryptocurrency market as investors heaped on cash inflows throughout the first week. But the market has not rallied as much since the first week of May ended, with bears erasing much of the earlier gains.","Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, felt the bearish pressure and saw a price decline, shedding some of its earlier highs. From the beginning of Q2 to the second week of May 2024, Ethereum’s (ETH) price declined by 21% from $3,648 to a low of $2,881.","The lacklustre performance of Ethereum (ETH) may be due to unfavorable perceptions and several setbacks regarding Ethereum ETF approval chances in the United States. Furthermore, the ongoing decrease in ETH open interest compared to spot market activity may hinder the possibility of Ethereum’s price surpassing $3,100 by the end of May 2024.","Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been one of the best-performing meme coins in 2024. In the first week of March, Shiba Inu’s price jumped by 338.49% to a high of $0.00004534 from its starting of the year amount of $0.00001034.","Consequently, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) market cap grew from $6 billion to $21 billion in the same period. However, things have not been so rosy for Shiba Inu in Q2 of 2024 as SHIB has traded below the $0.00003 price level, erasing most of its earlier gains.","Still, things look up for SHIB. Experts predict that the Shiba Inu coin burn in the second week of May could help push the price to the $0.00003 level by the end of May 2024. Conversely, a market downturn and a shift to a bearish outlook could see Shiba Inu (SHIB) tumble to $0.000022 in the same period.","Investors are increasingly drawn to the new presale token DTX Exchange (DTX) as they seek more stable investment opportunities amidst the uncertain future of Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). One of the reasons why DTX Exchange (DTX) stands out is its strong emphasis on security and wide range of features.","In addition, DTX Exchange (DTX) offers an inclusive platform that enables anyone to quickly start trading with its high leverage of 1000x. The signup process is straightforward, and there are no KYC requirements. In addition, the platform offers a DTX Wallet for secure cryptocurrency storage and various trading options for global equities.","The platform’s attractive features, such as lower trading fees, opportunities for governance participation, and the possibility of airdrops, make it an appealing option for individuals seeking to expand their cryptocurrency portfolio. In addition, DTX provides a trading platform that combines the advantages of decentralized and centralized exchanges, offering a wide range of features.","DTX Exchange (DTX) successfully raised over $2 million in its private/seed sale and an additional $100,000 in a public presale, all within an impressive two-day timeframe. Given the current token price of $0.04, investors eagerly anticipate a significant increase of 50% to $0.06 in the next stage.","Given its cutting-edge features and strong market position, DTX is well-positioned to take advantage of the changing dynamics resulting from the ETH and SHIB movements.

Notably, MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) stock has doubled this year to an all-time high (ATH) of $1,195, surpassing the record gains of the largest cryptocurrency on the market. For context, at the end of 2014, MSTR was trading around $160.","The report notes that despite concerns that Saylor, as the controlling shareholder, may be selling at the peak, MicroStrategy’s stock’s performance has mitigated such worries among investors.","During a conference call in November, Saylor clarified that he had been paid a mere $1 salary over the past decade and was ineligible for cash bonuses. He explained that exercising the options would enable him to address certain obligations and acquire more Bitcoin for his account.","Lance Vitanza, a managing director at TD Cowen, commented that the media has perhaps emphasized the story more than investors, who acknowledge that Saylor still retains a substantial amount of MicroStrategy’s stock.","However, the premium that MicroStrategy commands over Bitcoin, particularly since the introduction of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold the cryptocurrency, has begun to raise eyebrows.","In March, Kerrisdale Capital Management LLC announced that it was shorting the stock, apprehensive that it was outpacing the surge in the digital asset’s price.","Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and a consultant for blockchain firms, questioned the rationale behind purchasing MSTR at a premium when ETFs are now available.","Campbell described MSTR as a “retail magical belief stock,” similar to Tesla TSLA, which often defies fundamentals and trades on sentiment. Campbell added that while this trend may continue for some time, it is not indefinite.","MicroStrategy reported a first-quarter loss of $53 million. Interestingly, this loss was incurred despite the surge in the value of its Bitcoin holdings.","According to the report, under current accounting rules, the company cannot recognize increases in the value of its Bitcoin holdings, including the nearly 67% jump in the recent quarter.","However, a recently passed accounting rule will require valuing digital assets at market prices, and companies have until 2025 to implement this revision. Instead of adopting the revision for the first quarter, MicroStrategy recorded a $191.6 million impairment loss related to its digital assets.","Since MicroStrategy began purchasing Bitcoin to hedge against inflation, its holdings’ value has risen to approximately $13.5 billion. During the first quarter, the company acquired an additional 25,250 Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 214,400 as of April 26.","Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a digital asset management firm, summarized Saylor’s strategy for MicroStrategy as follows: sell equity or debt and use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. As the value of Bitcoin appreciates, so does the price of MSTR stock, enabling the company to sell more stock or bonds and repeat the cycle.","Currently, BTC is trading at $61,200, down over 7% in the last seven days alone, after several failed attempts to consolidate above higher levels as selling pressure mounts.","Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"],"create_date":"2024-04-30T13:00:09-05:00","tag":"bitcoin","author":"Ronaldo Marquez"}

However, the court also sided with the US-based exchange on certain SEC claims regarding its wallet. As a result, the case will proceed, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing dispute.","The court’s decision stemmed from the SEC’s allegations that Coinbase facilitated transactions in crypto-asset securities without proper registration, violating Sections 5, 15(a), and 17A(b) of the Exchange Act.","The SEC contended that Coinbase acted as a marketplace, bringing together buyers and sellers of “crypto-asset securities”, while also serving as a custodian of securities through its wallet system. In this regard, the court denied the exchange’s motion to dismiss Counts I, II, and III of the complaint, affirming the SEC’s claims.","Furthermore, the court found that Coinbase’s parent company, CGI, could be held liable as a control person of Coinbase under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. It determined that CGI exercised power and control over the crypto firm, managing and directing its operations, thus denying Coinbase’s motion to dismiss Count IV.","Regarding the exchange’s Staking Program, the court agreed with the SEC’s argument that it constituted an investment contract under the Howey Test, making it subject to registration under the Securities Act. According to the ruling, the program allowed customers to stake various crypto assets, and the court found that Coinbase’s managerial efforts provided financial returns, meeting the definition of an investment contract.","As a result, the court concluded that the SEC adequately alleged the exchange’s unregistered offer and sale of securities, denying Coinbase’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.","However, the court granted Coinbase’s motion concerning the SEC’s claims concerning its Wallet application. While the SEC alleged that the crypto firm conducted brokerage activity through Wallet, the court found the factual allegations insufficient to support the inference that the exchange acted as an unregistered broker.","Finally, both parties are directed to submit a proposed case management plan by the court on or before April 19, 2024.","Commenting on the potential implications of this outcome, Edward Snowden wrote the following on his X account:","This doesn’t bother me. If the SEC keeps acting in bad faith like this, they’re going to lose so hard in court that they’ll never be able to do this to anyone ever again. Remember when the SEC got spanked so badly that Gensler had to approve BTC ETFs with tears in his eyes? yeah","Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"],"create_date":"2024-03-27T10:16:04-05:00","tag":"coinbase","author":"Ronaldo Marquez"}

DTX, a","title":"Ethereum and Shiba Inu Investors Pivot to DTX, Banking on Its Potential for Massive Returns | Bitcoinist.com","content":["Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are experiencing price declines, leading many investors to turn to DTX Exchange (DTX) for potential opportunities. DTX, a new presale crypto, has an impressive ongoing presale, cutting-edge trading features, and the potential for substantial gains even in a volatile market. It’s, therefore, no wonder that such a strong market leader would naturally influence ETH and SHIB investors. Here’s more!","\u003e\u003e\u003e BUY DTX TOKENS HERE \u003c\u003c\u003c","May 2024 saw a strong start for the global cryptocurrency market as investors heaped on cash inflows throughout the first week. But the market has not rallied as much since the first week of May ended, with bears erasing much of the earlier gains.","Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, felt the bearish pressure and saw a price decline, shedding some of its earlier highs. From the beginning of Q2 to the second week of May 2024, Ethereum’s (ETH) price declined by 21% from $3,648 to a low of $2,881.","The lacklustre performance of Ethereum (ETH) may be due to unfavorable perceptions and several setbacks regarding Ethereum ETF approval chances in the United States. Furthermore, the ongoing decrease in ETH open interest compared to spot market activity may hinder the possibility of Ethereum’s price surpassing $3,100 by the end of May 2024.","Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been one of the best-performing meme coins in 2024. In the first week of March, Shiba Inu’s price jumped by 338.49% to a high of $0.00004534 from its starting of the year amount of $0.00001034.","Consequently, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) market cap grew from $6 billion to $21 billion in the same period. However, things have not been so rosy for Shiba Inu in Q2 of 2024 as SHIB has traded below the $0.00003 price level, erasing most of its earlier gains.","Still, things look up for SHIB. Experts predict that the Shiba Inu coin burn in the second week of May could help push the price to the $0.00003 level by the end of May 2024. Conversely, a market downturn and a shift to a bearish outlook could see Shiba Inu (SHIB) tumble to $0.000022 in the same period.","Investors are increasingly drawn to the new presale token DTX Exchange (DTX) as they seek more stable investment opportunities amidst the uncertain future of Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). One of the reasons why DTX Exchange (DTX) stands out is its strong emphasis on security and wide range of features.","In addition, DTX Exchange (DTX) offers an inclusive platform that enables anyone to quickly start trading with its high leverage of 1000x. The signup process is straightforward, and there are no KYC requirements. In addition, the platform offers a DTX Wallet for secure cryptocurrency storage and various trading options for global equities.","The platform’s attractive features, such as lower trading fees, opportunities for governance participation, and the possibility of airdrops, make it an appealing option for individuals seeking to expand their cryptocurrency portfolio. In addition, DTX provides a trading platform that combines the advantages of decentralized and centralized exchanges, offering a wide range of features.","DTX Exchange (DTX) successfully raised over $2 million in its private/seed sale and an additional $100,000 in a public presale, all within an impressive two-day timeframe. Given the current token price of $0.04, investors eagerly anticipate a significant increase of 50% to $0.06 in the next stage.","Given its cutting-edge features and strong market position, DTX is well-positioned to take advantage of the changing dynamics resulting from the ETH and SHIB movements. This makes it an excellent choice for investors looking for the best coins to invest in 2024.","Visit DTX Exchange Presale","Join The DTX Community","Disclaimer: This is a paid release.

Notably, MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) stock has doubled this year to an all-time high (ATH) of $1,195, surpassing the record gains of the largest cryptocurrency on the market. For context, at the end of 2014, MSTR was trading around $160.","The report notes that despite concerns that Saylor, as the controlling shareholder, may be selling at the peak, MicroStrategy’s stock’s performance has mitigated such worries among investors.","During a conference call in November, Saylor clarified that he had been paid a mere $1 salary over the past decade and was ineligible for cash bonuses. He explained that exercising the options would enable him to address certain obligations and acquire more Bitcoin for his account.","Lance Vitanza, a managing director at TD Cowen, commented that the media has perhaps emphasized the story more than investors, who acknowledge that Saylor still retains a substantial amount of MicroStrategy’s stock.","However, the premium that MicroStrategy commands over Bitcoin, particularly since the introduction of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold the cryptocurrency, has begun to raise eyebrows.","In March, Kerrisdale Capital Management LLC announced that it was shorting the stock, apprehensive that it was outpacing the surge in the digital asset’s price.","Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and a consultant for blockchain firms, questioned the rationale behind purchasing MSTR at a premium when ETFs are now available.","Campbell described MSTR as a “retail magical belief stock,” similar to Tesla TSLA, which often defies fundamentals and trades on sentiment. Campbell added that while this trend may continue for some time, it is not indefinite.","MicroStrategy reported a first-quarter loss of $53 million. Interestingly, this loss was incurred despite the surge in the value of its Bitcoin holdings.","According to the report, under current accounting rules, the company cannot recognize increases in the value of its Bitcoin holdings, including the nearly 67% jump in the recent quarter.","However, a recently passed accounting rule will require valuing digital assets at market prices, and companies have until 2025 to implement this revision. Instead of adopting the revision for the first quarter, MicroStrategy recorded a $191.6 million impairment loss related to its digital assets.","Since MicroStrategy began purchasing Bitcoin to hedge against inflation, its holdings’ value has risen to approximately $13.5 billion. During the first quarter, the company acquired an additional 25,250 Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 214,400 as of April 26.","Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a digital asset management firm, summarized Saylor’s strategy for MicroStrategy as follows: sell equity or debt and use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. As the value of Bitcoin appreciates, so does the price of MSTR stock, enabling the company to sell more stock or bonds and repeat the cycle.","Currently, BTC is trading at $61,200, down over 7% in the last seven days alone, after several failed attempts to consolidate above higher levels as selling pressure mounts.","Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"],"create_date":"2024-04-30T13:00:09-05:00","tag":"bitcoin","author":"Ronaldo Marquez"}

However, US law required him to disclose and pay taxes on capital gains from his global assets, including the Bitcoin he held.","The indictment further alleges that Ver provided false or misleading information to his legal representatives and appraisers, understating the value of his companies and Bitcoin holdings. Consequently, he is accused of filing false tax returns that significantly undervalued his assets, evading substantial tax obligations.","Prosecutors claim that Roger Ver’s actions caused a loss of at least $48 million to the IRS. Despite no longer being a US citizen, he was legally obligated to report and pay taxes on certain distributions, including dividends, from his US-based companies.","However, Ver allegedly concealed his receipt and sale of Bitcoin held by his businesses, failing to report the associated gains and pay the required taxes.","Roger Ver, the “Bitcoin Jesus,” has been taken into custody in Spain, where he was arrested on the above charges. As a result, the US is seeking his extradition to stand trial.","Featured image from Bloomberg, chart from TradingView.com"],"create_date":"2024-04-30T14:18:17-05:00","tag":"bitcoin","author":"Ronaldo Marquez"}
