While some analysts predict a significant price jump this weekend, others remain cautious due to the coin’s recent struggles and the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC.","XRP has been stuck in low gear, failing to break past the $0.54 resistance level for weeks. This sluggishness extends to the broader timeframes, with the coin experiencing a decline in the past month, week, and even the last 24 hours.","At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5185, down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, but managed a measly 0.4% uptick in the last week, data from Coingecko shows.","Coincodex, a prominent crypto prediction platform, stands out from the crowd with a bullish forecast. They predict a substantial price increase for XRP, with the coin potentially reaching $0.648 by Tuesday, May 21st. This would represent a jump of over 32% from its current price.","However, even Coincodex acknowledges the potential for a different scenario. The report mentions the possibility of consolidation around $0.4952 or even a price drop if profit-taking intensifies.","Many experts believe the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC is a significant factor behind XRP’s underperformance. The SEC alleges that XRP is a security, while Ripple argues it’s a currency. This legal battle has cast a shadow over the cryptocurrency, leading to investor hesitation.","There is a glimmer of hope, however. The article reports that the lawsuit is nearing its conclusion, with a final judgment expected from Judge Analisa Torres this year. A definitive resolution, especially if it favors Ripple, could pave the way for a significant price increase in the future. Some analysts, as the report mentions, even predict XRP could surge to $47 during the next bull run.","The future of XRP remains uncertain. Coincodex’s prediction offers a ray of optimism for a near-term price jump. However, the recent price slump, ongoing legal battle, and cautious investor sentiment paint a more complex picture.","The resolution of the SEC lawsuit could be a turning point for XRP. If Ripple prevails, it could remove a major obstacle to wider adoption and institutional investment. This, combined with a potential bull run in the broader cryptocurrency market, could propel XRP to new heights.","However, even a favorable outcome wouldn’t guarantee smooth sailing. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and XRP faces competition from other established players.","Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"],"create_date":"2024-05-16T08:07:41+00:00","tag":"","author":"Christian Encila"}

This is the","title":"ETH ETF is Old News; here\u0027s The New AI Crypto Driving Headlines During Wormhole and FTT Dump | NewsBTC","content":["Investors can only wait so long for innovative promises to the crypto market riled with speculation before they seek alternative investments. This is the case with the ETH ETF, which has had a lot of anticipation and activities around it without anything substantial to show. Some investors have been seen discussing AI crypto investments, with Algotech (ALGT) being a popular mention. Let’s consider why this innovative DeFi platform is making the headlines amidst the dump of tokens like Wormhole and FTT.","","Expectations have risen high for an ETH ETF, especially after the approval of Bitcoin ETF. Exchange-traded funds (ETF) allow a wider investor class to invest in assets without the hassle of holding the real assets or experiencing the volatility firsthand. Some regions have approved similar ETFs, but the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to take a clear stand or greenlight a spot ETH ETF. This cloud of regulatory uncertainty has doused the interest of many investors, shifting them to look for alternative investments with strong prospects, low entry, and high yield potential.","Wormhole is a top interoperability platform that enables multichain applications and large-scale bridging. It has so far secured the trust and partnership of top platforms like Uniswap and Circle, processing over $40 billion through $1 billion+ cross-chain messages. However, the month of May hasn’t been entirely favorable for Wormhole’s token, W, as it saw a decline from $0.77 to a low of $0.51 and is now trying to push upward with a current price of $0.54 as of writing.","FTT is the native token of FTX Exchange, a major player in the crypto derivatives market. In the last 7 days, FTT has seen a decline of 30%. It rose to a high of $2.29 on May 8 before dropping to $1.60. FTT currently trades at $1.73 at the time of writing. Investors are still looking to ascertain if it was just a normal reaction to the global market reversal or deeper underlying factors that could cause worry.","The recent surge in investors’ discussion around alternative investments like Algotech (ALGT) shows that a lack of ETH ETF has not completely dissuaded investors from the market. Algotech holds investors down with a value proposition that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data analysis to revolutionize trading and investment in the cryptocurrency market through algorithmic trading.","Algotech is building a decentralized algorithmic trading platform for cryptocurrencies that leverages AI and ML to offer more sophisticated trading strategies and automation. The goal for Algotech is first to remove the access barrier to algorithmic trading, after which it now empowers traders of all experience levels with the powerful trading tools they need to navigate the crypto market more efficiently and create wealth.","Algotech is currently in its stage presale for its native token, ALGT, at $0.08. To learn more about Algotech, visit the Algotech presale website or join the Algotech community.","Algotech (ALGT) is on the rise as ETH ETF enthusiasm fades and major platforms like Wormhole’s W token and FTX’s FTT experience declines. Algotech’s presale is recording massive success and is currently trading at $0.08 in its third presale stage.","Disclaimer: This is a paid release.

These constraints are sometimes caused by the need to depend on transnational financial institutions to broker transactions.","Regulatory inconsistencies and concerns over asset validity and ownership compound this, creating significant impediments to overseas investment.","However, Web3 and blockchain technologies promise to revolutionize our ability to cope with these limits. These technologies may circumvent conventional financial intermediaries by allowing trustless transactions and delivering immutable evidence of ownership and asset authenticity.","This results in a more efficient, secure, and accessible platform for global investment possibilities. This new environment facilitates international transactions and attracts more investors.","Web3 is a term for independent technologies like blockchain and smart contracts that aim to automate and spread out different types of assets, such as real estate.","Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that tracks events openly and transparently so anyone can check it. Next is where smart contracts come in; they automate transactions, automatically executing once pre-set conditions have been met.","The technologies above change real estate transactions by eliminating traditional intermediaries, including banks and attorneys. These mediators typically ensure that all parties adhere to the provisions outlined in the agreement.","Smart contracts and blockchain technology automatically and transparently execute these agreements for all parties, verifying the legitimacy of assets and ownership assertions. Consequently, expenses and the time needed to finalize real estate transactions are diminished.","Eliminating reliance on these intermediaries is also strategically and practically advantageous. By diminishing the influence of traditional intermediaries, Web3 expands access to real estate investment opportunities for a wider demographic.","This includes individuals lacking substantial financial resources or the expertise to navigate intricate international property regulations. Due to this transparency, the real estate market is more adaptable and diverse.","MultiBank Group, a globally regulated financial platform, has been pivotal in integrating Web3 technology into the real estate industry through its subsidiary, MultiBank.io. While MultiBank Group focuses on traditional finance, MultiBank.io leverages blockchain technology to enhance security and transparency in real estate investments and in the crypto sphere.","By adhering to global financial regulations and utilizing a secure, immutable system, MultiBank.io ensures that all transactions are recorded accurately. This provides investors with a clear and lasting record of ownership.","Moreover, MultiBank.io has developed technologies to simplify cross-border transactions, which are crucial for real estate deals involving global regulations and substantial sums of money. Their use of blockchain technology addresses common issues in international bank transfers, such as the need for intermediaries, high fees, and slow processing times. This improvement in transaction speed helps investors enter foreign markets more easily while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.","Blocksquare is a blockchain tool that uses software-as-a-service (SaaS) to turn real estate assets into tokens. This method ensures that operations are legal and can be expanded as needed. It also makes property investment management scalable and flexible.","Because they created an economic system that makes their tokens more valuable, tokenomics makes sense. Important relationships in Web3 technology have also made the site more useful and open to more businesses.","Blocksquare has a $94.8 million tokenized asset holding with 107 buildings in 21 countries. Blocksquare also plans to enter the neo-brokerage market, which aligns with its aim to drive innovation and growth in the RWA market.","This is part of a bigger plan to build community networks around its projects and improve communication with local markets. Blocksquare actively participates in 11 markets and promotes real estate investment while building a feeling of community among owners and users.","Blocksquare runs its business using blockchain systems like Ethereum, The Graph, 0x, Maker, Flux, Near, Uniswap, and DAI. Thanks to its strong and diverse technology base, Blocksquare will stay at the top of the constantly growing digital real estate market.","It makes deals quick and safe and reaffirms the company’s dedication to honesty and dependable service. This is important for maintaining investors’ trust and happiness in the constantly changing real estate investment market.","Web3 and tokenization could change the world’s real estate markets by making investments easier to obtain and eliminating the need for agents to build trust. By turning real estate into digital tokens that can be transferred, this technology makes it much easier for people who are worried about money, government rules, or logistics to invest in homes abroad. This opens up opportunities for many buyers, even those who couldn’t before.","A keystone of Web3 and tokenization, blockchain technology provides increased security and openness. Because blockchain transactions are permanent and open to public inspection, traditional middlemen like banks and lawyers are no longer needed. This may discourage dishonesty and corruption and simultaneously speed up and lower the investment process’s expenses.","Historically, the real estate industry has had less liquidity and greater difficulty joining.

This is the","title":"ETH ETF is Old News; here\u0027s The New AI Crypto Driving Headlines During Wormhole and FTT Dump | NewsBTC","content":["Investors can only wait so long for innovative promises to the crypto market riled with speculation before they seek alternative investments. This is the case with the ETH ETF, which has had a lot of anticipation and activities around it without anything substantial to show. Some investors have been seen discussing AI crypto investments, with Algotech (ALGT) being a popular mention. Let’s consider why this innovative DeFi platform is making the headlines amidst the dump of tokens like Wormhole and FTT.","","Expectations have risen high for an ETH ETF, especially after the approval of Bitcoin ETF. Exchange-traded funds (ETF) allow a wider investor class to invest in assets without the hassle of holding the real assets or experiencing the volatility firsthand. Some regions have approved similar ETFs, but the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to take a clear stand or greenlight a spot ETH ETF. This cloud of regulatory uncertainty has doused the interest of many investors, shifting them to look for alternative investments with strong prospects, low entry, and high yield potential.","Wormhole is a top interoperability platform that enables multichain applications and large-scale bridging. It has so far secured the trust and partnership of top platforms like Uniswap and Circle, processing over $40 billion through $1 billion+ cross-chain messages. However, the month of May hasn’t been entirely favorable for Wormhole’s token, W, as it saw a decline from $0.77 to a low of $0.51 and is now trying to push upward with a current price of $0.54 as of writing.","FTT is the native token of FTX Exchange, a major player in the crypto derivatives market. In the last 7 days, FTT has seen a decline of 30%. It rose to a high of $2.29 on May 8 before dropping to $1.60. FTT currently trades at $1.73 at the time of writing. Investors are still looking to ascertain if it was just a normal reaction to the global market reversal or deeper underlying factors that could cause worry.","The recent surge in investors’ discussion around alternative investments like Algotech (ALGT) shows that a lack of ETH ETF has not completely dissuaded investors from the market. Algotech holds investors down with a value proposition that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data analysis to revolutionize trading and investment in the cryptocurrency market through algorithmic trading.","Algotech is building a decentralized algorithmic trading platform for cryptocurrencies that leverages AI and ML to offer more sophisticated trading strategies and automation. The goal for Algotech is first to remove the access barrier to algorithmic trading, after which it now empowers traders of all experience levels with the powerful trading tools they need to navigate the crypto market more efficiently and create wealth.","Algotech is currently in its stage presale for its native token, ALGT, at $0.08. To learn more about Algotech, visit the Algotech presale website or join the Algotech community.","Algotech (ALGT) is on the rise as ETH ETF enthusiasm fades and major platforms like Wormhole’s W token and FTX’s FTT experience declines. Algotech’s presale is recording massive success and is currently trading at $0.08 in its third presale stage.","Disclaimer: This is a paid release.

Kevin Capital, a cryptocurrency market expert and enthusiast has offered insights on DOGE’s price action, confirming an effective break out for the crypto asset, as it surpasses the $0.153 resistance level.","It is noteworthy that the crypto analyst Kevin previously predicted that for Dogecoin to move higher it needs to break above the $0.153 level and the 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 4-hour timeframe. “When it comes to Dogecoin all DOGE needs to do to have a higher chance of playing out the potential inverse head and shoulders is a break above the 4-hour 200 SMA and the $0.153 level,” he stated.","At the time, Kevin noted that DOGE has repeatedly tried to reach this moving average and has been turned down. Thus, should the crypto asset break out of and maintain this moving average, he expects an upswing to the $0.22 price level.","According to the analyst, the development has successfully manifested today, as the digital asset has surpassed the $0.153 level and the 200 moving average. Given Kevin’s prognosis, Dogecoin will have to sustain this area to see a further upsurge.","If DOGE manages to hold during any prospective backtest and thereafter, Kevin has placed his inverted head and shoulders target at $0.18 and $0.22, if it is within reach.","The post read:","Update on the Dogecoin chart. We have officially broken above the $0.153 level and the 200 SMA on the 4HR. We need to hold this area on any potential backtest and then .18 cents and the inverse head and shoulders target of $0.22 cents if right in reach.","This accomplishment coincides with a spike in the meme coin market’s favorable sentiment, which indicates increased investor trust and interest in these digital assets. With breakouts and decouplings occurring all over the place over the past few days, meme coins had an eye-catching start to the week.","Dogecoin’s recent price upswing has triggered an optimistic outlook from multiple crypto experts. Another analyst who has shared a positive prediction for the meme coin is Crypto Daily Trade Signals.","Crypto Daily Trade Signals has delved into the current support levels for DOGE and the potential price trajectory following a breakout. According to the channel, the 50-day EMA at $0.1652 is serving as a resistance level at the moment. Should DOGE break past this barrier, it could trigger the start of a bull run for the coin.","Furthermore, the channel noted that the 100-day EMA around $0.1434 is presently offering support, indicating that DOGE has a cushion against additional drops. Meanwhile, the 200-day EMA is acting as a strong long-term support level at $0.1237.","During the time of writing, Dogecoin was demonstrating an upward momentum of over 6% in the past week, trading at $0.1549. Its trading volume and market cap have both increased by over 11% and 3% respectively in the past day."],"create_date":"2024-05-16T11:55:04+00:00","tag":"","author":"Godspower Owie"}

Today, it has turned early buyers into millionaires or billionaires. What will you do if such a unique opportunity presents itself today? Will you grab the chance to become a millionaire?","Crypto industry is going through tumultuous times with established tickets like LiteCoin (LTC) and Tron (TRX) standing at an impasse. It has created room for newer coins with better technology, such as MoonBag ($MBAG), to expand on their consumer base. Investors are looking for their golden ticket to repeat what happened in 2009 with Bitcoin. MoonBag appears to be the ultimate solution to the problems investors face with most crypto coins today.","Known as silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin has seen a 33% decline during the past few days. The reason behind this humongous decline is a lack of incentives among investors. Large, single-day losses in the volatile crypto market are not unheard of; however, caution is advised when it comes to investing your capital in Litecoin.","","Image: Pexels","With new altcoins arriving in the market, contesting for considerable market share with their innovation, Litecoin needs to recover pronto to compete in the bull run.","Tron expects a strong bull season this year; however, infrastructure issues have hindered its progress. Created in 2017, Tron’s operating system provides complete ownership rights to creators. While Tron’s framework is remarkable, it focuses less on direct user engagement.","","Image: Pexels","It is the smart contracts of Tron that are driving liquidity provisions. While inorganic activity is vital for sustaining the DeFi ecosystem, these automated programmes don’t resemble settlement in the traditional sense.","While Litecoin enters bear season and Tron grapples with inorganic activity, a new coin is making waves in the cryptosphere: MoonBag coin.","","This isn’t just another coin on the block(chain); MoonBag is your ticket to the Lunar Expedition of the Century! Each MoonBag purchased is a step closer to Saturn V’s lunar mission, in the initial phase 95,000 000 MoonBags were purchased for “lift off!”. MoonBag Coin is in line for a meteoric rise with liquidity and Ethereum’s security, enabling you to tap into liquidity pools and trading opportunities.","Getting your wallet listed with MoonBag comes with its perks. You become a part of an exclusive circle that gets the coins at a reduced price than the general market, which primes you for a huge increase when the MoonBag coin goes public. Additionally, 20% of all funds accumulated via presale is segregated in a liquidity wallet by default from the beginning of the contract. It means your account will be liquid from the get-go, an offer that only some coins propose in the turbulent crypto world.","The competition for the top slot in the altcoin market is thick, with creative new coins making their mark. In the unpredictable climate of the crypto industry, when Litecoin and Tron struggle to stand on their hypothetical feet, MoonBag promises stability, security, and liquidity.","Time is of essence! When the presale event is over, MoonBag coin will be available on the open market and is projected to be at an amazing price of 0.0030. This definitely means it is the right time to grab your place in the first stage of the MoonBag coin presale!

On the development side, NEAR’s co-founder is looking way ahead, predicting that artificial intelligence will be a game-changer for DAOs.","In the past month, NEAR has surged nearly 50%, gaining strong upward momentum. Over the past year, the NEAR token has skyrocketed by over 335%, reflecting growing adoption and boosting the network’s overall growth.","Despite the recent bear market, NEAR’s price has shown resilience. Analysts predict a strong comeback, expecting NEAR to replicate its past successes and continue its upward trajectory., especially as the recent successful transmission of the first encrypted message on its X Page demonstrates the protocol’s potential for broader application.","Ethereum’s been in the news lately, and it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Ethereum’s price has been dipping down around $3,000, which might be because investors who bought in early are cashing out their profits.","On the bright side, developers are working on improving the Ethereum wallets. Of course, regulatory turmoil regarding crypto also remains a point of focus, which can also make the market jittery.","In line with losses from last month, Ethereum sellers remain dominant. The price consolidation is clear, with Ethereum moving sideways and down 6% over the past week. The trading volume is also below Ethereum’s average, sitting at just $11 billion. This inactivity suggests the market is waiting for a breakout. Whether Ethereum moves above or drops will indicate if this sideways movement is a period of distribution or accumulation.","Raboo is integrating SocialFi and artificial intelligence, by offering a fun and rewarding way for token holders to generate and share memes.","Social-fi combines social media and finance, creating platforms where users earn by engaging. It’s innovative because it rewards creativity and interaction, making social activities financially beneficial.","Raboo’s ecosystem features NFTs, merchandise, and AI-generated memes.

The meme coin niche has witnessed a strong resurgence in the past day, with the entire niche up by 7.82%. Shiba Inu has particularly done well and witnessed a strong volume of interest amidst this uptick. Interestingly, this uptick in volume for SHIB has surpassed DOGE, with on-chain data suggesting SHIB could do better in the short term.

While some analysts predict a significant price jump this weekend, others remain cautious due to the coin’s recent struggles and the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC.","XRP has been stuck in low gear, failing to break past the $0.54 resistance level for weeks. This sluggishness extends to the broader timeframes, with the coin experiencing a decline in the past month, week, and even the last 24 hours.","At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5185, down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, but managed a measly 0.4% uptick in the last week, data from Coingecko shows.","Coincodex, a prominent crypto prediction platform, stands out from the crowd with a bullish forecast. They predict a substantial price increase for XRP, with the coin potentially reaching $0.648 by Tuesday, May 21st. This would represent a jump of over 32% from its current price.","However, even Coincodex acknowledges the potential for a different scenario. The report mentions the possibility of consolidation around $0.4952 or even a price drop if profit-taking intensifies.","Many experts believe the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC is a significant factor behind XRP’s underperformance. The SEC alleges that XRP is a security, while Ripple argues it’s a currency. This legal battle has cast a shadow over the cryptocurrency, leading to investor hesitation.","There is a glimmer of hope, however. The article reports that the lawsuit is nearing its conclusion, with a final judgment expected from Judge Analisa Torres this year. A definitive resolution, especially if it favors Ripple, could pave the way for a significant price increase in the future. Some analysts, as the report mentions, even predict XRP could surge to $47 during the next bull run.","The future of XRP remains uncertain. Coincodex’s prediction offers a ray of optimism for a near-term price jump. However, the recent price slump, ongoing legal battle, and cautious investor sentiment paint a more complex picture.","The resolution of the SEC lawsuit could be a turning point for XRP. If Ripple prevails, it could remove a major obstacle to wider adoption and institutional investment. This, combined with a potential bull run in the broader cryptocurrency market, could propel XRP to new heights.","However, even a favorable outcome wouldn’t guarantee smooth sailing. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and XRP faces competition from other established players.","Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"],"create_date":"2024-05-16T08:07:41+00:00","tag":"","author":"Christian Encila"}

This recent price rally from the flagship crypto is believed to be due to several factors, including the recently released inflation data.","The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data was announced on May 15 and came in lower than expected. The CPI rose by 0.3% in April, against forecasts of 0.4%. The CPI data was also lower than those recorded in March and February, when inflation rose by 0.4%.","Therefore, the latest inflation data suggests that inflation in the US might be slowing down. This development has provided some relief for investors, as the Fed is likely to maintain a dovish stance and consider rate cuts as inflation looks to decline. Lower interest rates mean investors will be more confident investing in risk assets like Bitcoin.","Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s rally is recent reports showing that some notable institutions are heavily invested in the flagship crypto. Bitcoinist reported that the State of Wisconsin has invested almost $99 million in BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF. Hedge Fund Millenium Management is also reported to hold $1.94 billion across five different Spot Bitcoin ETF products.","This presents a bullish outlook for Bitcoin as it suggests that institutional investors are interested in the crypto token for the long term. Meanwhile, from a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin also looked primed for this rally, with crypto analyst Rekt Capital revealing that the flagship crypto was out of the post-halving “Danger Zone.”","Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also noted that Bitcoin was displaying a cup and reversal pattern on the weekly chart and added that the “breakout will be explosive and will send it to a cycle top.”","In a Telegram update, crypto trading firm QCP Capital stated that they expect this bullish momentum to take Bitcoin’s price to the previous highs of $74,000. They highlighted activity in the derivatives market and growing institutional demand as factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s rise to this price level.","They also raised the possibility of this being the resumption of the bull market, stating that “the stars seem to be aligning on this breakout with significant sovereign and institutional adoption, abating inflation and upcoming US elections.” The trading firm added, “If this is indeed the start of the bull trend again, then this move could take us past all-time highs.”","","Rekt Capital suggested that this might be the beginning of an upward trend for the flagship crypto as he revealed that the daily downtrend for Bitcoin is over.

After a hashrate surge to celebrate the block reward reduction in April, Bitcoin’s computational power has taken a nosedive, dropping 20% in recent weeks.","This unexpected decline has ignited a debate among analysts, with some sniffing out a fire sale and others urging caution.","Hashrate, a measure of the combined processing power dedicated to securing the Bitcoin network, typically climbs after a halving event as miners invest in more powerful rigs to compete for the reduced rewards.","However, this time around, the trend defied expectations. Experts like Maartunn, a pseudonymous analyst at CryptoQuant, believe this signals a potential “miner capitulation.”","Less efficient miners are now likely throwing in the towel. The halving, which cut block rewards in half, squeezed profit margins for miners using older equipment. As these miners shut down their operations, the hashrate dips.","Supporting Maartunn’s theory is a technical indicator called Hash Ribbons. This metric tracks the difference between short-term and long-term hashrate averages. When the gap widens, it suggests a decline in mining activity, potentially due to less efficient miners dropping off.","The recent hashrate plunge has triggered a spike in Hash Ribbons, historically a sign of miner capitulation that has often coincided with price lows for Bitcoin.","Further fueling the capitulation theory is a decrease in Bitcoin’s Miner Reserve. This metric tracks the amount of Bitcoin held in wallets associated with miners. A decline in the reserve suggests miners might be offloading their mined coins, potentially to cover operational costs or to exit the market altogether.","Maartunn interprets these signs as a bullish indicator. Hash Ribbons often point to opportune moments to buy, he argues. Backing his claim is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which suggests Bitcoin might be undervalued.","This metric compares the current market price to the average price at which all Bitcoins were acquired. A negative MVRV, like the one Bitcoin currently has, suggests the asset is trading below its historical cost basis, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.","However, not all analysts are convinced. Some argue that the hashrate decline could be temporary, perhaps due to factors like extreme weather events disrupting mining operations in certain regions.","Additionally, the post-halving period is typically one of adjustment for miners, and a short-term hashrate fluctuation might not necessarily signal a mass exodus.","The post-halving Bitcoin landscape is still unfolding. While the hashrate decline and other signs suggest a potential buying opportunity, particularly for long-term investors, the situation remains fluid.","Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView"],"create_date":"2024-05-16T11:55:28+00:00","tag":"","author":"Christian Encila"}

Interestingly, this uptick in volume for SHIB has surpassed DOGE, with on-chain data suggesting SHIB could do better in the short term.

According to ITB’s holding by time metric, DOGE has seen a 1.86% increase in the number of holders in the past 30 days, compared to a 0.43% increase for SHIB.

While some analysts predict a significant price jump this weekend, others remain cautious due to the coin’s recent struggles and the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC.","XRP has been stuck in low gear, failing to break past the $0.54 resistance level for weeks. This sluggishness extends to the broader timeframes, with the coin experiencing a decline in the past month, week, and even the last 24 hours.","At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5185, down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, but managed a measly 0.4% uptick in the last week, data from Coingecko shows.","Coincodex, a prominent crypto prediction platform, stands out from the crowd with a bullish forecast. They predict a substantial price increase for XRP, with the coin potentially reaching $0.648 by Tuesday, May 21st. This would represent a jump of over 32% from its current price.","However, even Coincodex acknowledges the potential for a different scenario. The report mentions the possibility of consolidation around $0.4952 or even a price drop if profit-taking intensifies.","Many experts believe the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC is a significant factor behind XRP’s underperformance. The SEC alleges that XRP is a security, while Ripple argues it’s a currency. This legal battle has cast a shadow over the cryptocurrency, leading to investor hesitation.","There is a glimmer of hope, however. The article reports that the lawsuit is nearing its conclusion, with a final judgment expected from Judge Analisa Torres this year. A definitive resolution, especially if it favors Ripple, could pave the way for a significant price increase in the future. Some analysts, as the report mentions, even predict XRP could surge to $47 during the next bull run.","The future of XRP remains uncertain. Coincodex’s prediction offers a ray of optimism for a near-term price jump. However, the recent price slump, ongoing legal battle, and cautious investor sentiment paint a more complex picture.","The resolution of the SEC lawsuit could be a turning point for XRP. If Ripple prevails, it could remove a major obstacle to wider adoption and institutional investment. This, combined with a potential bull run in the broader cryptocurrency market, could propel XRP to new heights.","However, even a favorable outcome wouldn’t guarantee smooth sailing. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and XRP faces competition from other established players.","Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"],"create_date":"2024-05-16T08:07:41+00:00","tag":"","author":"Christian Encila"}

This is the","title":"ETH ETF is Old News; here\u0027s The New AI Crypto Driving Headlines During Wormhole and FTT Dump | NewsBTC","content":["Investors can only wait so long for innovative promises to the crypto market riled with speculation before they seek alternative investments. This is the case with the ETH ETF, which has had a lot of anticipation and activities around it without anything substantial to show. Some investors have been seen discussing AI crypto investments, with Algotech (ALGT) being a popular mention. Let’s consider why this innovative DeFi platform is making the headlines amidst the dump of tokens like Wormhole and FTT.","","Expectations have risen high for an ETH ETF, especially after the approval of Bitcoin ETF. Exchange-traded funds (ETF) allow a wider investor class to invest in assets without the hassle of holding the real assets or experiencing the volatility firsthand. Some regions have approved similar ETFs, but the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to take a clear stand or greenlight a spot ETH ETF. This cloud of regulatory uncertainty has doused the interest of many investors, shifting them to look for alternative investments with strong prospects, low entry, and high yield potential.","Wormhole is a top interoperability platform that enables multichain applications and large-scale bridging. It has so far secured the trust and partnership of top platforms like Uniswap and Circle, processing over $40 billion through $1 billion+ cross-chain messages. However, the month of May hasn’t been entirely favorable for Wormhole’s token, W, as it saw a decline from $0.77 to a low of $0.51 and is now trying to push upward with a current price of $0.54 as of writing.","FTT is the native token of FTX Exchange, a major player in the crypto derivatives market. In the last 7 days, FTT has seen a decline of 30%. It rose to a high of $2.29 on May 8 before dropping to $1.60. FTT currently trades at $1.73 at the time of writing. Investors are still looking to ascertain if it was just a normal reaction to the global market reversal or deeper underlying factors that could cause worry.","The recent surge in investors’ discussion around alternative investments like Algotech (ALGT) shows that a lack of ETH ETF has not completely dissuaded investors from the market. Algotech holds investors down with a value proposition that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data analysis to revolutionize trading and investment in the cryptocurrency market through algorithmic trading.","Algotech is building a decentralized algorithmic trading platform for cryptocurrencies that leverages AI and ML to offer more sophisticated trading strategies and automation. The goal for Algotech is first to remove the access barrier to algorithmic trading, after which it now empowers traders of all experience levels with the powerful trading tools they need to navigate the crypto market more efficiently and create wealth.","Algotech is currently in its stage presale for its native token, ALGT, at $0.08. To learn more about Algotech, visit the Algotech presale website or join the Algotech community.","Algotech (ALGT) is on the rise as ETH ETF enthusiasm fades and major platforms like Wormhole’s W token and FTX’s FTT experience declines. Algotech’s presale is recording massive success and is currently trading at $0.08 in its third presale stage.","Disclaimer: This is a paid release.

Priced at just $0.0042, the RABT token is tipped to surge 100x in 2024. Analysts also expect a 233% growth during the presale period.","Could Raboo be the next AI crypto king?","NEAR Protocol is making waves and rapidly climbing the market cap rankings. Its innovative features and cutting-edge technology are drawing in traders and crypto enthusiasts daily. On the development side, NEAR’s co-founder is looking way ahead, predicting that artificial intelligence will be a game-changer for DAOs.","In the past month, NEAR has surged nearly 50%, gaining strong upward momentum. Over the past year, the NEAR token has skyrocketed by over 335%, reflecting growing adoption and boosting the network’s overall growth.","Despite the recent bear market, NEAR’s price has shown resilience. Analysts predict a strong comeback, expecting NEAR to replicate its past successes and continue its upward trajectory., especially as the recent successful transmission of the first encrypted message on its X Page demonstrates the protocol’s potential for broader application.","Ethereum’s been in the news lately, and it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Ethereum’s price has been dipping down around $3,000, which might be because investors who bought in early are cashing out their profits.","On the bright side, developers are working on improving the Ethereum wallets. Of course, regulatory turmoil regarding crypto also remains a point of focus, which can also make the market jittery.","In line with losses from last month, Ethereum sellers remain dominant. The price consolidation is clear, with Ethereum moving sideways and down 6% over the past week. The trading volume is also below Ethereum’s average, sitting at just $11 billion. This inactivity suggests the market is waiting for a breakout. Whether Ethereum moves above or drops will indicate if this sideways movement is a period of distribution or accumulation.","Raboo is integrating SocialFi and artificial intelligence, by offering a fun and rewarding way for token holders to generate and share memes.","Social-fi combines social media and finance, creating platforms where users earn by engaging. It’s innovative because it rewards creativity and interaction, making social activities financially beneficial.","Raboo’s ecosystem features NFTs, merchandise, and AI-generated memes. This creates a dynamic playground where users can express themselves and engage with others. It’s a community-driven environment that celebrates digital creativity.","Raboo’s token, RABT, is designed to drive the $62 billion meme market. A future crypto burn event will reduce token supply, potentially increasing value. The smart contract has been audited by SOLIDProof, ensuring its security.","Raboo is selling out rapidly, making it an excellent limited-time opportunity. With NEAR Protocol soaring and ETH price falling, the AI crypto market is buzzing. Don’t miss out—join the Raboo presale and potentially gain significant returns.","You can participate in the Raboo presale here.","Telegram: https://t.me/RabootokenPortal","Twitter: https://twitter.com/Raboo_Official","",""],"create_date":"2024-05-16T07:28:34+00:00","tag":"","author":"NewsBTC"}

After a hashrate surge to celebrate the block reward reduction in April, Bitcoin’s computational power has taken a nosedive, dropping 20% in recent weeks.","This unexpected decline has ignited a debate among analysts, with some sniffing out a fire sale and others urging caution.","Hashrate, a measure of the combined processing power dedicated to securing the Bitcoin network, typically climbs after a halving event as miners invest in more powerful rigs to compete for the reduced rewards.","However, this time around, the trend defied expectations. Experts like Maartunn, a pseudonymous analyst at CryptoQuant, believe this signals a potential “miner capitulation.”","Less efficient miners are now likely throwing in the towel. The halving, which cut block rewards in half, squeezed profit margins for miners using older equipment. As these miners shut down their operations, the hashrate dips.","Supporting Maartunn’s theory is a technical indicator called Hash Ribbons. This metric tracks the difference between short-term and long-term hashrate averages. When the gap widens, it suggests a decline in mining activity, potentially due to less efficient miners dropping off.","The recent hashrate plunge has triggered a spike in Hash Ribbons, historically a sign of miner capitulation that has often coincided with price lows for Bitcoin.","Further fueling the capitulation theory is a decrease in Bitcoin’s Miner Reserve. This metric tracks the amount of Bitcoin held in wallets associated with miners. A decline in the reserve suggests miners might be offloading their mined coins, potentially to cover operational costs or to exit the market altogether.","Maartunn interprets these signs as a bullish indicator. Hash Ribbons often point to opportune moments to buy, he argues. Backing his claim is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which suggests Bitcoin might be undervalued.","This metric compares the current market price to the average price at which all Bitcoins were acquired. A negative MVRV, like the one Bitcoin currently has, suggests the asset is trading below its historical cost basis, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.","However, not all analysts are convinced. Some argue that the hashrate decline could be temporary, perhaps due to factors like extreme weather events disrupting mining operations in certain regions.","Additionally, the post-halving period is typically one of adjustment for miners, and a short-term hashrate fluctuation might not necessarily signal a mass exodus.","The post-halving Bitcoin landscape is still unfolding. While the hashrate decline and other signs suggest a potential buying opportunity, particularly for long-term investors, the situation remains fluid.","Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView"],"create_date":"2024-05-16T11:55:28+00:00","tag":"","author":"Christian Encila"}

When the gap widens, it suggests a decline in mining activity, potentially due to less efficient miners dropping off.","The recent hashrate plunge has triggered a spike in Hash Ribbons, historically a sign of miner capitulation that has often coincided with price lows for Bitcoin.","Further fueling the capitulation theory is a decrease in Bitcoin’s Miner Reserve. This metric tracks the amount of Bitcoin held in wallets associated with miners. A decline in the reserve suggests miners might be offloading their mined coins, potentially to cover operational costs or to exit the market altogether.","Maartunn interprets these signs as a bullish indicator. Hash Ribbons often point to opportune moments to buy, he argues. Backing his claim is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which suggests Bitcoin might be undervalued.","This metric compares the current market price to the average price at which all Bitcoins were acquired. A negative MVRV, like the one Bitcoin currently has, suggests the asset is trading below its historical cost basis, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.","However, not all analysts are convinced. Some argue that the hashrate decline could be temporary, perhaps due to factors like extreme weather events disrupting mining operations in certain regions.","Additionally, the post-halving period is typically one of adjustment for miners, and a short-term hashrate fluctuation might not necessarily signal a mass exodus.","The post-halving Bitcoin landscape is still unfolding. While the hashrate decline and other signs suggest a potential buying opportunity, particularly for long-term investors, the situation remains fluid.","Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView"],"create_date":"2024-05-16T11:55:28+00:00","tag":"","author":"Christian Encila"}

However, KangaMoon is making waves in the meme coin space with its creative and practical strategy. The trajectories of these coins may be different, but they continue to capture investors’ attention. Let’s find out why.","Important support and resistance levels are shown on the Avalanche price chart, which displays the price activity of Avalanche over a range of periods. The Avalanche price right now is about $32. A drop below the $30 region would set off a chain reaction of liquidations and further decrease prices. Critical support is found at $30.74, which is close to the $30 mark and in line with the 0.618 Fibonacci line.","Keeping an eye on these levels might assist traders and investors in projecting future price fluctuations. Three important resistance levels are $39.78, $34.06 (100 EMA), and $33.26 (200 EMA). The 4-hour timeframe’s EMA 100 and 200 are noteworthy because they may serve as trendline resistance during a negative trend.","Render has been seeing some positive trends lately. Remarkably, Render disclosed that a recent Apple keynote highlighted its Octane X project. Customers of Apple devices can now fully utilize M4’s substantial rendering power thanks to this release.","This crypto could see a surge in value as a result of the positive Render news. Meanwhile, the Render market cap has decreased by 10% to reach $3.90 billion despite a 440% increase in the Render price within the last year. In addition, the Render token is flashing green on over 26 technical indicators. Thus, before the conclusion of Q2 of 2024, market analysts estimate a spike to $13.45.","KangaMoon (KANG) is making waves in the meme coin space with its creative and practical strategy. Unlike meaningless traditional memecoins, KANG serves as the in-game currency for the upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. One of the unique advantages experienced by KANG holders is access to weekly, monthly, and quarterly challenges that grant extra tokens and in-game items.","When these items are traded on the KangaMoon market, the meme coin’s actual value increases. KangaMoon is now 400% over its starting price, or $0.025, and at the bonus stage of its presale. But experts anticipate a massive jump in value with the offering of KangaMoon by a Tier-1 Centralized Exchange (CEX) in the second quarter of 2024.","","🌟 Upcoming New Listing 🌟","🤩 #BitMart will list #KANG @Kangamoon_P2E soon!","Keep an eye on our socials for further announcements.","Share in the comments what you like about this project👇 pic.twitter.com/YvT39QoKba","— BitMart (@BitMartExchange) May 15, 2024","Those who want to buy KangaMoon can benefit from purchasing KangaMoon and spreading the word about it on social media, users may start earning tokens and winning prizes right now.
