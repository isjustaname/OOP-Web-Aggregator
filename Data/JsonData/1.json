The challenge with LLMs like ChatGPT is maintaining generation quality during extended interactions, constrained by the input length and GPU memory limits. LLMs struggle with inputs longer than their training sequence and can collapse if the input exceeds the attention window, limited by GPU memory","The introduction of StreamingLLM by Xiao et al. published with title \"EFFICIENT STREAMING LANGUAGE MODELS WITH ATTENTION SINKS\" from MIT has been a breakthrough. This method allows streaming text inputs of over 4 million tokens in multi-round conversations without compromising on inference speed and generation quality, achieving a remarkable 22.2 times speedup compared to traditional methods.

This breakthrough technology utilizes a blend of electroencephalography (EEG), brain-computer interfaces, and large language models to decode brain activity, representing a significant leap forward in brain-to-text communication. This breakthrough is reflective of the advances documented in the research paper \"BRAIN DECODING: TOWARD REAL-TIME RECONSTRUCTION OF VISUAL PERCEPTION\" by Yohann Benchetrit, Hubert Banville, and Jean-Remi King.","DeWave simplifies the process of translating thoughts to text, distinguishing itself from other technologies in this space. Users need only to wear an EEG headset and activate their thoughts to enable the translation. This method is notably less invasive compared to other technologies, such as Elon Musk\u0027s Neuralink, which requires surgical implantation of a brain-machine interface chip. DeWave’s approach offers a more accessible and non-invasive solution, making it a potentially revolutionary tool for those with speech impairments due to conditions like stroke, brain thrombosis, or deafness. Currently, DeWave achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 40% in its translations.","This technology\u0027s significance was recognized globally when it was selected as an important paper by the NeurIPS conference, one of the most prestigious gatherings in the machine learning community. DeWave\u0027s approach is somewhat similar to a project by Meta, which used MEG (magnetoencephalography) to reconstruct human brain imaging processes. Both initiatives share the common goal of capturing and decoding faint brain activity through EEG and MEG tools. After acquiring the raw brain data, researchers employ large language models to decode it, extracting crucial visual and textual information. This process is fundamental in translating and reconstructing human thoughts and mental images.","The core technology of DeWave involves transforming continuous brainwave signals into discrete codes. This is achieved using a structure known as a vector quantized variational encoder, which converts received brainwave signals into a series of vectorized feature representations. These representations are then turned into a series of discrete codes, each corresponding to a discrete word vector in a codebook. The codebook functions like a dictionary, containing a limited number of discrete word vectors. The most matching discrete word vector from the codebook is used to obtain the corresponding discrete code. Once a series of discrete codes is obtained, they can be processed like language word vectors and inputted into a pre-trained large language model to generate the translated text content.","Despite its innovative approach and potential applications, DeWave is not without its challenges. The model\u0027s reliance on pre-trained language models like BART limits its performance to the quality and capabilities of these models. If the pre-trained language model lacks accuracy or a broad understanding of language, it could affect the translation performance of the DeWave method. Additionally, the DeWave method\u0027s training process requires the use of parallel brainwave and text pair data for supervised learning. The acquisition of large-scale parallel data can be difficult or costly for certain tasks, which might limit the performance of the DeWave method. Another limitation is the model\u0027s dependence on labeled data. Despite claims of being able to translate brainwaves to text without labels, such as eye-tracking, DeWave still relies on a label-based alignment process. It uses event markers to segment brainwaves into word-level features, which could lead to inaccuracies in translation and segmentation in the absence of labels.","In conclusion, DeWave represents a significant step forward in the field of AI and neuroscience. By enabling the translation of human thoughts into text, it opens up new possibilities for communication, especially for those with speech impairments. However, like any pioneering technology, it faces challenges and limitations that will need to be addressed in future developments. As research and technology continue to advance, DeWave has the potential to become an even more effective tool for bridging the gap between human thought and communication."],"create_date":"2024-01-05T07:52:10.1920000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}

Despite remarkable advancements in similar domains, such as ChatGPT for text and Midjourney for images, video generation models often struggle with temporal consistency and natural dynamics. Addressing this challenge, researchers from S-Lab at Nanyang Technological University have developed FreeInit, a pioneering model designed to bridge the gap between training and inference phases of video diffusion models, thereby significantly enhancing video quality.","FreeInit operates by adjusting the noise initialization process, a crucial step in video generation. Conventional models use Gaussian noise in both the training and inference stages. However, this method results in videos lacking temporal consistency due to the uneven frequency distribution of initial noise. FreeInit innovatively addresses this issue by iteratively refining the spatial-temporal low-frequency components of the initial noise. This method does not require additional training or learnable parameters, seamlessly integrating into existing video diffusion models during inference.","The core technique of FreeInit lies in reinitializing noise to narrow the training-inference gap. It starts with independent Gaussian noise, which undergoes a denoising process to yield a clean video latent. Following this, the generated video latent is subjected to forward diffusion, resulting in noisy latents with improved temporal consistency. These noisy latents are then combined with high-frequency components of random Gaussian noise to create reinitialized noise, which serves as the starting point for new sampling iterations. This process significantly enhances the temporal consistency and visual appearance of the generated videos.","Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the efficacy of FreeInit, applying it to various text-to-video models like AnimateDiff, ModelScope, and VideoCrafter. The results were remarkable, showing improvements in temporal consistency metrics by 2.92 to 8.62. The qualitative and quantitative improvements were evident across various text prompts, demonstrating FreeInit\u0027s versatility and effectiveness in enhancing video generation models.","The researchers have made FreeInit openly available, encouraging its widespread use and further development. The integration of FreeInit into current video generation models holds promise for significantly advancing the field of video generation, bridging a crucial gap that has long been a challenge in this domain."],"create_date":"2024-01-06T11:49:54.8390000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}

The implications of this technology stretch far and wide, potentially impacting robotics, automated systems, and AI-based strategic planning.","UniPi’s approach to policy generation provides several advantages, including combinatorial generalization, where the AI can rearrange objects into new, unseen combinations based on language descriptions. This is a significant leap forward in multi-task learning and long-horizon planning, enabling the AI to learn from a variety of tasks and generalize its knowledge to new ones without the need for additional fine-tuning.","One of the key components of UniPi\u0027s success is its use of pretrained language embeddings, which, when combined with the plethora of videos available on the internet, allows for an unprecedented transfer of knowledge. This process facilitates the prediction of highly realistic video plans, a crucial step toward the practical application of AI agents in real-world scenarios.","The UniPi model has been rigorously tested in environments that require a high degree of combinatorial generalization and adaptability. In simulated environments, UniPi demonstrated its capability to understand and execute complex tasks specified by textual descriptions, such as arranging blocks in specific patterns or manipulating objects to achieve a goal. These tasks, often challenging for traditional AI models, highlight UniPi\u0027s potential to navigate and manipulate the physical world with a level of proficiency previously unattained.","Moreover, the researchers’ approach to learning generalist agents has direct implications for real-world transfer.

The key objectives of this legislative proposal are the following:","to extend the scope of the automatic exchange of information under DAC to information that will have to be reported by crypto-asset service providers on transactions (transfer or exchange) of crypto-assets and e-money. Expanding administrative cooperation to this new area is aimed at helping member states address the challenges posed by the digitalization of the economy. The provisions of DAC 8 on due diligence procedures, reporting requirements, and other rules applicable to reporting crypto-asset service providers will reflect the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and a set of amendments to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which were prepared by the OECD (Overseas Economic and Cooperation Development ) under the mandate of the G20. The G20 endorsed the CARF and the amendments to CRS, both of which it considers to be integral additions to the global standards for the automatic exchange of information to extend the scope of the current rules on the exchange of tax-relevant information by including provisions on the exchange of advance cross-border rulings concerning high-net-worth individuals, as well as provisions on automatic exchange of information on non- custodial dividends and similar revenues, to reduce the risks of tax evasion, tax avoidance, and tax frauds as the current provisions of DAC do not cover this type of income, to amend a number 4 other existing provisions of DAC.","","In particular, the proposal seeks to improve the rules on reporting and communication of the Tax Identification Number (TIN) to facilitate the task of tax authorities of identifying the relevant taxpayer and correctly assessing the related taxes, and to amend DAC provisions on penalties that are to be applied by member states to persons for the failure of compliance with national legislation on reporting requirements adopted under DAC.","","During the consultation procedure, the European Parliament adopted its opinion on the directive on the 13th of September 2023 under the 16th May 2023 agreement by the council.","","The directive was adopted by the member states in the Council, unanimously. It will now be published in the Official Journal and enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication.",""],"create_date":"2023-10-19T21:35:45.2710000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}

This fear proved to be well-founded, as tax affairs did precipitate Capone\u0027s downfall.","Capone\u0027s troubles with the IRS illustrates this piece well, but with a 21st-century twist. We\u0027re not talking about ill-gotten gains made through bootleg alcohol, gambling, or protection rackets. We are talking about cryptocurrencies, and how the IRS is insisting that any income arising from crypto deals is indeed taxable. And it wants its tax dollars pronto.","","The IRS is watching you","The IRS is a government agency whose sole task is to ensure that millions of Americans pay their taxes on time and in full. Or else.","Cryptocurrencies have hitherto posed a problem for the IRS, as Bitcoin (and any other cryptocurrencies, for that matter) existed in a completely unregulated space that was, for a long time, beyond the reach of the IRS\u0027s claws. The agency did not like the fact that millions of dollars were flowing freely under their hawkish noses, and there was not a single tax dollar that could be taken for Uncle Sam.","Now, to understand the IRS\u0027 predicament, you must first know that the anonymity granted by crypto transactions enabled many to make a hefty profit without exposing any personal details. Ergo, the person or persons behind the gains could not be traced. However, anonymity and decentralization were at the heart of Bitcoin\u0027s very raison d\u0027etre.","So starting back in 2016, the IRS launched a broadside into Bitcoin\u0027s ship and blew a hole wide open in its thus far watertight blockchain compartment. The IRS asked Coinbase, one of the world\u0027s largest crypto exchanges, to hand over transaction-related data for over 14,000 customers who had engaged in crypto activity through the site. Particularly, the IRS was interested in 13,000 customers who had reportedly traded in about $20,000 worth of Bitcoin between 2013 and 2015.","The move signified the first step on the IRS part to assert dominance over Bitcoin, and begin collecting what the agency believed it was owed.","Cue to 2019, when the IRS is flexing its tax-collecting arms hard by sending thousands of warning letters to crypto owners and traders.","The IRS and the letters of doom","If you are an American taxpayer who omitted to declare any income arising from crypto deals on the side in your last few tax filings, you may have reason to worry indeed.","The IRS has dispatched around 10,000 letters to as many taxpayers who are believed may have failed to disclose crypto profits. The IRS says that the names of these people were obtained through \u0027compliance efforts\u0027 on the agency\u0027s part.","The letters come in three equally ominous flavors with a big IRS stamp on them: Letter 6173, Letter 6174 or Letter 6174-A. In order of severity, 6173 is the more lenient, and 6174-A demands immediate remedial action. Or else.","Letter 6173 provides some degree of leniency and assumes that the taxpayer may have acted in good faith due to ignorance of the tax implications surrounding cryptocurrencies. In this scenario, the IRS asks you politely that you file your correct tax returns with a good explanation, and the IRS may not pursue further action.","The other two letters bear a certain degree of urgency and will expose the recipient to a tax audit if the tax situation is not rectified in time. The deadline of August 30th is approaching fast, so any affected taxpayer is in line for a few stressful days.","The bottom line","The infamous John Doe Coinbase affair sort of negated the whole concept of decentralization and anonymity that is supposed to be at the core of the cryptocurrency ethos. With one quick smite of its legal sword, the names and addresses of about 10,000 people were disclosed to the prying and hungry eyes behind the IRS visage.","Cryptocurrencies are having a troubled upbringing. Think of them as the problem child of the financial family. Banks and tax agencies are the \u0027good\u0027 brothers, cause they live in harmony with each other and collude to inflict treachery on their problematic sibling, who was seemingly born to disrupt the traditional fiat family\u0027s status quo.

A survey that was carried out not too long ago by the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) provides light on this phenomena, particularly in relation to the impending elections in the United States in the year 2024.","From the results of a survey conducted by the CCI and published on January 2nd, it seems that the majority of people who are interested in cryptocurrencies may become an important voting group in the elections of 2024. This trend might be ascribed to the increasing significance of bitcoin in the public discussion as well as its junction with regulatory measures.","As shown by the survey, an overwhelming majority of respondents (83%) who place a high priority on cryptocurrencies express a need for transparent regulations that control digital assets. This view is reflective of a larger need for regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency business, which has often found itself in a limbo in terms of the laws that govern the legal and financial aspects of the industry.","In addition, the study indicates an intriguing phenomenon of crypto voters dividing their votes between candidates for the presidential election and those for legislative elections. The fact that these voters have a complex attitude to the issue of cryptocurrencies suggests that they may support various parties or candidates at different levels of government dependent on their position on the coin.","The results of the survey reveal that 59% of respondents are inclined to support politicians who are knowledgeable about bitcoin issues. This further emphasizes the impact that cryptocurrency has on voting behavior. Moreover, over fifty percent of people believe that the stance that a candidate takes on cryptocurrencies is a deciding element in their decision regarding who they would vote for in the presidential election of 2024.","The results are noteworthy when considered in the light of the close contests that are anticipated to take place in the next elections. It is possible that voters who are focused on cryptocurrency might play a particularly important role in shifting the result in areas that are tightly fought.","It is interesting to note that the study also underlines the fact that while 89% of respondents had a positive opinion of bitcoin, their political inclinations differ, with 51% backing one presidential candidate over another.","This rising tendency is indicative of a bigger storyline in which the candidates\u0027 awareness of cryptocurrency-related issues and their positions on those policies might play a significant influence in determining whether or not they are successful in the election. Because of the fact that the cryptocurrency business is continuing to develop and attract the attention of the general public, it is expected that its influence on political processes and results will expand.

This intersection, often likened to the coming together of two powerful forces, holds the promise of revolutionizing how we approach complex problems in computing and data analysis, according to Nature.","Exploring the Potential","Quantum machine learning is a concept that involves the application of quantum algorithms to improve upon traditional machine learning techniques. Machine learning, a subset of AI, is focused on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. The incorporation of quantum computing into this domain aims to leverage the unique properties of quantum bits (qubits), such as superposition and entanglement, to process and analyze data in ways that classical computers cannot.","Companies like Google and IBM, along with startups such as Rigetti and IonQ, are actively researching the potential applications of quantum machine learning. The European particle physics laboratory, CERN, is also exploring this field, particularly in using quantum computing to enhance classical machine-learning models for analyzing data from experiments like the Large Hadron Collider.","Challenges and Skepticism","Despite the excitement, the field of quantum machine learning is still in its nascent stages, and there are significant challenges to overcome. One of the main hurdles is the current state of quantum computing technology itself. Quantum computers capable of performing complex tasks at scale are yet to be realized. Additionally, integrating classical data with quantum computing processes poses its own set of challenges.","Moreover, the question remains whether quantum machine learning can actually offer a substantial advantage over classical methods. While theory suggests that quantum computers could significantly speed up calculations for specific tasks, evidence for such an advantage in machine learning is still lacking. Skepticism persists, with some researchers like Ewin Tang challenging the notion of a significant quantum speed-up in machine learning by developing classical algorithms that can compete with their quantum counterparts.","The Future of Quantum Machine Learning","Despite these challenges, there is optimism about the potential of quantum machine learning. Researchers are beginning to focus on applying quantum algorithms to phenomena that are inherently quantum in nature. This approach could potentially reveal patterns in data that classical algorithms might miss.","Innovations in quantum sensing, which involves measuring quantum phenomena using purely quantum instruments, are also opening new avenues for quantum machine learning. This technique allows for the direct use of quantum data in machine learning algorithms, potentially bypassing the limitations of translating classical data into a quantum format.","Conclusion","The journey of integrating AI with quantum computing is still at a preliminary stage, with many theoretical and practical challenges to overcome.

This discovery underscores similariti","title":"Google DeepMind: Subtle Adversarial Image Manipulation Influences Both AI Model and Human Perception","content":["Recent research by Google DeepMind has revealed a surprising intersection between human and machine vision, particularly in their susceptibility to adversarial images. Adversarial images are digital images subtly altered to deceive AI models, making them misclassify the image contents. For example, a vase could be misclassified as a cat by the AI.","The study published in \"Nature Communications\" titled \"Subtle adversarial image manipulations influence both human and machine perception\" conducted a series of experiments to investigate the impact of adversarial images on human perception. These experiments found that while adversarial perturbations significantly mislead machines, they can also subtly influence human perception. Notably, the effect on human decision-making was consistent with the misclassifications made by AI models, albeit not as pronounced. This discovery underlines the nuanced relationship between human and machine vision, showing that both can be influenced by minor perturbations in an image, even if the perturbation magnitudes are small and the viewing times are extended.","DeepMind\u0027s research also explored the properties of artificial neural network (ANN) models that contribute to this susceptibility. They studied two ANN architectures: convolutional networks and self-attention architectures. Convolutional networks, inspired by the primate visual system, apply static local filters across the visual field, building a hierarchical representation. In contrast, self-attention architectures, originally designed for natural language processing, use nonlocal operations for global communication across the entire image space, showing a stronger bias toward shape features than texture features. These models were found to be aligned with human perception in terms of bias direction. Interestingly, adversarial images generated by self-attention models were more likely to influence human choices than those generated by convolutional models, indicating a closer alignment with human visual perception.","The research highlights the critical role of subtle, higher-order statistics of natural images in aligning human and machine perception. Both humans and machines are sensitive to these subtle statistical structures in images. This alignment suggests a potential avenue for improving ANN models, making them more robust and less susceptible to adversarial attacks. It also points to the need for further research into the shared sensitivities between human and machine vision, which could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms and theories of the human visual system. The discovery of these shared sensitivities between humans and machines has significant implications for AI safety and security, suggesting that adversarial perturbations could be exploited in real-world settings to subtly bias human perception and decision-making.","In summary, this research presents a significant step forward in understanding the intricate relationship between human and machine perception, highlighting the similarities and differences in their responses to adversarial images. It underscores the need for ongoing research in AI safety and security, particularly in understanding and mitigating the potential impacts of adversarial attacks on both AI systems and human perception."],"create_date":"2024-01-08T08:10:42.3320000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}

Instead, it focuses on bounding box information obtained through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to incorporate spatial layout structures. This approach not only decreases processing times but also barely increases the model\u0027s size, maintaining the efficiency of the causal decoder architecture. This design decision is crucial in making DocLLM a lightweight yet effective tool for document analysis.","A key innovation in DocLLM is its disentangled spatial attention mechanism, which alters the classical transformers\u0027 attention mechanism into a set of disentangled matrices. This mechanism allows the model to effectively process and align text with its corresponding spatial layout, enhancing its ability to understand and interpret documents with irregular layouts and heterogeneous content.","For pre-training, DocLLM employs an infilling objective, focusing on learning to infill text segments. This method is especially adept at handling documents with disjointed text segments and irregular layouts, which are common in real-world business documents. The pre-trained knowledge of DocLLM is then fine-tuned using instruction data from various datasets to cater to different document intelligence tasks, such as information extraction, question answering, classification, and more.","DocLLM has demonstrated exceptional performance in evaluations, outperforming state-of-the-art models in 14 out of 16 known datasets. It has also shown robust generalization capabilities, performing well on 4 out of 5 previously unseen datasets. These results highlight DocLLM\u0027s potential in various document intelligence tasks, making it a promising tool for businesses and enterprises.

Recently, a research paper titled \u0027Can AI Be as Creative as Humans?\u0027 delved deeply into the exploration of creativity in both humans and artificial intelligence. Historically, creativity has been the backbone of innovation and societal progress. However, with the advent of AI, the boundaries of creativity are being redefined. The research paper \"Can AI Be as Creative as Humans?\" by a team of experts from prestigious institutions provides a pivotal exploration of this topic.","The paper underscores AI\u0027s transformative role in both practical and creative domains. Notably, AI has shown proficiency in solving complex problems, such as drug and protein synthesis, as highlighted by Jumper et al. (2021). But more intriguingly, AI has made strides in artistic pursuits, from composing poetry to crafting narratives, challenging the notion that creativity is an exclusively human domain.","This shift raises fundamental questions about the nature of creativity and AI\u0027s role in it. Can AI truly be creative, or is it merely mimicking patterns it has learned? To address this, we must consider AI\u0027s current capabilities and limitations. AI systems, especially advanced generative models, have demonstrated the ability to generate novel ideas and concepts. For instance, AI-generated art has gained recognition, with algorithms creating pieces that have been sold in prestigious galleries.","However, creativity is not just about generating novel ideas but also about understanding and connecting with human emotions and experiences. This aspect of creativity, often intertwined with human experiences and subjectivity, poses a challenge for AI. While AI can replicate patterns and styles, its ability to genuinely understand and evoke human emotions is still a subject of debate.","Looking at the broader implications, the integration of AI in creative processes could lead to a new era of innovation. For industries like advertising, entertainment, and design, AI\u0027s ability to generate novel ideas rapidly can be a game-changer. It could also democratize creativity, enabling individuals without traditional artistic skills to express themselves creatively through AI tools.","However, this also brings ethical considerations. As AI becomes more prevalent in creative fields, questions about authorship, originality, and the value of human creativity emerge. The balance between human creativity and AI assistance needs careful consideration to ensure that AI augments rather than replaces human ingenuity.","In conclusion, while AI has made significant strides in creative domains, matching the depth and breadth of human creativity remains a complex challenge. The future of AI in creativity is not about replacing human ingenuity but about collaborating and enhancing our creative capabilities, ensuring that AI serves as a tool for expanding, not limiting, human creativity."],"create_date":"2024-01-09T15:20:47.1760000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}

The paper analyzes the impact of technological pro","title":"Scenarios for the Transition to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)","content":["The transition to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has been a topic of great interest and speculation in recent years. Many researchers and industry leaders believe that AGI, which refers to AI systems that can perform all tasks at human levels, may soon become a reality. In a working paper titled \"Scenarios for the Transition to AGI,\" economists Anton Korinek and Donghyun Suh delve into the economic implications of AGI development.","The paper starts by examining the relationship between technological progress, output, and wages. The authors propose a framework that decomposes human work into atomistic tasks with varying levels of complexity. They argue that advances in technology enable the automation of increasingly complex tasks, potentially leading to the automation of all tasks with the advent of AGI.","One crucial aspect analyzed in the paper is the race between automation and capital accumulation. If automation progresses slowly enough, there will always be enough work for humans, and wages may continue to rise. However, if the complexity of tasks that humans can perform is bounded and full automation is achieved, wages may collapse. The authors also consider the possibility of declines in wages before full automation occurs if large-scale automation outpaces capital accumulation, leading to an oversupply of labor.","The research suggests that the automation of productivity growth can result in broad-based gains in the returns to all factors of production. On the other hand, bottlenecks to growth caused by scarce, irreproducible factors may exacerbate the decline in wages. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding the distribution of tasks in complexity space and its impact on economic outcomes.","While the paper provides valuable insights into the potential consequences of AGI development, it also acknowledges the uncertainties surrounding the transition. The authors highlight that the distribution of tasks in complexity space plays a crucial role in determining the economic outcomes. They consider both unbounded and bounded distributions, with the latter reflecting the finite computational capabilities of the human brain.","Overall, the research by Korinek and Suh contributes to the ongoing discussion about the future of work in the age of AI and automation. By analyzing different scenarios for the transition to AGI, the paper sheds light on the possible effects on output, wages, and human welfare. It serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders seeking to understand the economic implications of AGI development."],"create_date":"2024-04-09T13:02:29.3380000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}

While boosting productivity and ","title":"Generative AI in the UK Public Sector: A Comprehensive Analysis","content":["The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into the UK public sector has been significantly accelerating, reshaping how public services operate. A study, titled \"Generative AI is already widespread in the Public Sector\", conducted by the Alan Turing Institute, surveying 938 public service professionals, reveals that 45% were aware of GenAI usage within their area, with 22% actively using it. This trend is seen across various sectors, including healthcare, education, social work, and emergency services. GenAI, easily accessible and often free, stands apart from traditional, top-down technology deployment. It\u0027s driven by \u0027street-level bureaucrats\u0027 needs, indicating a significant bottom-up shift in public sector operations.","Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating new content, such as text, images, or data, based on specific inputs or prompts. These systems use advanced algorithms, often based on machine learning techniques like deep learning, to analyze patterns, structures, and relationships in large datasets. By learning from this data, GenAI can generate outputs that are novel yet realistic, aligning with the context and parameters set by the user. GenAI has a wide range of applications, from drafting emails and reports to creating educational materials and aiding in decision-making processes. Its flexibility and ease of use have made it accessible to a broad audience, including professionals in various sectors.","Crucially, GenAI operates by augmenting human capabilities, automating repetitive or time-consuming tasks, and enhancing creativity and productivity, rather than replacing human input. As seen in the public sector, its adoption can significantly impact operational efficiency and service delivery, though it also raises questions about guidelines, ethical use, and responsibility.","Healthcare, for instance, has seen predictive analytics and resource allocation systems benefiting from GenAI, while planning and development leverage spatial analysis. Despite these advancements, UK public service productivity grew only by an average of 0.2% annually between 1997 and 2019. GenAI\u0027s widespread deployment could potentially increase productivity, especially considering the high bureaucratic workload in the sector. Research suggests that GenAI can significantly impact productivity, particularly for novice and low-skilled workers.","Early 2023 statistics indicated that 8.2% of global company employees used ChatGPT, with a higher percentage in the UK. In specific sectors, the Department for Education reported various uses of GenAI by teachers. A Canadian Federal Public Service survey found 11.2% usage for work purposes, highlighting GenAI\u0027s rapid deployment in public services.","Despite the UK government\u0027s guidance on GenAI usage, there\u0027s a lack of awareness and clarity among professionals. The guidance focuses on risks like data sensitivity, bias, and misinformation, but also encourages inquisitiveness about new technologies. Sector-specific guidance follows, but the effectiveness and awareness of these remain uncertain.","The survey methodology included online data collection via Qualtrics, recruiting participants from key public sector areas. The demographics of respondents were varied, covering a wide range of ages, genders, and professional seniority. The survey focused on understanding GenAI\u0027s adoption, trust, understanding, and concerns in the public sector.","Interestingly, GenAI usage surpassed other AI forms in all surveyed professions except emergency services. University and school professionals reported the highest uptake, with lower levels in NHS, emergency services, and social care. GenAI users showed a high trust in AI technology, understanding its operation, and were optimistic about its future role in enhancing productivity. However, clarity on accountability for GenAI outputs remains low. Most respondents were not concerned about AI replacing their jobs and were optimistic about AI improving public services, though they acknowledged the UK\u0027s missed opportunities in AI utilisation.","In conclusion, GenAI is making significant inroads in the UK public sector. Its bottom-up adoption suggests enhanced personal agency in its use, meeting diverse professional needs. However, challenges like lack of clear guidelines and responsibility, and varying public attitudes towards AI, hinder its full potential. The public sector\u0027s future with GenAI hinges on balancing these aspects, possibly redefining productivity and bureaucratic efficiency."],"create_date":"2024-01-09T03:36:48.5660000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}

These modifications have a specific impact on bitcoin exchanges and custodians. This piece of legislation is a component of a larger initiative to close the tax deficit in the United States, with a particular focus on the quickly development of the digital asset market.","","Source: Twitter","One of the most important provisions of the law is the modification of Section 6050I, which extends the definition of \"cash\" to include digital assets. As a consequence of this, commencing in the year 2024, every person or company that gets more than $10,000 in digital assets as a result of their commercial or business activity will be required to submit Form 8300 reports to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The cryptocurrency industry has long been defined by its decentralized and sometimes opaque nature; this move tries to provide greater openness and supervision to the sector, which has been characterized by these characteristics.","One of the most important aspects of this piece of legislation is the mandate that requires full reporting of transactions involving digital assets that exceed $10,000. A considerable obligation is placed on cryptocurrency brokers as a result of this provision, which originates directly from the infrastructure law that was passed by both parties. They are now obligated to provide the Internal Revenue Service with detailed information on transactions of this kind. This comprises the personal information of consumers who are engaged in transactions that are more than $10,000, such as their names, addresses, and social security numbers. This information is required to be disclosed within fifteen days after the transaction.","It is clear that the government is placing a greater emphasis on the cryptocurrency market, as seen by the proposed rules that were released by the Biden administration about the implementation of this essential revenue-raising component of the 2021 infrastructure bill. The purpose of these laws is to improve compliance and decrease tax evasion within this rapidly expanding industry by mandating extra reporting for transactions using cryptocurrencies.","When seen from a more holistic viewpoint, these modifications represent a fundamental shift in the manner in which the government of the United States views the regulation of digital assets. An awareness of the growing incorporation of cryptocurrencies into conventional financial institutions is reflected in the law, which provides for the extension of regular currency transaction reporting requirements to cover digital assets. Nevertheless, these newly implemented reporting standards have not been without their share of arguments. Those who are opposed to them claim that they might place an excessive burden on cryptocurrency firms and could possibly hinder innovation within the industry. Despite this, some who support the measure believe that it is an essential step that must be taken in order to guarantee more accountability and transparency in the rapidly expanding market for digital assets."],"create_date":"2024-01-04T07:12:28.3280000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}

A prime example is the performance degradation, colloquially referred to as \u0027stupidity\u0027, in Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4. This issue has gained traction in AI discussions, particularly following the publication of \"Task Contamination: Language Models May Not Be Few-Shot Anymore,\" which sheds light on the limitations and challenges faced by current LLMs.","Chomba Bupe, a prominent figure in the AI community, has highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) a significant issue: LLMs tend to excel in tasks and datasets they were trained on but falter with newer, unseen data. The crux of the problem lies in the static nature of these models\u0027 post-training. Once their learning phase is complete, their ability to adapt to new and evolving input distributions is restricted, leading to a gradual decline in performance.","","Source: DALL’E Generation","This degradation is especially concerning in domains like programming, where language models are employed and where updates to programming languages are frequent. Bupe points out that the fundamental design of LLMs is more about memorization than understanding, which limits their effectiveness in tackling new challenges.","The research conducted by Changmao Li and Jeffrey Flanigan further supports this viewpoint. They found that LLMs like GPT-3 demonstrate superior performance on datasets that predate their training data. This discovery indicates a phenomenon known as task contamination, where the models\u0027 zero-shot and few-shot capabilities are compromised by their training data\u0027s limitations.","Continual learning, as discussed by Bupe, emerges as a key area in machine intelligence. The challenge is developing ML models that can adapt to new information without compromising their performance on previously learned tasks. This difficulty is contrasted with the adaptability of biological neural networks, which manage to learn and adapt without similar drawbacks.","Alvin De Cruz offers an alternate perspective, suggesting the issue might lie in the evolving expectations from humans rather than the models\u0027 inherent limitations. However, Bupe counters this by emphasizing the long-standing nature of these challenges in AI, particularly in the realm of continual learning.","To sum up, the conversation surrounding LLMs like GPT-4 highlights a critical facet of AI evolution: the imperative for models capable of continuous learning and adaptation. Despite their impressive abilities, current LLMs face significant limitations in keeping pace with the rapidly changing world, underscoring the need for more dynamic and evolving AI solutions."],"create_date":"2024-01-03T07:12:32.4260000","tag":"AI,crypto,blockchain,news","author":"blockchain.news"}
